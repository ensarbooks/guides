# Building an Advanced Firebase Application: A Step-by-Step Guide

**Introduction:** This comprehensive guide walks through building a full-stack Firebase application with a NestJS backend and a React frontend. Aimed at advanced developers, it covers everything from initial Firebase setup to deployment and scaling. We will set up a multi-tenant Firebase project with secure authentication, build a NestJS REST API secured by Firebase Auth (with role-based access control), implement a React front-end that integrates with Firebase Auth, and follow best practices for security, performance, and scalability. Each section provides step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and examples to illustrate key concepts.

## 1. Firebase Setup

Setting up Firebase is the first step. We will create a Firebase project, enable authentication (including multi-tenancy), configure necessary URIs for OAuth redirects and API access, and securely manage any sensitive keys or secrets.

### Creating a Firebase Project

To get started, create a new Firebase project via the Firebase Console ([Using Firebase Authentication in NestJS apps - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-firebase-authentication-in-nestjs-apps/#:~:text=First%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20create%20a%20Firebase,then%20click%20on%20Create%20Project)):

1. **Create Project:** Go to the Firebase console and click **“Add Project.”** Enter a project name and follow the prompts (you can disable Google Analytics for now if not needed) ([Using Firebase Authentication in NestJS apps - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-firebase-authentication-in-nestjs-apps/#:~:text=First%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20create%20a%20Firebase,then%20click%20on%20Create%20Project)). Click **“Create Project”** and wait for Firebase to set it up.
2. **Project Settings:** After creation, navigate to **Project Settings** (gear icon in the console). Under **General**, you can see your Project ID and other details.
3. **Service Account Key:** In **Project Settings**, open the **Service Accounts** tab. Click **“Generate new private key”** – this downloads a JSON file containing credentials for the Firebase Admin SDK ([Using Firebase Authentication in NestJS apps - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-firebase-authentication-in-nestjs-apps/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Screenshot%20of%20Firebase%20Create,NestJS%29%20side)). **Keep this file secure**; we will use it in the NestJS backend to authenticate Firebase. _Do not commit this file to source control._ (We’ll discuss secret management later.)
4. **Register App:** Still in Project Settings, under **Your Apps**, click **“</>” (Web)** to register a web app for the frontend ([Using Firebase Authentication in NestJS apps - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-firebase-authentication-in-nestjs-apps/#:~:text=In%20the%20same%20Project%20Settings,click%20the%20Add%20App%20button)). Give it a nickname (e.g., “React App”). You can skip Firebase Hosting setup here (unless you want to set it up now). After registration, Firebase will provide a configuration snippet (API key, auth domain, project ID, etc.). **Save this config** – we will use it in the React app.
5. **Enable Authentication:** In the Firebase Console, go to **Build > Authentication > Sign-in method**. Enable the sign-in providers you need (for example, **Email/Password** authentication) ([Using Firebase Authentication in NestJS apps - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-firebase-authentication-in-nestjs-apps/#:~:text=After%20this%2C%20click%20on%20Authentication,with%20their%20email%20and%20password)). This allows users to sign up and log in. You can also enable OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, etc.) as needed by toggling them on and providing any required credentials (e.g., OAuth client IDs for those providers).

At this point, you have a Firebase project with authentication ready. In a basic scenario, this is enough. Next, we'll enable multi-tenancy if you need to support multiple client organizations using the app.

### Enabling Authentication Multi-Tenancy

**Multi-tenancy** allows a single Firebase project to host multiple isolated user groups (tenants). This is useful if you are building a SaaS application where each customer organization’s users should be separated. Firebase Authentication supports multi-tenancy via Google Cloud Identity Platform ([
Solved: Multitenancy with Firebase (Is that possible?) - Google Cloud Community
](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Databases/Multitenancy-with-Firebase-Is-that-possible/m-p/637291#:~:text=Yes%2C%20it%20is%20possible%20to,users%2C%20authentication%20methods%2C%20and%20roles)).

1. **Enable Multi-Tenancy:** Multi-tenancy is an advanced feature of Identity Platform. In the Google Cloud Console for your project, enable Identity Platform and turn on multi-tenancy for your Firebase project ([
   Solved: Multitenancy with Firebase (Is that possible?) - Google Cloud Community
   ](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Databases/Multitenancy-with-Firebase-Is-that-possible/m-p/637291#:~:text=Yes%2C%20it%20is%20possible%20to,users%2C%20authentication%20methods%2C%20and%20roles)). (This may require upgrading your Firebase project to a Blaze plan, since multi-tenancy is not available on the free Spark plan.)
2. **Create Tenants:** Once multi-tenancy is enabled, you can create tenants. Each tenant is like a separate user pool. In the Identity Platform settings (Google Cloud Console under **Identity Platform**), add one or more tenants ([
   Solved: Multitenancy with Firebase (Is that possible?) - Google Cloud Community
   ](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Databases/Multitenancy-with-Firebase-Is-that-possible/m-p/637291#:~:text=To%20achieve%20multi,Authentication%2C%20you%20will%20need%20to)). For each tenant, you can configure allowed authentication providers. For example, Tenant A might allow Email/Password and Google login, while Tenant B has a different set. Each tenant will have a unique Tenant ID.
3. **Configure Providers per Tenant:** For each tenant, configure its authentication methods (in Cloud Console, select the tenant and set up email/password, OAuth providers, etc.). Redirect URIs for OAuth providers (Google, etc.) might need to include tenant-specific domains if you are using custom domains for each tenant.
4. **App Integration:** We’ll see in the React section how to direct users to the correct tenant at login. Essentially, the Firebase Auth SDK allows specifying a `tenantId` on the Auth instance. When set, all sign-in operations use that tenant, isolating the users ([
   Firebase Modular JavaScript SDK Documentation
   ](https://modularfirebase.web.app/reference/auth.auth.tenantid#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20readable%2Fwritable%20property,in%20to%20the%20parent%20project)). If `tenantId` is null, it uses the parent project’s default user pool ([
   Firebase Modular JavaScript SDK Documentation
   ](https://modularfirebase.web.app/reference/auth.auth.tenantid#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20readable%2Fwritable%20property,in%20to%20the%20parent%20project)).

With multi-tenancy enabled, each tenant has its own users and sign-in methods, while sharing the same project resources. It’s crucial to isolate data for each tenant in your database and storage, which we will handle via security rules and data structure (e.g., prefixing data with a tenant identifier) ([
Solved: Multitenancy with Firebase (Is that possible?) - Google Cloud Community
](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Databases/Multitenancy-with-Firebase-Is-that-possible/m-p/637291#:~:text=,can%20keep%20their%20files%20separate)).

### Configuring Redirect URIs and Authorized Domains

If you enable OAuth providers (like Google, Facebook, Microsoft) in Firebase Authentication, you often need to configure authorized **redirect URIs** and domains:

- **Authorized Domains:** In Firebase Authentication settings (under Sign-in method), add the domains that will host your app (e.g., localhost for development, and your production domain). Firebase by default allows `localhost` and your Firebase Hosting domain, but if you use a custom domain or multiple domains (especially in a multi-tenant app with custom subdomains), list them as authorized domains. This ensures Firebase will allow OAuth sign-in redirects to these domains and prevent abuse.
- **OAuth Redirect URIs:** For certain providers like Microsoft Azure AD or generic OpenID Connect, you might need to provide a redirect URI in the provider’s configuration. Usually, Firebase gives you a default redirect URL (of the form `https://<PROJECT>.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`). Ensure this URL (and any custom domain equivalent) is registered in the OAuth provider’s app settings. For Google and Facebook via Firebase, the Firebase SDK handles redirects internally, so you typically don’t need to manually set redirect URIs (just ensure your domain is authorized in Firebase as above).
- **Redirect after Sign-in:** If using email link sign-in or OAuth redirect mode, you can specify a **continue URL** (where to redirect after login). Configure this in your Firebase Auth settings or in code when initiating the sign-in. Make sure these URLs are allowed (Firebase Console’s auth settings has an allow-list for redirect URLs in email link authentication).
- **Multi-Tenant Redirects:** In a multi-tenant scenario with separate domains per tenant (e.g., `tenant1.yourapp.com`, `tenant2.yourapp.com`), you should add all those domains to the authorized domains list. Each tenant’s OAuth providers might also require setting redirect URIs that correspond to those domains.

### Exposing APIs and Configuring CORS

Since we will have a separate backend (NestJS) and frontend (React), they will communicate via HTTP APIs. You need to ensure that your APIs are accessible from the frontend domain and protected from unauthorized access:

- **API Base URL:** Decide how your React app will reach the NestJS API. If deploying NestJS as Firebase Cloud Functions, you’ll have a URL like `https://<region>-<project>.cloudfunctions.net/api/...`. If using another hosting (like Cloud Run or a custom server), get its domain (e.g., `https://api.yourapp.com`). We will use this base URL in the React app for API calls.
- **CORS Configuration:** Enable CORS on your NestJS backend for your frontend’s origin. In NestJS, you can call `app.enableCors()` with the allowed origin(s) when bootstrapping the app. For example:

  ```ts
  // Inside main.ts of NestJS before app.listen()
  app.enableCors({
    origin: ["http://localhost:3000", "https://yourapp.com"],
    credentials: true,
  });
  ```

  This ensures the browser can call the API from the React app’s domain without being blocked. Only allow the origins you trust (your own app’s domains).

- **API Security:** We will secure endpoints with Firebase Auth, but you should also ensure no sensitive data is exposed via open endpoints. All data-modifying or sensitive API routes will require a valid Firebase ID token (verified on the backend). This prevents unauthorized access even if someone discovers your API URL.

### Managing Firebase Secrets Securely

Firebase projects involve certain credentials and configuration details. Proper secret management is critical:

- **Firebase Config (API Key):** The Firebase Web API key and config found in your Firebase config snippet are **not truly secret** – they are safe to embed in the frontend. Firebase’s API key is only used to identify your project to Firebase and is not a secret token. However, you should still restrict its usage in the Google Cloud console (e.g., restrict the API key to your app’s domains) to prevent misuse.
- **Service Account Key:** The JSON file downloaded for the Firebase Admin SDK contains a private key and should be treated as highly sensitive. **Do not commit this file to your repository.** Instead, store it in a secure location and load it via environment variables or a secret manager. For example, place the JSON in a secure path on the server or use an environment variable to pass its content. In code, you might use an environment variable like `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` pointing to the JSON file path, or load the JSON and parse it.
- **Environment Variables:** Use a `.env` file for local development to store secrets (API keys, database URLs, etc.), and add this file to `.gitignore` so it’s not checked into source control ([Using Firebase Authentication in NestJS apps - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-firebase-authentication-in-nestjs-apps/#:~:text=The%20installation%20process%20for%20creating,firebase.config.json%60%20to%20%60.gitignore)). _“Environment variables stored in .env files can be used for function configuration, but you should not consider them a secure way to store sensitive information such as database credentials or API keys”_ ([Firebase cloud function secret in env file - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76073398/firebase-cloud-function-secret-in-env-file#:~:text=,env%20files%20into%20source%20control)). The main risk is accidentally pushing them to a repo or exposing them through logs. Keep .env files out of version control and limit access.
- **Firebase CLI Secrets:** If deploying Cloud Functions, the Firebase CLI (for 2nd generation functions) supports storing secrets via Google Secret Manager. You can run `firebase functions:secrets:set YOUR_SECRET_NAME` to store a secret and use it in your code. This keeps secrets out of your codebase and in a managed vault.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant access to secrets to those who need it. For example, if working in a team, not every developer or service account should have the Firebase Admin key. Google Cloud’s IAM can restrict who can access Secret Manager entries ([Firebase cloud function secret in env file - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76073398/firebase-cloud-function-secret-in-env-file#:~:text=The%20reason%20why%20the%20documentation,why%20Google%20Cloud%20IAM%20exists)). This way, even if your project is shared, the secrets remain protected.
- **Rotation:** Plan to rotate sensitive keys periodically. Firebase refresh tokens can be revoked (we’ll cover that), and service account keys can be regenerated if you suspect compromise.

By setting up the project correctly and securing credentials, we create a solid foundation for development. Next, we’ll move on to building the backend.

## 2. Backend Development with NestJS

We will use NestJS (a progressive Node.js framework) to create a backend API. NestJS will serve RESTful endpoints, and we will integrate Firebase for authentication and authorization. The backend will verify Firebase ID tokens on incoming requests to authenticate users and enforce roles (RBAC).

### Setting Up a NestJS Backend

First, create a new NestJS project for the backend:

1. **Install NestJS CLI:** If you haven’t already, install the NestJS command-line tool: `npm i -g @nestjs/cli`.
2. **Create Project:** Create a new project by running `nest new your-backend-project` in your terminal. This will scaffold a NestJS application (TypeScript-based) ([Using Firebase Authentication in NestJS apps - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-firebase-authentication-in-nestjs-apps/#:~:text=npm%20i%20,nest%20cli%20package%20globally)). Choose your package manager and wait for dependencies to install.
3. **Project Structure:** NestJS will create a structured project with modules, controllers, and providers. For our purposes, we’ll have at least an `AppModule` and an `AppController`/`AppService` to start with. We will add authentication-related code soon.
4. **Install Firebase Admin SDK:** In the NestJS project directory, install Firebase Admin SDK: `npm install firebase-admin`. This library will allow our backend to verify tokens and interact with Firebase services securely.
5. **Service Account Setup:** Place the Firebase service account JSON (from the Firebase project setup) in the NestJS project (or make its path available). A common practice is to put it in the project root (and **remember to add it to `.gitignore`** if not already) ([Using Firebase Authentication in NestJS apps - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-firebase-authentication-in-nestjs-apps/#:~:text=The%20installation%20process%20for%20creating,firebase.config.json%60%20to%20%60.gitignore)). Alternatively, set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the JSON file path so that the Firebase Admin SDK can auto-initialize. You could also load the JSON and initialize explicitly (shown next).

### Integrating Firebase Authentication in NestJS

Integrating Firebase Auth into NestJS involves initializing the Firebase Admin SDK and verifying incoming JWTs (ID tokens). There are a couple of approaches: using a NestJS guard with the Firebase Admin SDK directly, or using a Passport strategy (like `passport-firebase-jwt`). We will outline a straightforward approach using a guard with Admin SDK:

1. **Initialize Firebase Admin:** In your NestJS app (e.g., in `main.ts` or a dedicated provider), initialize the Firebase Admin SDK with your credentials and project ID:

   ```ts
   import * as admin from "firebase-admin";
   import * as serviceAccount from "./path/to/serviceAccountKey.json";

   admin.initializeApp({
     credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount as admin.ServiceAccount),
     // You can also just call admin.initializeApp() if GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is set
   });
   ```

   This should be done at app startup (before handling requests). Now `admin.auth()` and other services are ready to use.

2. **Create an Auth Guard:** NestJS guards can intercept requests and decide whether to allow them. Create a file e.g. `firebase-auth.guard.ts`:

   ```ts
   import {
     CanActivate,
     ExecutionContext,
     Injectable,
     UnauthorizedException,
   } from "@nestjs/common";
   import * as admin from "firebase-admin";

   @Injectable()
   export class FirebaseAuthGuard implements CanActivate {
     async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
       const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
       const authHeader =
         request.headers["authorization"] || request.headers["Authorization"];
       if (!authHeader)
         throw new UnauthorizedException("Missing Authorization header");
       const token = authHeader.split("Bearer ")[1];
       if (!token)
         throw new UnauthorizedException("Malformed Authorization header");
       try {
         // Verify the ID token with Firebase Admin SDK
         const decodedToken = await admin.auth().verifyIdToken(token);
         request.user = decodedToken; // attach decoded token (includes uid, email, etc.)
         return true;
       } catch (error) {
         throw new UnauthorizedException("Invalid or expired token");
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   This guard checks for a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header, verifies it via Firebase, and rejects the request if the token is not valid. Upon success, `request.user` will contain the decoded token info (like `uid`, `email`, and any custom claims).

3. **Apply the Guard:** Use the guard on protected routes. For example, in a controller:

   ```ts
   import { UseGuards, Get, Controller } from "@nestjs/common";
   import { FirebaseAuthGuard } from "./firebase-auth.guard";

   @Controller("data")
   export class DataController {
     @Get()
     @UseGuards(FirebaseAuthGuard)
     getSecureData() {
       // This route is protected by Firebase Auth
       return {
         message: "This is secure data visible to authenticated users.",
       };
     }
   }
   ```

   Now, any request to `/data` will require a valid Firebase ID token. Only authenticated users can access it. In effect, our NestJS API becomes a **resource server** secured by Firebase Auth tokens. On client login, Firebase issues a JSON Web Token (JWT) to the user, and our server verifies that JWT before granting access ([Using Firebase Authentication in NestJS apps - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-firebase-authentication-in-nestjs-apps/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99ll%20create%20a%20simple%20application,the%20validity%20of%20the%20JWT)). This setup ensures that requests without a valid token are rejected at the gate.

Alternatively, NestJS can integrate Firebase Auth via Passport. Libraries like `passport-firebase-jwt` and NestJS Passport can simplify token extraction and guard creation ([Using Firebase Authentication in NestJS apps - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-firebase-authentication-in-nestjs-apps/#:~:text=import%20,json)) ([Using Firebase Authentication in NestJS apps - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-firebase-authentication-in-nestjs-apps/#:~:text=export%20class%20FirebaseAuthGuard%20extends%20AuthGuard%28%27firebase,super%28%29%3B)). There’s also community packages (e.g., `@alpha018/nestjs-firebase-auth`) which provide ready-made guards and decorators for Firebase Auth and even handle token revocation and role validation ([Integrating Firebase Authentication into NestJS with nestjs-firebase-auth - DEV Community](https://dev.to/alpha018/integrating-firebase-authentication-into-nestjs-with-nestjs-firebase-auth-55m6#:~:text=This%20library%20extends%20NestJS%E2%80%99s%20authentication,that%20make%20it%20easier%20to)) ([Integrating Firebase Authentication into NestJS with nestjs-firebase-auth - DEV Community](https://dev.to/alpha018/integrating-firebase-authentication-into-nestjs-with-nestjs-firebase-auth-55m6#:~:text=For%20more%20advanced%20use%20cases%2C,validating%20these%20roles%20with%20ease)). Using such a library is optional but can reduce boilerplate. For clarity, we continue with the manual guard approach.

### Handling OAuth Client IDs and Authentication Tokens

In some cases, you might use external OAuth providers or need to handle client IDs/tokens:

- **Google OAuth Client ID:** If you plan to use Google Sign-In (One Tap or OAuth directly) outside of Firebase’s default, you might have a Google OAuth Client ID for your web app. In most scenarios with Firebase, you don’t need to manually use this in the backend; the client-side Firebase SDK and Firebase Auth service handle Google tokens and exchange them for Firebase ID tokens. Just ensure the provider is enabled in Firebase and your OAuth client ID is set up in that provider’s console with correct redirect URI. The NestJS backend mostly cares about the Firebase **ID token** that it receives, not the Google token.
- **Auth Tokens on Backend:** The NestJS server will primarily handle Firebase **ID Tokens** (JWTs). These tokens include information about the user and are signed by Firebase. The `verifyIdToken()` method we used checks the token’s signature, expiration, and audience. It ensures the token is issued by _your_ Firebase project (by checking the token’s audience against your project’s identifiers) and hasn’t expired. We passed the token string into `admin.auth().verifyIdToken(token)`, which returns the decoded payload if valid or throws an error if not.
- **Token Structure:** The decoded token (we attached to `request.user`) contains fields like `uid` (Firebase user ID), `email`, `name`, and any **custom claims** (we’ll use those for roles). It’s good practice to not rely on client-provided data beyond this token. Always derive user identity and roles from the verified token or your database, rather than trusting anything in request body that could be spoofed.
- **Refresh Tokens:** Firebase issues refresh tokens to clients but these are **never sent to the backend** in normal API calls. The client uses the refresh token to get new ID tokens from Firebase when needed. So your NestJS API will only see ID tokens. The refresh token should be kept in the client (or a secure HTTP-only cookie if you implement it that way). The backend can trigger token revocation (we discuss later) but generally doesn’t handle refresh tokens directly.

In summary, the "OAuth client IDs" mainly matter in the context of configuring sign-in providers, and "authentication tokens" that the backend deals with are the Firebase ID tokens and possibly custom tokens if you generate any. The heavy lifting of OAuth flows is done by Firebase on the client side; the backend focuses on verifying tokens and possibly minting custom tokens in advanced scenarios.

### Securing API Endpoints using Firebase

We have already applied the `FirebaseAuthGuard` to one route. Here are additional tips for securing your NestJS API with Firebase Auth:

- **Guard All Protected Routes:** Apply the auth guard (or an equivalent middleware) to every route that requires authentication. You can set the guard at the controller level to apply to all routes in that controller, e.g. `@UseGuards(FirebaseAuthGuard)` above the class definition, so all endpoints in that controller are protected.
- **Public Routes:** If certain endpoints should be public (no auth required), keep them separate or don’t apply the guard there. For example, a health check or a public info endpoint can be left unguarded, but anything that returns user-specific data or modifies data should require auth.
- **Role-Based Guards:** You can extend the basic guard to also check for certain claims. For instance, after verifying the token, you might check `decodedToken.role` or `decodedToken.admin === true` for admin endpoints. We’ll cover setting custom roles next. NestJS allows creating composite guards or using custom decorators to require certain roles.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure that auth failures return a proper HTTP 401 Unauthorized. In our guard, we throw `UnauthorizedException` which NestJS will convert to a 401 response. The client app should be ready to handle a 401 (for example, by redirecting to login).
- **CORS and HTTPS:** As noted, keep CORS enabled for only your allowed origins. Also, always serve the API over HTTPS (Firebase Cloud Functions and most cloud platforms enforce HTTPS). This prevents token interception. If you self-host, use TLS.

At this point, our NestJS backend is able to authenticate users via Firebase. Next, we’ll add role-based access control to differentiate user permissions.

### Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Firebase

Role-Based Access Control allows you to grant certain users administrative or special privileges. Firebase supports RBAC through **custom claims** on user tokens ([Control Access with Custom Claims and Security Rules - Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#:~:text=Firebase%20firebase,user%20signed%20in%20with)). Here’s how to implement RBAC:

1. **Define Roles:** Determine what roles you need (e.g., `admin`, `editor`, `user`, etc.). These could be simple boolean flags (e.g., an `admin: true` claim) or a role string/list in the token.
2. **Set Custom Claims:** Using the Firebase Admin SDK (typically from a secure environment like your server or Cloud Functions), you can assign custom claims to a user. For example:
   ```ts
   // Somewhere in an admin route or script:
   await admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(uid, { role: "admin" });
   ```
   This will attach `role: "admin"` to the user with that UID. The next time the user’s ID token is minted (immediately if they sign in anew, or within an hour otherwise), it will contain this custom claim.
3. **Use Claims in Guard:** Modify your `FirebaseAuthGuard` or create a separate `RolesGuard` to check for the claim:
   ```ts
   if (decodedToken.role !== "admin") {
     throw new ForbiddenException("Insufficient permissions");
   }
   ```
   You could also structure it so that you have a decorator, e.g., `@Roles('admin')` on a route, and the guard reads the required roles from the context. NestJS’s documentation and community libraries provide patterns for this. The `nestjs-firebase-auth` library, for instance, directly supports validating custom claims for RBAC ([Integrating Firebase Authentication into NestJS with nestjs-firebase-auth - DEV Community](https://dev.to/alpha018/integrating-firebase-authentication-into-nestjs-with-nestjs-firebase-auth-55m6#:~:text=For%20more%20advanced%20use%20cases%2C,validating%20these%20roles%20with%20ease)).
4. **Secure Routes by Role:** Apply these checks to routes that should be restricted. For example, an `/admin/*` set of endpoints should only allow users with the admin role.
5. **Frontend Handling:** In the frontend, you can also inspect the user’s token result or use Firebase to check custom claims (Firebase doesn’t directly expose custom claims in the client SDK’s user object, but you can embed them in an ID token and use that if needed). Usually, the client doesn’t need to know the roles, but if you want to show/hide UI based on roles, you might call a custom endpoint (protected) that returns the user’s roles or include that info in your user profiles in the database.

Remember to protect the mechanism that assigns roles. For example, only a server admin or a secure Cloud Function should call `setCustomUserClaims`. You might set up an admin interface that itself is protected by an admin account.

With RBAC in place, your NestJS backend can differentiate regular users and privileged users. We have a fully secured backend that trusts Firebase for authentication and uses Firebase’s data (tokens and claims) for authorization decisions. Next, we integrate the frontend.

## 3. Frontend Development with React

The React frontend will provide the user interface for authentication and for interacting with the backend. We will configure Firebase Authentication in the React app, handle multi-tenancy (if applicable), and ensure that API calls include the proper auth tokens.

### Configuring Firebase Authentication in React

Start by setting up Firebase in your React project:

1. **Install Firebase SDK:** In your React project (assumed to be created with Create React App, Vite, or similar), install Firebase: `npm install firebase` (this gives you the client SDK).
2. **Firebase Config:** Retrieve the Firebase config object from the Firebase console (Project Settings > General > Your Apps, as we saved earlier). It contains keys like `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, etc. Add this config to your React project. For security, you might store this in an environment file (e.g., as REACT*APP*... variables) but remember, these values will be exposed in the frontend bundle. That’s okay because as mentioned, they are not secret – just don't include anything sensitive like private keys.
3. **Initialize Firebase App:** Initialize Firebase in your React code (e.g., in a `firebase.js` file):

   ```js
   // firebase.js
   import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
   import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "<your-apiKey>",
     authDomain: "<your-authDomain>",
     projectId: "<your-projectId>",
     // ...other keys like storageBucket, appId, etc.
   };

   const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   export const auth = getAuth(app);
   ```

   This sets up the Firebase App and Auth instance we will use for login.

4. **Authentication UI:** You have options:
   - **Custom UI:** Use Firebase Auth functions like `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`, `signInWithEmailAndPassword`, or OAuth methods (`signInWithPopup` for Google, etc.) to build your own forms and buttons. For example, a simple email/password login form will call `signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)`.
   - **Firebase UI Library:** Alternatively, you can use FirebaseUI or other libraries for pre-built auth flows. But assuming an advanced setup, you likely have a custom UI design.
5. **Auth State Management:** Use Firebase Auth’s listener to track login state. For example:
   ```js
   import { onAuthStateChanged } from "firebase/auth";
   onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
     // This callback runs whenever the auth state changes (login, logout, token refresh)
     if (user) {
       // user is signed in
       console.log("Logged in as:", user.uid);
     } else {
       // user is signed out
     }
   });
   ```
   This helps your React app respond to sign-in/sign-out (e.g., redirect to dashboard or show login page).
6. **Sign-Out:** Implement logout by calling `signOut(auth)` when the user clicks "logout".

At this stage, your React app can register and sign in users via Firebase. The Firebase SDK will handle all the token management under the hood.

### Using Client IDs for Authentication and API Access

In the context of Firebase and React, "client ID" can refer to a few things:

- **Firebase Web App ID:** When you created the Firebase web app in the console, Firebase also associates an **App ID** (often in the config as `appId`). This is used internally by Firebase (for Analytics, etc.) and not something you directly use in code beyond including it in the config.
- **OAuth Client IDs:** If you use Google Sign-In or other OAuth providers, you might have set up an OAuth client in Google Cloud or with the provider. For Google, Firebase projects by default use a generic OAuth client for authentication. If you require the Google One-Tap sign-in, you would use the web client ID in the front-end initialization of One-Tap. For instance, Google One Tap might require:
  ```html
  <script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client" async defer></script>
  <div
    id="g_id_onload"
    data-client_id="YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_WEB_CLIENT_ID"
    data-callback="handleCredentialResponse"
  ></div>
  ```
  However, if using Firebase’s `signInWithPopup(auth, provider)` for Google, you typically **do not need** to manually provide the client ID; Firebase uses the project’s credentials.
- **API Access Client ID:** Sometimes, when using services like Google APIs, you might use OAuth client credentials to access them. But in our architecture, the React app simply communicates with our NestJS API (which in turn may use Firebase Admin or other services). We aren’t directly using Google APIs from the React app except via Firebase.

In summary, you don't usually have to handle any "client ID" explicitly in a Firebase React app aside from including the config. The important piece for API access is the **Firebase ID token**, which we will retrieve and send with requests. The React app acts as an OAuth2 client to Firebase (with Firebase as the auth server) implicitly.

### Handling Multi-Tenancy in React

If multi-tenancy is enabled, the React app must be aware of which tenant it’s operating under:

1. **Determining Tenant:** There are a couple of approaches:
   - **Subdomain per Tenant:** e.g., tenant1.app.com, tenant2.app.com. Your app could detect the subdomain (window.location) and infer the tenant ID from it (perhaps by mapping `tenant1` -> Firebase tenant ID).
   - **User Selection:** Alternatively, you might have a dropdown or input where the user selects their tenant (company) when logging in.
   - **Separate App Instances:** In some cases, you might even build separate deployments for each tenant with their specific config, but that’s less common and not necessary with Firebase multi-tenancy.
2. **Set Auth Tenant ID:** The Firebase Web SDK allows setting the tenant on the Auth instance. Using the Auth object we initialized, do:
   ```js
   import { auth } from "./firebase";
   auth.tenantId = "<TENANT_ID>";
   ```
   where `<TENANT_ID>` is the identifier of the tenant the user is trying to log into. For example, if the user is on tenant1.app.com, set `auth.tenantId = "tenant1-id"` (the actual tenant UID from Firebase). **Important:** This should be set **before** any sign-in method is called. Once set, all future sign-in/sign-up calls will go to that tenant’s user pool ([
   Firebase Modular JavaScript SDK Documentation
   ](https://modularfirebase.web.app/reference/auth.auth.tenantid#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20readable%2Fwritable%20property,in%20to%20the%20parent%20project)). If set to `null`, it targets the default project users ([
   Firebase Modular JavaScript SDK Documentation
   ](https://modularfirebase.web.app/reference/auth.auth.tenantid#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20readable%2Fwritable%20property,in%20to%20the%20parent%20project)).
3. **UI Adjustments:** You might show tenant-specific branding or text once you know the tenant. That’s outside Firebase Auth’s scope but part of multi-tenant UI experience.
4. **After Sign-In:** Once signed in, Firebase knows which tenant the user belongs to (the ID token will have a `tenant` field). On the backend, the decoded token will contain `firebase.identities` and possibly `firebase.tenant` to indicate the tenant. You can retrieve `decodedToken.tenantId` on the server if needed to enforce tenant-based rules.
5. **Tenant-specific Data:** Ensure that when your React app requests data (e.g., list of documents) from your API or Firestore, it specifies or queries only that tenant’s data. You might include the tenant ID in API requests (though ideally the backend can infer it from the user's token or profile).

Multi-tenancy adds complexity in that your app essentially behaves like multiple separate apps in one. But Firebase’s support (with `auth.tenantId`) makes the auth part manageable. Just be careful to reset the tenant ID if needed (for example, if a user needs to switch tenant, you’d call `auth.signOut()`, set a new `tenantId`, then sign in again).

### Secure API Communication with Firebase-Authenticated Users

The React app will communicate with the NestJS API, sending the Firebase ID token with each request for authentication:

- **Include ID Token in Requests:** After a user logs in, you can get their ID token via the Firebase SDK. Firebase Auth maintains an ID token for the currently signed-in user and will refresh it as needed. You can obtain it with `getIdToken(user, forceRefresh)` (where `user` is `auth.currentUser`). For example:
  ```js
  const token = await auth.currentUser.getIdToken(/* forceRefresh */ true);
  // now include this token in API call
  const res = await fetch("https://api.yourapp.com/data", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  });
  ```
  The header format should be `Authorization: Bearer ID_TOKEN` ([Authenticate for invocation | Cloud Run functions Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/securing/authenticating#:~:text=Documentation%20cloud,ID_TOKEN%20must%20be%20an)). This is the standard for sending OAuth2 bearer tokens to a server. The NestJS backend (FirebaseAuthGuard) will look for this header.
- **Automating Token Attachment:** To avoid manually fetching token for every request, you can set up an Axios interceptor or a fetch wrapper that always retrieves the latest token and includes it. The Firebase ID token will expire every 1 hour, but the Firebase SDK will transparently refresh it when you call `getIdToken()` if it's close to expiration. This means the user stays logged in without you needing to handle refresh logic manually.
- **Error Handling:** If the backend returns 401 Unauthorized (for instance, token is invalid or user no longer exists), you should handle it on the client. Possibly prompt the user to re-login if their session expired or was revoked.
- **Realtime Considerations:** If you use Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore directly from the React app, Firebase handles auth for those calls internally (no need for tokens in fetch). But for our custom API, we handle auth via these HTTP headers.
- **Calls from Multiple Places:** Ensure every part of your app that calls the API includes the auth header. A common pattern is to create a centralized API module that wraps all fetch/axios calls and injects the token automatically.
- **Logout Flow:** On logout, call `auth.signOut()` to clear the user. After sign-out, ensure your app stops including old tokens in requests and redirects to a login page.

By following these practices, all communication between React and your backend will be authenticated and secure. The front-end obtains the ID token from Firebase (which the user got by logging in), and attaches it to requests; the backend verifies it. This way, even if someone tries to call your API directly, they must provide a valid token.

## 4. Security Best Practices

Security is paramount in a production application. Beyond the basic auth setup, we should implement best practices for secret management, protecting APIs, and handling user sessions/tokens safely.

### Secret Management and Environment Variables

Managing secrets properly prevents leakage of sensitive information:

- **Never Commit Secrets:** As noted, keys like service account JSON, API secrets, etc., should not be in your git repo. Use environment-specific configuration. For example, in development, use a `.env.local` file (gitignored). In production, use environment variables set on the host or CI/CD.
- **Use Secret Manager for Production:** Firebase (Google Cloud) provides Secret Manager integration. Instead of storing secrets in plain text in your code or config, store them in Secret Manager and load them at runtime. For Cloud Functions, you can use `firebase functions:config:set` for simple config, or the newer `firebase functions:secrets` commands for secure secrets that are versioned and encrypted.
- **Limit Access:** As recommended by Google, _the primary issue with .env files is the risk of exposing secrets in source control or to team members who shouldn't have access_ ([Firebase cloud function secret in env file - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76073398/firebase-cloud-function-secret-in-env-file#:~:text=So%20the%20primary%20issue%20here%2C,exposing%20secrets%20in%20source%20control)). If multiple people work on the project, leverage IAM to restrict who can view secrets. For instance, developers can deploy functions without seeing the actual API keys if those are pulled from Secret Manager at deploy time.
- **Runtime Configuration:** If your NestJS app is running on a server or container, supply secrets via environment variables or a mounted volume (for the JSON key). The NestJS ConfigModule (from `@nestjs/config`) is useful for managing configuration and can read from environment variables.
- **API Keys on Frontend:** While the Firebase API key is not secret, if you integrate any other API (e.g., Google Maps API or third-party services) on the front-end, consider the exposure. Many front-end API keys can be restricted by domain or have limited capabilities, which you should enforce in those services’ settings.

Keep reviewing your code for any accidental logging of sensitive info. Strip out any debug logs that might print tokens or keys in production.

### Preventing Unauthorized API Access

In addition to using Firebase Auth to secure endpoints, consider these measures:

- **Security Rules for Firebase Services:** If you use Firebase Firestore, Realtime Database, or Storage directly from the client, **configure security rules** to enforce authentication and data access rules. For example, Firestore rules can ensure users only read/write their own documents. Multi-tenant data should be segregated by tenant IDs in paths, and rules written to restrict access to the appropriate scope ([
  Solved: Multitenancy with Firebase (Is that possible?) - Google Cloud Community
  ](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Databases/Multitenancy-with-Firebase-Is-that-possible/m-p/637291#:~:text=,can%20keep%20their%20files%20separate)).
- **Validate on Server as Well:** Even if you have Firestore rules, when using a custom server, enforce rules there too. Don’t assume rules alone will handle it if your backend is acting with admin privileges. For example, if your NestJS server fetches data from Firestore on behalf of the user, ensure the server checks that the requesting user is allowed to access that data (e.g., their UID matches the document’s owner field or tenant matches).
- **Use Firebase App Check (optional):** Firebase App Check can help ensure that only your genuine app can access certain Firebase resources (like Firestore, etc.) by attesting the app integrity. It’s not directly applicable to custom backend auth, but if using Firestore from the client, enabling App Check adds another layer so that even with leaked API keys, other unauthorized apps cannot easily use your Firebase resources.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on your backend to prevent abuse or brute force attacks. For instance, an attacker could script calls to your API with a stolen token; rate limiting by IP or token can mitigate damage and stop flooding.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up Firebase Alerts or Google Cloud monitoring for suspicious activities, such as sudden spikes in sign-in failures or changes in usage patterns that could indicate attempted breaches.
- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review user roles and custom claims. Remove privileges from users who should no longer have them. Firebase doesn’t automatically expire custom claims, so an “admin” claim stays until you revoke it or disable the user.

By layering these security measures, you reduce the chances of unauthorized access beyond the authentication we've implemented.

### Handling Refresh Tokens and Session Management

Firebase’s authentication model uses short-lived ID tokens and long-lived refresh tokens. Here’s how to manage sessions effectively:

- **Token Expiry:** Firebase ID tokens are JWTs that expire after 1 hour. The client SDK will automatically refresh them using the refresh token ([javascript - How to shorten the expiration time on Firebase auth tokens for testing - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54810242/how-to-shorten-the-expiration-time-on-firebase-auth-tokens-for-testing#:~:text=,password%20or%20email%20address%20updates)) ([javascript - How to shorten the expiration time on Firebase auth tokens for testing - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54810242/how-to-shorten-the-expiration-time-on-firebase-auth-tokens-for-testing#:~:text=,recovery%20from%20potential%20token%20theft)). This means once a user logs in, you generally don’t need to worry about token renewal in the React app – it happens behind the scenes. The user will remain authenticated as long as the refresh token is valid.
- **Refresh Token Validity:** Refresh tokens do not expire on a fixed schedule. They remain valid until one of the following: the user is disabled or deleted, the user’s password is changed, or the refresh token is explicitly revoked via the Firebase Admin SDK ([javascript - How to shorten the expiration time on Firebase auth tokens for testing - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54810242/how-to-shorten-the-expiration-time-on-firebase-auth-tokens-for-testing#:~:text=new%20ID%20tokens,)). In other words, a refresh token could last indefinitely for an active user ([javascript - How to shorten the expiration time on Firebase auth tokens for testing - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54810242/how-to-shorten-the-expiration-time-on-firebase-auth-tokens-for-testing#:~:text=,password%20or%20email%20address%20updates)). This is why protecting the refresh token is crucial – Firebase stores it in local storage or secure storage on the client.
- **Revoking Access:** If you need to force logout a user (for example, you suspect the account is compromised or you remove their privileges), you can **revoke refresh tokens** using Admin SDK:
  ```ts
  await admin.auth().revokeRefreshTokens(uid);
  ```
  This invalidates all refresh tokens for that user. The next time the client tries to use a revoked refresh token (or the next time it tries to refresh the ID token), it will fail and the user will be signed out. You can detect on backend if a token was from before revocation by checking `admin.auth().verifyIdToken(token, true)` with `checkRevoked: true` – if revoked, it will throw an error indicating revocation.
- **Session Length:** By default, Firebase persists the refresh token in local storage, so the session remains even after a page reload. If you want shorter sessions (e.g., logout after X hours of inactivity), you have to implement that logic on the client (perhaps by calling `signOut()` after a timer or on unload). Alternatively, Firebase Auth has a concept of **Session Cookies** for traditional web apps where you might set a cookie on login that expires after a certain time, but in our SPA + API scenario, it’s simpler to rely on the built-in behavior.
- **Multi-Device Sessions:** If a user logs in on multiple devices, each has its own refresh token. Revoking on one device (e.g., via password change) will revoke all tokens for that user, effectively logging them out everywhere once their ID token expires and refresh fails.
- **Secure Storage:** On web, the refresh token in local storage is vulnerable to XSS attacks (if your app is compromised by malicious script). For high-security applications, consider using Firebase Auth with session cookies or storing tokens in http-only cookies via your backend after verification. That is an advanced setup where after user logs in via Firebase, you send the ID token to your backend, verify it, and issue your own secure cookie. Firebase provides APIs for creating session cookies from ID tokens on the server, which then serve as long-lived auth mechanism. However, this is usually only needed if you want to integrate with traditional web cookie auth or mitigate XSS risk by not keeping refresh tokens in JavaScript accessible storage.
- **Logout:** Always provide a logout option that calls `signOut`. This will clear the local token and prevent further use until login again. Also consider automatically signing out users after a long period of inactivity (you can listen to browser/tab inactivity, etc., though Firebase doesn’t provide this out of the box).

In summary, let Firebase handle the heavy lifting of session management via its token system – it’s built to be robust ([javascript - How to shorten the expiration time on Firebase auth tokens for testing - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54810242/how-to-shorten-the-expiration-time-on-firebase-auth-tokens-for-testing#:~:text=,password%20or%20email%20address%20updates)). Just ensure you revoke tokens if needed and handle logout appropriately.

## 5. Deployment and Hosting

With both front-end and back-end ready, the final steps are to deploy them. We will deploy the React application to Firebase Hosting, and the NestJS backend to a suitable environment (Firebase Cloud Functions as an example, or an alternative like Cloud Run). We’ll also touch on setting up CI/CD for automated deployments.

### Deploying a React Application to Firebase Hosting

Firebase Hosting is a great choice for deploying SPAs like our React app. It provides fast static hosting with CDN and easy integration with Firebase services:

1. **Build the React App:** Run the production build for your React app (e.g., `npm run build` for Create React App). This generates static files (HTML, JS, CSS) typically in a `build/` directory (or `dist/` for some setups).
2. **Firebase Initialization:** If not done already, log in to Firebase CLI (`firebase login`) and initialize hosting in your project directory:
   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   ```
   - Select your Firebase project.
   - When asked for the public directory, **enter `build`** (since that’s where the React build output is) ([reactjs - How to deploy a React App on Firebase hosting - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78182183/how-to-deploy-a-react-app-on-firebase-hosting#:~:text=When%20firebase%20asks%20you%20which,don%27t%20use%20public%2C%20but%20build)).
   - When asked if it’s a single-page app (rewrite all URLs to /index.html), answer **“Yes”** ([reactjs - How to deploy a React App on Firebase hosting - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78182183/how-to-deploy-a-react-app-on-firebase-hosting#:~:text=,as%20your%20public%20directory%3F%20build)). This is important for React Router to work, so that deep links are handled by your app.
   - This will create a `firebase.json` configuration file and (optionally) a default `index.html` if none exists in the folder.
3. **Deploy:** Run `firebase deploy --only hosting`. This will upload the contents of the `build/` folder to Firebase Hosting. If successful, it will give you a hosting URL (something like `your-project.web.app` and `your-project.firebaseapp.com`). You can now access your React app at that URL.
4. **Custom Domain (optional):** If you have a custom domain (e.g., `yourapp.com`), you can set it up in Firebase Hosting console by adding the domain and following the instructions to point DNS records. Once verified, you can use your custom domain for the app.
5. **Testing Deployment:** Navigate to the live URL. Ensure that the app loads and you can log in. If you get a blank page or 404s, double-check that the build output was correctly placed in the `build` directory and the Firebase.json rewrite rule is present (the init should have added: `"rewrites": [ { "source": "/**", "destination": "/index.html" } ]` for single-page app support).
6. **Environment Config:** If your React app uses environment variables (like `REACT_APP_API_URL` for your backend), make sure you set those before building. In many CI setups, you might have different `.env` for dev and prod or inject variables at build time.

Your front-end is now live on a global CDN. Next, deploy the NestJS backend.

### Deploying a NestJS Backend to Firebase Cloud Functions

One deployment option for the NestJS backend is Firebase Cloud Functions (specifically HTTPS functions for our API). This allows you to keep everything in Firebase and scale the backend automatically. Here’s how to deploy NestJS to Cloud Functions:

1. **Build NestJS for Production:** Run the Nest build: `npm run build` (this compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in the `dist/` folder by default).
2. **Setup Functions Folder:** In your Firebase project directory (you can use the same project as hosting or a separate one), initialize Cloud Functions if not already:
   ```bash
   firebase init functions
   ```
   - Choose TypeScript (or JavaScript, but TypeScript is likely since NestJS is TS).
   - It will create a `functions/` directory with a sample.
   - You can choose to skip installing dependencies if you plan to just use your Nest app’s output.
3. **Integrate NestJS with Functions:** There are two main approaches:
   - **Single Cloud Function:** Use NestJS’s ability to create an Express server and handle requests in one function.
   - **Multiple Functions (microservices):** Not typical for Nest – usually you deploy the whole Nest app as one function or container.
     We’ll do the single function approach.
4. **Wrap NestJS in an HTTPS Function:** In the `functions/src/index.ts` (or create one), do something like:

   ```ts
   import * as functions from "firebase-functions";
   import { createServer, proxy } from "aws-serverless-express";
   import { Server } from "http";
   import { AppModule } from "./dist/app.module"; // adjust path if needed
   import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
   import { ExpressAdapter } from "@nestjs/platform-express";
   import * as express from "express";

   const expressServer = express();
   let server: Server;

   const bootstrap = async () => {
     const app = await NestFactory.create(
       AppModule,
       new ExpressAdapter(expressServer)
     );
     app.enableCors({ origin: true }); // enable CORS for all origins or specify as needed
     await app.init();
     server = createServer(expressServer);
   };

   // Initialize the NestJS server on cold start
   bootstrap();

   export const api = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) => {
     if (!server) {
       res.status(503).send("Server not yet initialized!");
       return;
     }
     return proxy(server, req, res);
   });
   ```

   This uses an `aws-serverless-express` proxy (an approach to adapt an Express app to AWS Lambda / Cloud Functions). Another simpler approach without that dependency is:

   ```ts
   let initialized = false;
   const appPromise = NestFactory.create(
     AppModule,
     new ExpressAdapter(expressServer)
   )
     .then((nestApp) => {
       nestApp.enableCors({ origin: true });
       return nestApp.init();
     })
     .then(() => {
       initialized = true;
       return expressServer;
     });

   export const api = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
     if (!initialized) {
       await appPromise;
     }
     expressServer(req, res); // handle the request with the Express server
   });
   ```

   The idea is that on the first invocation, it boots up the NestJS app inside the function runtime (which might take a second or two, similar to a cold start). Subsequent calls reuse the initialized app. **Note:** Cloud Functions (1st gen) have a request lifecycle model, whereas 2nd gen (Cloud Functions for Firebase v2 or Cloud Run) might allow more persistent instances. Ensure you adjust accordingly.

5. **Deploy Functions:** Run `firebase deploy --only functions:api` (assuming you named the export `api`). This will deploy your NestJS application as a single function named "api". Firebase will give you a URL like `https://us-central1-<project>.cloudfunctions.net/api` for the function.
6. **Test the API:** Use a tool like curl or Postman, or your React app (update the API URL to the cloud function URL), to hit the endpoints. They should respond as they did locally. Keep in mind cold starts – the first request after a period of inactivity may be slow due to NestJS initialization in the function.

**Alternative - Cloud Run:** If the above seems complex or if NestJS cold start is a concern, you can deploy NestJS to Cloud Run (a Docker container). That involves containerizing the Nest app (writing a Dockerfile), building it, and deploying via `gcloud run deploy`. Cloud Run can also authenticate with Firebase (via Firebase Auth JWTs, similar verification code). Cloud Run might give more consistent performance for a heavier app and can be more straightforward to run a full Node server. It’s worth considering if Cloud Functions constraints become an issue (e.g., function memory/time limits, or want to avoid the proxy approach).

### Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines for Firebase Projects

Manual deployments can be error-prone, so setting up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is advisable:

- **GitHub Actions for Firebase Hosting/Functions:** Firebase provides an official GitHub Action for deploying to Hosting and Functions. You can use it to automate deploys on every push to main or on pull requests to a preview channel ([Deploy to live & preview channels via GitHub pull requests - Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/github-integration#:~:text=Firebase%20firebase.google.com%20%20The%20,live)). The easiest way to set this up is by selecting the GitHub Action setup when running `firebase init`. During init, if you enable the option **“Hosting: Set up GitHub Action deploys”**, the CLI will automatically create a GitHub Actions workflow file in your repo and add necessary secrets ([Deploying Firebase Services with GitHub Actions: A Step-by-Step Guide | by Sargis Vardanyan | Octa Labs Insights](https://blog.octalabs.com/deploying-firebase-services-with-github-actions-a-step-by-step-guide-6b6e8289941a#:~:text=Initializing%20Firebase%20Project%20After%20login,use%20existing%20firebase%20project%20by)). It provisions a service account with permissions and stores the credentials (as `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_<projectID>` secret) in your GitHub repository, so the action can deploy on your behalf.
- **CI for Functions (Alt):** If not using the Firebase Action, you can add a CI step that runs `firebase deploy`. For example, a GitHub Actions YAML job might:
  - Checkout code
  - Setup Node (use correct version)
  - Install dependencies (`npm install`)
  - Build the React app (`npm run build`) and Nest app (`npm run build` for Nest) if needed
  - Use Firebase CLI to deploy. This requires authentication. One way is to use the Firebase CLI Action or to use a deploy token. You can generate a CI token with `firebase login:ci` and add that token as a secret in your repo (e.g., `FIREBASE_TOKEN`). Then your CI can run `firebase deploy --token $FIREBASE_TOKEN`.
- **Split Workflows:** You might have separate workflows for frontend and backend. For example, when frontend code changes, deploy Hosting; when backend code changes, deploy Functions. Or do both together if they reside in the same repository.
- **Testing in CI:** Include steps to run tests (if you have unit/integration tests for your code) before deploying. This ensures only good builds go live.
- **Environment Separation:** Use separate Firebase projects for dev, staging, prod environments. You can set up CI to deploy to a staging project on pushes to a dev branch, and to prod project on pushes to main, for instance. The `firebase use --project` flag or `-P <project>` in deploy command helps target specific projects.
- **Monitoring CI Deploys:** Configure notifications or checks – for instance, the GitHub Action can comment on a Pull Request with a preview URL for the deployed app (Firebase Hosting supports Preview Channels automatically in the Action) ([Deploy to live & preview channels via GitHub pull requests - Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/github-integration#:~:text=Firebase%20firebase.google.com%20%20The%20,live)). This is great for reviewing changes.

Using CI/CD not only saves time but also reduces mistakes (like deploying from the wrong branch or forgetting to build). It also provides an audit log of deployments.

## 6. Advanced Use Cases & Optimization

Finally, we address advanced topics: monitoring application performance, effective logging and debugging in Firebase, and scaling the app for high traffic.

### Monitoring API Performance with Firebase Analytics and Performance Monitoring

Monitoring helps you ensure your app runs smoothly and identify bottlenecks:

- **Firebase Performance Monitoring:** Firebase offers Performance Monitoring for web apps which can track network request latency, load times, etc. By integrating the Performance SDK in your React app, you can automatically collect metrics on your API calls. Firebase Perf Monitoring will aggregate data for your API endpoints (grouping similar URLs) and report on response times and success rates ([Pinpointing API performance issues with Custom URL Patterns](https://firebase.blog/posts/2021/10/performance-analysis-with-custom-url-patterns/#:~:text=This%20is%20where%20network%20analysis,your%20most%20critical%20network%20requests)) ([Pinpointing API performance issues with Custom URL Patterns](https://firebase.blog/posts/2021/10/performance-analysis-with-custom-url-patterns/#:~:text=Out,worry%20about%20leaking%20user%20information)). For example, you can see that `/api/data` takes on average 120ms and has a 0.2% error rate. This is extremely useful to pinpoint slow or failing endpoints from the end-user perspective. It works by intercepting outgoing XHR/Fetch calls from the client and measuring them ([Pinpointing API performance issues with Custom URL Patterns](https://firebase.blog/posts/2021/10/performance-analysis-with-custom-url-patterns/#:~:text=Pinpointing%20an%20app%E2%80%99s%20performance%20issues,or%20even%20your%20own%20server)).
  - To use it, install `firebase/performance` and call `getPerformance(app)` in your React app initialization. The SDK will handle the rest (for HTTP(S) calls).
  - In the Firebase console under **Performance**, you’ll see charts of latency and a breakdown by URL patterns.
  - You can even define custom traces for code blocks or specific tasks if needed.
- **Firebase Analytics:** If you enabled Google Analytics for your Firebase project, you can use it to log events in your app that might be relevant to performance or usage. For example, log an event when a user performs a heavy operation or when a certain feature is used. While Analytics is more for user behavior, it can indirectly help performance monitoring by correlating, for instance, a spike in active users with increased API latency.
- **Server Monitoring (Cloud Monitoring):** Firebase Functions are integrated with Google Cloud’s Cloud Monitoring (Stackdriver). You can view function invocation counts, latencies, and memory usage in the Cloud Console. Set up **alerts** for when error rates go above a threshold or memory usage is near the limit.
- **Custom Monitoring:** For more advanced needs, you could integrate third-party APM tools or logging of performance metrics from the NestJS side. For instance, use NestJS interceptors to measure how long each request takes and log it. However, leveraging Firebase’s built-in tools is often sufficient.

By analyzing performance data, you might discover, for example, that a particular API call is slow for users on the other side of the world – indicating you might need a CDN or multi-region deployment. Or you might find high error rates on an endpoint, leading you to a bug that only triggers under load.

### Logging and Debugging Strategies

Good logging and debugging practices make it easier to maintain and scale your application:

- **Firebase Functions Logs:** All `console.log`, `console.error` from your NestJS (when running in Cloud Functions) will be captured by Cloud Functions logger. You can view these logs in the Firebase console under **Functions > Logs** or via the `firebase functions:log` command ([Write and view logs | Cloud Functions for Firebase - Google](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/writing-and-viewing-logs#:~:text=Write%20and%20view%20logs%20,line%20tool)). Use appropriate log levels (`console.error` for errors, etc.) so you can filter by severity.
- **Structured Logging:** For NestJS, you might use the built-in Logger (from `@nestjs/common`) which can prepend context to logs. Nest logs will appear in Cloud logs. Ensure not to log sensitive data (like don't log full tokens or passwords).
- **Error Tracking:** Implement global error handling in NestJS (an exception filter) to catch unhandled errors and log them. You could integrate with an error tracking service (like Sentry) to aggregate errors across front and back end. Sentry has a Firebase integration for front-end and can be used in Node as well. This is optional but can be helpful for catching issues in production.
- **Debugging Locally:** Use the Firebase Emulator Suite to test functions locally. The emulator can mimic Auth, Firestore, etc., so you can run the NestJS function locally and hit it with the local React app. Alternatively, run NestJS in dev mode (`npm run start:dev`) and point your React dev environment to `http://localhost:3000` (if CORS is enabled for localhost). This way, you can debug with source maps, step through code in a debugger, etc.
- **Debugging in Production:** Cloud Functions doesn’t support attaching a debugger, but you can deploy a function that basically logs more info to debug certain issues. Use pre-production environment for such debugging if possible.
- **Front-end Debugging:** For the React app, source maps from the build (if not disabled) will allow you to see the original code in browser dev tools. Use React Developer Tools for component state debugging. If an auth issue arises, you can enable Firebase Auth debug mode by setting `localStorage.setItem('firebase:debug', 'true')` in the browser console, which causes Firebase to log verbose info about auth state transitions.
- **Log Retention:** By default, Cloud Logs are retained for a period (30 days for free tier). If you need to persist logs longer or analyze them, consider exporting logs to BigQuery or Cloud Storage via Google Cloud’s operations suite.

Effective logging will help you detect anomalies (for instance, lots of `UnauthorizedException` logs might indicate someone is hitting your API without valid tokens – possibly a scanning or attack attempt, or a bug in token handling). Debugging tools ensure you can simulate and fix issues before they hit production.

### Scaling Firebase for High-Traffic Applications

Firebase and Google Cloud are designed to scale, but there are limits and best practices when your app grows to many users or high data volume:

- **Cloud Functions Scaling:** By default, each Cloud Function can scale out to many instances if traffic increases. However, there are limits (e.g., 1,000 concurrent function instances per region per project by default). If you anticipate sudden massive traffic (say a spike to thousands of requests per second), you can request quota increases or use 2nd gen Functions (which run on Cloud Run and handle concurrency). You can also tweak concurrency settings in 2nd gen functions to allow a single function instance to handle multiple requests in parallel (which NestJS can do since it’s non-blocking for I/O).
- **Database Scaling:** For Firestore, avoid hotspots. Firestore can handle high throughput, but avoid writing too frequently to the same document or sequential document IDs. A rule of thumb: **limit write rate to a single document to 1 per second**, and for new documents in a collection, don’t suddenly insert thousands per second without distributing the load. Firestore suggests ramping up traffic gradually: _“start with a maximum of 500 operations per second to a new collection and then increase traffic by 50% every 5 minutes”_ to allow the system to allocate more resources ([Best practices for Cloud Firestore - Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/best-practices#:~:text=We%20recommend%20starting%20with%20a,You%20can%20similarly%20ramp)). Use batched writes and bulk operations when possible to reduce overhead.
- **Sharding Data (if needed):** If you hit Firestore limits (e.g., 10,000 writes/second to a collection), consider **sharding**: distribute data into multiple collections or documents. For example, instead of one big collection, use multiple collections (shards) and perhaps a Cloud Function or client logic to distribute writes among them. This is an advanced technique – most applications won’t need it. For Realtime Database, sharding to multiple database instances is also a strategy for extreme scale ([How Firebase Developers Can Handle High Traffic Events | MoldStud](https://moldstud.com/articles/p-how-firebase-developers-can-handle-high-traffic-events#:~:text=Horizontal%20sharding%20is%20a%20technique,for%20improved%20performance%20and%20scalability)) ([How Firebase Developers Can Handle High Traffic Events | MoldStud](https://moldstud.com/articles/p-how-firebase-developers-can-handle-high-traffic-events#:~:text=Implementing%20horizontal%20sharding%20in%20Firebase,implement%20horizontal%20sharding%20in%20Firebase)).
- **Multi-Region Deployments:** Firestore offers multi-region replicas (when you choose a multi-region location, your data is replicated across regions for resilience). But if your user base is global, you might consider deploying your functions in multiple regions (Firebase allows specifying function region) or using Cloud Run in multiple regions behind a load balancer. This reduces latency by serving users from a region near them.
- **CDN and Caching:** Firebase Hosting is backed by a CDN which helps serve static content quickly worldwide. For dynamic content (your API responses), you might implement caching for expensive calls. Cloud Functions/Run can use in-memory cache or integrate with services like Cloud Cache or even cache at the client (depending on data consistency needs).
- **Scaling Authentication:** Firebase Auth can handle large numbers of users, but monitor usage if you have millions of users logging in concurrently. Use the Firebase Status Dashboard to monitor any service issues. In practice, auth should not be a bottleneck; just be mindful of security – enable protections like reCAPTCHA for phone auth or Anonymous auth abuse if applicable.
- **Costs:** High scale will incur costs. Optimize to keep your usage within reasonable limits:
  - Use Firestore queries that are indexed to avoid large reads.
  - Prune data that isn’t needed to keep Firestore size down.
  - For Cloud Functions, heavy processing might be cheaper on Cloud Run or App Engine depending on the use-case.
  - Take advantage of Firebase’s free quotas for low environments and plan for scaling costs in production (set budget alerts).

Real-world example: a traffic surge event (like a viral campaign) could dramatically increase usage. Firebase will scale, but you might hit project quotas (like network egress or function invocations). It’s wise to do a **load test** in advance to see how your system handles, and request quota increases from Google if you expect to exceed default limits.
