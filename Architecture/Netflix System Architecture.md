# Netflix System Architecture – A Comprehensive Technical Overview

**_Target Audience:_** _Intermediate-to-Advanced Software Architects_

Netflix operates one of the world’s most sophisticated streaming platforms, serving hundreds of millions of users and accounting for a significant portion of global internet traffic (around 15% of worldwide bandwidth at times ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Netflix%20accounts%20for%20about%2015,problems%20exist%20to%20be%20solved))). Achieving this scale has required Netflix to pioneer new architectural approaches. This document provides a **deep dive into Netflix’s architecture**, covering its historical evolution from a monolith to microservices, the design of its global streaming system, and the engineering practices enabling its reliability and innovation. It is organized into major sections: high-level system design, microservices and cloud infrastructure, content delivery (Open Connect CDN and video pipeline), data systems (storage, processing, recommendations), client playback (streaming protocols, DRM, offline), DevOps and reliability (CI/CD, container orchestration, chaos engineering), security, studio (content production) technology, and the organizational culture behind these systems. Each section includes diagrams, examples, and references to Netflix’s own publications for further detail.

## 1. Historical Evolution of Netflix’s Architecture

Netflix’s technical journey spans over two decades, during which its architecture evolved dramatically to meet growing demands:

- **DVD Rental Era (Late 1990s – 2007):** Netflix began as a DVD-by-mail service. The system was a classic **monolithic application** running in a data center, handling user accounts, the movie catalog, and shipping logistics. Scaling was vertical (adding bigger servers) and relational databases were central. In this period, high availability and global scale were not primary concerns yet, as the service was US-only and not real-time interactive.

- **Transition to Streaming (2007 – 2009):** With the introduction of streaming, Netflix’s monolithic architecture faced new challenges. Streaming imposed real-time performance requirements and spiky usage patterns, and the company needed to support **video encoding** and delivery alongside traditional web pages. Netflix decided to migrate to the cloud rather than expand its data centers, chiefly to leverage on-demand scalability. In 2008, a major outage of the DVD rental systems (during an Oracle database failure) further underscored the need for a more resilient architecture ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=Online%20computation%20can%20respond%20quickly,that%20the%20various%20data%20sources)) ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20end%20of,of%20this%20to%20support%20rapid)). Netflix began a **cloud migration to Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, a pioneering move at the time.

- **Cloud Native and Microservices (2010 – 2012):** Rather than a “lift-and-shift” of the monolith to cloud, Netflix re-architected into a **microservices architecture**. The single DVD rental application was broken into many small, loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific function (user profiles, movie metadata, billing, recommendations, etc.). Services were deployed on AWS across multiple _availability zones_ for resilience. Netflix engineers, such as Adrian Cockcroft, championed this _cloud-native, horizontally scalable_ approach, where each service could be developed and deployed independently. By 2012, Netflix had hundreds of microservices running on thousands of virtual machines ([Netflix Cloud Architecture and Open Source | PPT](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/netflix-cloud-architecture-and-open-source/54130702#:~:text=Image%3A%20About%20Netflix%2069M%20members,3%20regions%20across%20the%20world)), enabling the service to expand rapidly in features and global reach.

- **Global Expansion and Open Connect (2012 – 2016):** As streaming demand grew, Netflix expanded internationally (into 190+ countries) and faced bandwidth costs and latency issues delivering video over long distances. In response, Netflix created **Open Connect**, its custom Content Delivery Network (CDN), in 2012. They deployed hundreds of Open Connect Appliances (OCAs) – basically caching servers – at ISPs and internet exchange points worldwide to serve content locally ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=A%20CDN%20is%20a%20geographically,is%20handled%20by%20Open%20Connect)) ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=,OCAs%20servers%20within%20the%20same)). This offloaded the bulk of streaming traffic (video data) from AWS and closer to users, reducing transit costs and improving quality. By 2016, Netflix declared it had completed its cloud migration: all customer-facing services were running on AWS, and 100% of video streaming was delivered via Open Connect.

- **Operational Maturity (2016 – Present):** Netflix’s architecture today is highly refined. The microservices ecosystem grew to **over 500 microservices** ([Netflix Cloud Architecture and Open Source | PPT](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/netflix-cloud-architecture-and-open-source/54130702#:~:text=Image%3A%20About%20Netflix%2069M%20members,3%20regions%20across%20the%20world)), all running in the AWS cloud and managed via robust internal platforms. They invested in tooling like **continuous delivery pipelines**, **container orchestration**, and advanced **observability**. Netflix also institutionalized **Chaos Engineering** (notoriously, via “Chaos Monkey”) to continuously test resilience ([Embracing Chaos: How Netflix's Chaos Monkey Transformed ...](https://medium.com/@abhishekv965580/embracing-chaos-how-netflixs-chaos-monkey-transformed-system-resilience-59082412591e#:~:text=Embracing%20Chaos%3A%20How%20Netflix%27s%20Chaos,based%20architecture)) ([The Netflix Simian Army](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html#:~:text=The%20Netflix%20Simian%20Army%20Inspired,abnormal%20conditions%2C%20and%20test)). At the same time, the platform incorporated new technologies: for example, adopting **containers** with the Titus platform (Netflix’s internal container cloud) and exploring new data processing frameworks for real-time analytics. Netflix’s recommendation algorithms also evolved, incorporating machine learning at massive scale and even leveraging “foundation models” by 2025 for centralized preference learning ([Foundation Model for Personalized Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Mar, 2025 | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/foundation-model-for-personalized-recommendation-1a0bd8e02d39#:~:text=Netflix%E2%80%99s%20personalized%20recommender%20system%20is,enhancing%20accessibility%20and%20utility%20across)).

Throughout this evolution, a few themes remained constant: **service-oriented design**, **automation**, and a unique culture of engineering freedom with responsibility. The following sections dive into the architecture as it stands today, reflecting lessons from this history.

## 2. High-Level System Overview

At the broadest level, Netflix’s streaming service can be viewed as a **two-part cloud** comprising: (1) the **control plane** on AWS that handles all non-video functions (UI, APIs, data processing, etc.), and (2) the **Open Connect CDN** that delivers video content to users. **Figure 1** below illustrates Netflix’s overall system architecture and how a user’s request flows through it.

([image]()) _Figure 1: Netflix high-level system architecture overview. The control-plane (AWS cloud) handles user requests via an API gateway (Zuul) and numerous microservices (for login, playback initiation, recommendations, etc.), interacting with databases and caches (Cassandra, EVCache, MySQL). Once a user hits “Play”, the video content itself is streamed from the Netflix Open Connect CDN (OCAs) closest to the user. The architecture emphasizes global distribution (via Open Connect) and microservices decoupling (via a robust API layer). Also shown are infrastructure components like the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) routing requests, the Hystrix fault-tolerance library wrapping service calls, and the Titus container platform orchestrating service deployment. Events (such as viewing stats) flow into a data pipeline with Kafka, Chukwa, and EMR (Hadoop/Spark) for analytics and machine learning ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Netflix%20operates%20in%20two%20clouds,Architecture)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=%2A%20Backend%20,DynamoDB%2C%20Cassandra%2C%20Hadoop%2C%20Kafka%2C%20etc))._

From the user’s perspective, using Netflix involves two primary phases handled by different parts of the system:

- **Control Phase (AWS Cloud):** When a user launches the Netflix app (on a TV, phone, laptop, etc.), all interactions up until clicking “Play” are served by Netflix’s backend systems running in AWS. This includes user authentication, browsing the catalog, getting personalized recommendations, searching for titles, and seeing details for a show. These actions are served by **application microservices** (running on AWS EC2 instances or containers) and leverage databases and caches for data. Netflix uses Amazon’s infrastructure (like EC2, S3 storage, DynamoDB, etc.) extensively for this control plane ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=monitoring%2C%20recommendation%20engine%2C%20background%20services%2C,DynamoDB%2C%20Cassandra%2C%20Hadoop%2C%20Kafka%2C%20etc)). Low latency and high availability are critical here to ensure a smooth user experience navigating the app.

- **Data Plane (Open Connect CDN):** When the user actually starts streaming a video (after hitting Play), the high-bandwidth video stream is delivered by Netflix’s Open Connect CDN servers, typically one embedded in the user’s internet provider’s network or at a nearby exchange. In other words, the **movie/episode bytes rarely come directly from AWS**; instead they come from these local caches. Netflix’s cloud control plane orchestrates the details – deciding _which_ CDN server and _which_ video file/bitrate to use – but the content delivery happens over the Open Connect network for efficiency. Over **90% of Netflix’s data traffic is served from Open Connect OCAs** rather than cloud data centers ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=transcoded%20on%20Amazon%20S3%20they,content%20is%20served%20this%20way)) ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=user%20experience,content%20is%20served%20this%20way)). This design is crucial for scalability: it minimizes long-haul internet traffic and offloads work from the core backend.

The three main components in this architecture can be summarized as ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=The%20overall%20Netflix%20system%20consists,of%20three%20main%20parts)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=%2A%20Backend%20,DynamoDB%2C%20Cassandra%2C%20Hadoop%2C%20Kafka%2C%20etc)):

- **Client Applications:** Netflix clients run on over 2200 device types – including smart TVs, streaming sticks, web browsers, game consoles, and mobile devices. These apps present the UI and handle user interactions. They communicate with Netflix’s cloud using web APIs and handle video playback using streaming protocols. Netflix’s web app is built with React, while TV and mobile apps are native to those platforms ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,interface%20with%20the%20Netflix%20servers)). The clients are responsible for adapting video quality (adaptive streaming) and enforcing DRM on the device during playback (discussed later).

- **Backend on AWS (Control Plane Services):** This includes all the application logic, microservices, and databases that power the Netflix experience (except the raw media streaming). When a request is made (for example, browsing a genre or starting playback), it goes to Netflix’s backend in AWS, which runs in multiple regions (to serve a global user base and for resiliency). The backend comprises stateless web services that scale out horizontally. It also includes **data storage** (user profiles, movie metadata, viewing history, etc., stored in scalable databases) and **data processing systems** (analytics and personalization pipelines). We will delve into its microservices architecture in Section 3.

- **Open Connect CDN:** Netflix’s globally distributed content cache network, consisting of thousands of OCAs across ISP networks worldwide. The CDN is somewhat separate from the AWS infrastructure; Netflix uploads video files to AWS (S3 storage) and then pushes them to the CDN nodes. When users stream, the video segments are delivered from a nearby OCA, which reduces latency and improves streaming quality. The CDN is tightly integrated with the control plane for coordination (e.g., the control plane decides which CDN node to use for a given user). Section 5 will cover Open Connect in depth.

By splitting responsibilities in this way, Netflix achieves a scalable architecture: AWS handles all the “smart” logic and stateful data, while a specialized network of edge servers handles the heavy lifting of content delivery. The following sections examine each part of this architecture in detail, starting with the microservices that make up Netflix’s cloud backend.

## 3. Microservices Architecture in the Netflix Cloud

Netflix is often cited as a prime example of **microservices architecture** in practice. Instead of a single monolithic backend, Netflix has built “**a collection of loosely coupled services that collaborate**” ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=2)). Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability – for example, there are separate services for user account management, recommendations, video catalog metadata, billing, device registration, playback control, etc. Collectively, these services interact to fulfill user requests. This section explores how Netflix organizes and operates its microservices, including service communication, resiliency patterns, and deployment.

### 3.1 Service Decomposition and Isolation

In Netflix’s architecture, each microservice is an independent deployable component. This independence means each service can use its own technology stack (though most are written in Java or Node.js) and can be scaled individually. For example, the “video encoding service” is separate from the “user profile service”, which is separate from the “recommendation service”. This decoupling yields development velocity and reliability – a problem in one service should not directly crash others, thanks to well-defined interfaces and isolation.

Some characteristics of Netflix microservices are:

- **Stateless Services:** The services are designed to be mostly stateless, meaning any instance can handle any request. State is stored in databases or caches rather than in memory of service instances. This makes it easy to scale out (add more instances behind a load balancer) and to recover from instance failures (a new instance can replace a failed one without lost data) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=4,be%20persistented%20to%20other%20data)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=5,processing%20of%20business%20intelligence%20tasks)). For example, if one “Catalog Service” instance goes down, the load balancer simply routes requests to another; there’s no session stickiness needed because state (like user’s current session info) is stored in a shared data store or passed with the request token.

- **Single-Responsibility Services:** Each microservice has a focused responsibility. Netflix even isolates critical functionalities into their own services. For instance, the service responsible for user movie recommendations is separate from the service that manages payment processing. This way, the complexity of each service is limited, and teams can own specific services. An anecdotal example from Netflix: there was a “Bookmarks service” that stored where you left off in a video (so you can resume later). If that service fails, it should not affect your ability to play a video – you might just not resume at the exact spot. In fact, Netflix identifies _critical path services_ (like those required to search and play a video) and ensures they have minimal external dependencies to remain highly available.

- **Independent Scaling and Deployment:** Services can be scaled based on demand for that specific function. The “Streaming Playback” related services might need to handle millions of requests (especially during peak hours or big releases), whereas an internal “Content Scheduling” service (for studio operations) might have far lower load. Each can be scaled on its own terms. Netflix also practices **independent deployments**, enabled by a robust continuous delivery pipeline (see Section 9): teams deploy their microservice updates without a centralized release for the whole application ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=This%20article%20analyzes%20the%20Netflix,system%20design%20for%20engineers%20course)). This results in hundreds of deploys to production per day across Netflix, a testament to the loosely coupled design.

- **Polyglot Persistence:** Each service chooses the database or storage best suited for its data. Netflix uses a mix of NoSQL and SQL. For example, a highly scalable distributed database like **Cassandra** is used to store user viewing history and other large-scale data, as it provides no single point of failure and cross-region replication ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Apache%20Cassandra)). Meanwhile, a traditional **MySQL** database (on AWS RDS or EC2) is used for the billing system, because financial transactions require strong ACID properties ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=MySQL)). They also use specialized storage like **EVCache**, a custom memcached caching tier (backed by SSDs for overflow) for extremely fast lookups of frequently used data ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,Image%3A%20EVCacheEVCache%20Diagram)). This tailored approach means each microservice persists its data in an optimal way, rather than forcing one-size-fits-all storage.

Netflix’s microservices count is enormous – by mid-2010s it was on the order of hundreds of services ([Netflix Cloud Architecture and Open Source | PPT](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/netflix-cloud-architecture-and-open-source/54130702#:~:text=Image%3A%20About%20Netflix%2069M%20members,3%20regions%20across%20the%20world)) and likely even more now. Managing this at scale introduces challenges: service discovery, routing, inter-service communication, and handling failures. Netflix addressed these with a suite of internal tools and design patterns, often released as open-source (the famous **Netflix OSS** stack). Key aspects of their microservices infrastructure are described below.

### 3.2 API Gateway and Service Routing

One of the challenges of a microservices architecture is how client requests find the right service. Netflix uses an **API Gateway** pattern to front its microservices. All client apps (whether a Netflix app on your phone or a smart TV) make requests to a unified API endpoint in the cloud, which then **routes** the requests to various internal services ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=1,Discovery%2FRecommendation%20API%20for%20retrieving%20video)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=2,handled%20by%20the%20Play%20API)). Netflix’s gateway is an internally developed system called **Zuul** (open-sourced as well), which serves as the entry point to Netflix’s cloud services.

**Zuul API Gateway:** Zuul is essentially a reverse proxy that handles incoming HTTP requests from clients. It applies a series of filters to each request, which can perform authentication, logging, dynamic routing, and other cross-cutting concerns ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=For%20Example%2C%20%2Fapi%2Fproducts%20is%20mapped,functionality%20to%20the%20edge%20service)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Zuul%20Architecture)). Netflix runs Zuul 2 (the second generation) which is built on Netty for asynchronous, high-throughput processing. Zuul acts as a “front door” – clients never call microservices directly, they always call the gateway, which then dispatches to the appropriate service(s) on the backend ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Application%20API)).

- Zuul provides **dynamic routing**: e.g., a request to `/api/users/123` might be routed to the User Service, while `/api/catalog/popular` goes to the Catalog Service. These routes are configurable and Zuul can map many URLs to many services as needed ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=requests)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=For%20Example%2C%20%2Fapi%2Fproducts%20is%20mapped,functionality%20to%20the%20edge%20service)). It also handles versioning or multiplexing – for instance, routing to different clusters for A/B tests or to new service versions during a migration.

- Zuul implements **filter stages** (see **Figure 2**). There are typically three types of filters:
  - **Inbound filters:** run first, used for authentication, decoding tokens, or routing logic (deciding which service to send to) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=heavy%20lifting)).
  - **Endpoint filters:** can either serve the response directly (if cached or static) or call the respective backend service(s) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,remove%20custom%20headers%20or%20metrics)). In Zuul 2, these endpoint filters often perform the proxying logic to the chosen origin service.
  - **Outbound filters:** run on the response path, used for post-processing like adding headers (e.g., for tracking or debugging) or transforming the response format ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=heavy%20lifting)).
    These filters make Zuul extremely flexible and are key to injecting cross-cutting functionality (like monitoring or throttling) at the edge.

([image]()) _Figure 2: Zuul 2 API Gateway architecture with filter chain ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=open)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,remove%20custom%20headers%20or%20metrics)). Zuul is built on a non-blocking runtime (Netty). Incoming requests from the internet hit the Netty server, go through a series of **Inbound Filters** (for auth, routing decisions, etc.), reach an **Endpoint Filter** which proxies or generates a response (often by calling the target microservice, indicated as “Origin”), then pass through **Outbound Filters** for any response tweaks before being sent back to the client. This design cleanly separates different concerns and allows Netflix to operate >80 Zuul clusters handling over 1 million requests per second ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,1%20million%20requests%20per%20second))._

Netflix’s API gateway is highly scalable. According to Netflix, the Cloud Gateway team operates “more than 80 clusters of Zuul 2, sending traffic to ~100 backend service clusters,” handling **over a million requests per second** at peak ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=service)). This gateway not only routes traffic but also provides a **layer of resilience** and security: for example, it can quickly return fallback responses if downstream services are unavailable, and it can enforce policies (like rate limiting or geo-blocking) right at the edge.

**Service Discovery:** Behind the gateway, Netflix needs to locate microservice instances. Netflix deploys many instances of each service (for load and fault-tolerance), often across multiple AWS availability zones. They use a service discovery component named **Eureka** (open-sourced by Netflix). Eureka is a registry where each service instance registers itself on startup (with its IP/hostname). Other services (or the gateway) can query Eureka to get the current addresses of instances of a given service. This allows for dynamic scaling – as new instances come online or others terminate (sometimes via Chaos Monkey!), the system adapts without manual reconfiguration. The API Gateway uses Eureka to find the healthy instances of a target service to forward requests to. Likewise, if microservice A needs to call microservice B, it looks up B’s location via Eureka rather than using a hardcoded address.

**Load Balancing:** Netflix uses load balancing at multiple layers. At the entry, they rely on AWS Elastic Load Balancers to distribute incoming traffic across Zuul instances and across regions/zones ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=1,to%20different%20user%20activities%2C%20such)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=4,be%20persistented%20to%20other%20data)). AWS ELB performs a two-tier load balancing: DNS-based load balancing directs clients to a particular AWS region/zone, and then within that zone the ELB forwards to one of many Zuul (gateway) instances. Internally, for inter-service calls, Netflix often uses client-side load balancing. They open-sourced **Ribbon** (a client-side LB library). The idea is that a service client will query Eureka for instances of the target service and then pick one using a strategy (round-robin or based on load). This avoids an extra hop for a load balancer and allows smarter decisions on the client side (like avoiding instances in a failing zone). So, a typical flow might be: Zuul receives request -> looks up “CatalogService” instances via Eureka -> forwards request to one instance of CatalogService. Similarly, CatalogService might call RecommendationService; it uses Ribbon to pick an instance of RecommendationService from Eureka’s list and calls it directly. This decentralized load balancing is suited for a microservices environment with many internal calls.

### 3.3 Application Layer and Orchestration

Netflix’s client-facing functionality is exposed via a set of **Application APIs** that the gateway routes to. These are sometimes also called “BFFs” (Backend-For-Frontend) or aggregation services. Netflix currently organizes its main application APIs into three categories ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Application%20API)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20Application%20APIs%20are,request%20to%20the%20Signup%20API)):

- **Signup API** – handles new user registration, account creation, free trial flow, and related non-member actions (also includes things like user login, since that’s part of access control).
- **Discovery API** – handles browsing, search, and recommendations (essentially all requests to get lists of videos, genres, personalized rows, etc. for the UI).
- **Play API** – handles playback initiation requests (when a member clicks “Play” on a title). This API coordinates everything needed to start video streaming (like license verification, choosing a CDN server, etc., described in Section 6).

These APIs act as an **aggregation/orchestration layer**. Rather than the client calling dozens of microservices, the client calls (via the gateway) one of these API endpoints, and then that API service will call multiple microservices on the client’s behalf, gather the results, and compose the final response. This hides complexity from the client and optimizes performance. For example, when a Netflix app loads the homepage, it calls the Discovery API, which behind the scenes might call the following microservices: MemberProfile service (to get your preferences), Personalization service (to get your recommendation rows), VideoMetadata service (for details of each title to display), etc., and then combine all that into the structured JSON response that the client UI code understands. The device doesn’t need to know about all those internal calls – it just gets one payload ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=If%20you%20consider%20an%20example,%E2%80%9D)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=in%20turn%2C%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20need%20to,%E2%80%9D%20Image%3A%20Api%20archi)).

**Figure 3** illustrates how Netflix’s orchestration layer separates external requests into different flows and then maps to microservices:

([image]()) _Figure 3: Netflix application API orchestration layers ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20Application%20APIs%20are,request%20to%20the%20Signup%20API)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Image%3A%20Api%20archi)). Netflix has distinct API paths for different types of requests – e.g., **Playback requests** from any client device (TV, Roku, Xbox, iOS, etc.) go to the Playback Orchestration Layer (the Play API, sometimes called “PBAPI”). The Play API will invoke a sequence of **Playback (PB) microservices** (e.g., for license checking, viewing history update, etc.) as well as some shared services. Similarly, **Discovery or non-member requests** (like browsing catalog, searching, signup) go to a Discovery/Non-Member Orchestration Layer (D/NM API), which calls its own set of microservices (search service, recommendation service, etc.). Some microservices might be shared between both flows (e.g., a “Global Search Suggestions” service). This layered approach prevents the API gateway itself from becoming too monolithic – instead the orchestration is done in these API services, which can evolve independently ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Application%20API)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=in%20turn%2C%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20need%20to,%E2%80%9D%20Image%3A%20Api%20archi))._

This design has an interesting benefit: it localizes the “workflow logic” in the API layer. The orchestration service knows which calls can be made in parallel and which must be sequential. For example, when a user presses play, the Play API might call the “Entitlements Service” (to check if the user is allowed to view that content in their region) and the “PlaybackContext Service” (to get the list of video URLs and CDN info) in parallel, but ensure that the “DRM License Service” is called only after entitlements are confirmed. The client doesn’t need to manage any of these dependencies – it just waits for the Play API response. This simplifies client implementations and allows Netflix to modify internal workflows without updating all client apps (which is important when millions of devices might be running an older app version).

### 3.4 Service-to-Service Communication and Resilience

With hundreds of microservices calling each other, **resilience** in inter-service communication is critical. Netflix’s approach to this has been to use defensive programming and middleware to handle failures gracefully. Notably, Netflix created the **Hystrix** library, a latency and fault-tolerance library, which became a cornerstone of their microservices reliability strategy (and influenced the industry by popularizing the “circuit breaker” pattern).

**Circuit Breakers (Hystrix):** In a distributed system, if Service A calls Service B which is slow or down, A might get stuck waiting and then itself fail, causing cascading outages. Hystrix prevents this by wrapping calls in a circuit breaker – if calls to a dependency start failing or timing out beyond a threshold, Hystrix “opens the circuit” and short-circuits further calls to that dependency for a cooldown period ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Consider%20this%20example%20from%20Netflix%3A,of%20the%20first%20circuit%20breaking)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=tailored%20list%20of%20movies%20back,of%20the%20first%20circuit%20breaking)). During that time, the caller can either fail fast or serve a **fallback** result. Netflix used this for scenarios like recommendations: if the personalized recommendations service fails, a fallback might return a generic list of popular titles ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=tolerance%20and%20fault%20tolerance%20logic)). This way, the user gets some content instead of an error. **Figure 4** illustrates a simple circuit breaker scenario:

([image]()) _Figure 4: Circuit breaker pattern with Hystrix (conceptual) – if Service B becomes unresponsive (marked with an “X”), the API service using Hystrix will stop calling B after a few failures and directly use a **fallback** (perhaps a cached response or default) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Consider%20this%20example%20from%20Netflix%3A,of%20the%20first%20circuit%20breaking)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=tailored%20list%20of%20movies%20back,of%20the%20first%20circuit%20breaking)). This prevents cascading failure to other services (Service A, C, D, etc.). Once B recovers, Hystrix will “close” the circuit and resume normal calls. Netflix’s microservices heavily utilized this pattern to achieve resilience._

Netflix’s scale meant that even rare errors happen frequently in absolute terms – so automating resilience was necessary. Hystrix also provided a **dashboard** to monitor service health and see when circuit breakers trip, giving engineers visibility into which downstream services are causing slowdowns ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=In%20any%20distributed%20environment%20,tolerance%20and%20fault%20tolerance%20logic)). (Notably, as of 2018, Netflix put Hystrix into maintenance mode and started exploring alternative libraries like Resilience4J ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Note%3A)), but the concepts remain the same).

**Bulkheads and Timeouts:** In addition to circuit breakers, Netflix employs other stability patterns:

- **Isolation (Bulkheads):** The idea of bulkheads is to partition resources so that a flood in one part doesn’t sink the whole ship. For example, if a service opens too many connections to a database, it could exhaust connection pools and affect others. Netflix’s services often run with thread pools or semaphores isolating calls to each dependency. Hystrix actually helped here too – each dependency could have a separate thread pool. If one dependency hung, it would only tie up its own small pool, not all threads of the service ([Embracing Chaos: How Netflix's Chaos Monkey Transformed ...](https://medium.com/@abhishekv965580/embracing-chaos-how-netflixs-chaos-monkey-transformed-system-resilience-59082412591e#:~:text=Embracing%20Chaos%3A%20How%20Netflix%27s%20Chaos,based%20architecture)) (thus preventing one slowness from crushing everything).
- **Timeouts and Retries:** Every network call has a timeout configured – no waiting indefinitely. If no response in e.g. 1 second, assume failure and apply fallback or try again. Netflix tunes these timeouts based on historical latency. Sometimes they also implement retries with backoff, though care is taken to avoid retry storms (retrying too aggressively can worsen a bad situation).

**Service Mesh Considerations:** It’s worth noting that Netflix’s microservice comms predate the modern “service mesh” trend. Instead of sidecar proxies (like Envoy/Istio), Netflix baked a lot of communication logic into libraries (Ribbon for load balancing, Hystrix for fault tolerance, Eureka for discovery, etc.). This served them well, though in recent years the industry is moving to service mesh proxies to offload that complexity. Netflix has not publicly announced moving to a service mesh; they continue with their proven Netflix OSS stack, while evolving pieces of it.

### 3.5 Deployment and Scaling of Services

All these services run on Amazon EC2 instances or in containers managed by Netflix’s own platform. Key elements of how Netflix deploys and scales microservices:

- **Auto Scaling Groups:** Netflix heavily uses AWS auto-scaling. Each service cluster can automatically scale out if CPU or latency indicates increased load. The Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) will start routing traffic to new instances as they come up. Conversely, on low load, instances can scale in. Auto-scaling combined with Netflix’s global user base means they can handle diurnal traffic patterns (e.g., nights vs. mid-day) efficiently. Figure 5 conceptually shows an ELB with an auto-scaling group (ASG) of service instances.

([image]()) _Figure 5: Amazon ELB distributing requests to an auto-scaled cluster of service instances across multiple availability zones. Netflix uses such patterns for most stateless services, scaling horizontally as load fluctuates. Auto-scaling policies and multi-AZ (and multi-region) deployments help Netflix meet demand surges and isolate failures._

- **Red/Black Deployments (Zero-Downtime Releases):** Netflix pioneered what they call Red/Black deployments (also known as Blue/Green). When a new version of a service is deployed, they spin up a new fleet (the “black” fleet) alongside the old (the “red”). Traffic is then shifted to the new fleet, and if all looks good (no error spike, metrics are healthy), the old instances are terminated ([Netflix Cloud Architecture and Open Source | PPT](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/netflix-cloud-architecture-and-open-source/54130702#:~:text=Image%3A%20NetflixOSS%20is%20widely%20used,released%20last%20year%20called%20Scumblr%E2%80%9D)) (the colors red/black are arbitrary; it’s simply two populations). This reduces risk as the old version can be quickly reverted to if the new one has issues. Their tooling (particularly **Spinnaker**, covered later) automates this. They also often do a **canary release**: deploy the new version to a small subset first, send a tiny percentage of traffic, verify metrics (latency, errors) against baseline. Netflix even built an automated canary analysis system to judge if a new build is fit for full deployment.

- **Titus – Container Management Platform:** As Netflix evolved, they introduced **Titus**, which is their internal container orchestration platform (similar in purpose to Kubernetes). Titus runs on top of AWS EC2 resources and was built on Apache Mesos initially ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Titus%20Architecture)). It provides developers the ability to run services and batch jobs in Docker containers, handling placement, scheduling, and execution at Netflix scale. Titus is deeply integrated with Netflix infrastructure (networking, discovery, etc.) and by 2020 was managing millions of containers per week ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20framework%20on,the%20Netflix%20version%20of%20Kubernetes)). Many newer Netflix microservices run as containers scheduled by Titus, whereas older ones might run on fixed EC2 auto-scaling groups. Titus offers advantages like easier resource bin packing and faster deploys (no need to bake an AMI for each change). In effect, Titus is “the Netflix version of Kubernetes” ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20framework%20on,the%20Netflix%20version%20of%20Kubernetes)).

- **Configuration and Discovery:** Netflix uses a centralized configuration service (they open-sourced **Archaius** for dynamic config) so that runtime properties can be tweaked without redeploying. Also, services register with discovery (Eureka) on deploy. Netflix’s deployment system ensures that new instances announce themselves to Eureka and unhealthy ones are removed, so that traffic only goes to live instances.

- **Multi-Region Distribution:** To improve reliability, Netflix runs its services in multiple AWS regions (at least three for critical services). If an entire AWS region has an outage (which is rare but has happened), Netflix can shift traffic to the other regions – a capability they test using a tool called **Chaos Kong** (which simulates a region outage) ([The Netflix Simian Army](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html#:~:text=The%20Netflix%20Simian%20Army%20Inspired,abnormal%20conditions%2C%20and%20test)). Data replication between regions is handled at the database layer (e.g., Cassandra replicating to cluster nodes in multiple regions). Netflix’s services are largely stateless, so the main concern is that the data stores are in sync or at least eventually consistent across regions. This multi-region strategy prevents a regional AWS issue from taking Netflix completely down, thus achieving worldwide high availability.

In summary, Netflix’s microservices architecture is characterized by decoupling, elasticity, and resilience. They built a powerful platform around these services to manage routing, discovery, and failure handling. Next, we’ll look at how Netflix handles the _data_ that these services produce and consume – from caching for performance to big data pipelines for personalization.

## 4. Data Storage and Management in Netflix

Powering Netflix’s microservices is a diverse set of **datastores** and a carefully designed data architecture. Given the variety of data Netflix deals with – from user accounts and billing information to a massive catalog of movies/series metadata to the trillions of events generated by viewing activities – they do not rely on a single database technology. This section outlines the main components of Netflix’s data storage and how they manage both online (operational) data and offline (analytical) data.

### 4.1 Polyglot Persistence: Operational Datastores

Netflix organizes its operational data by use case, employing the most suitable storage technology for each category:

- **Cassandra (NoSQL Wide-Column Store):** Netflix is one of the largest users of Apache Cassandra, an open-source distributed database known for high write throughput, multi-region replication, and no single point of failure. Netflix uses Cassandra to store “big” operational data that needs to be always-on globally – for example, _viewing history events, user ratings, and other logs or metrics_ are ingested into Cassandra clusters ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Cassandra%20is%20a%20free%20and,no%20single%20point%20of%20failure)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Netflix%20stores%20all%20kinds%20of,collected%20event%20metrics)). They favored Cassandra for its ability to scale horizontally across data centers while automatically replicating data between regions for disaster recovery ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=servers%2C%20providing%20high%20availability%20with,no%20single%20point%20of%20failure)). A concrete example: every time you watch something on Netflix, a “scrobble” (viewing record) is saved – these records are stored in Cassandra as part of your profile’s viewing history, ensuring that whether you switch devices or regions, the data is available. Over time, Netflix found that as user data grew, some tables (like viewing history) became extremely large. To keep Cassandra performant and costs reasonable, Netflix redesigned how they store this data. They introduced a model of splitting **Live Viewing History vs. Compressed Viewing History** ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=divided%20into%20two%20types%3A)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,Image%3A%20CompressedVHCompressed%20Viewing%20History)):
  - _Live Viewing History (LiveVH):_ the recent records (e.g., last few weeks) for a user, kept in raw, easily queryable form for quick access (so the service that shows “Continue Watching” or viewing activity can fetch recent history fast).
  - _Compressed Viewing History (CompressedVH):_ older records consolidated (compressed) into a single blob or a summarized form per user ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,Image%3A%20CompressedVHCompressed%20Viewing%20History)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,Image%3A%20CompressedVHCompressed%20Viewing%20History)). This dramatically reduces storage footprint while retaining the data for analytical purposes. By compressing seldom-accessed older data, Netflix achieved a **smaller storage footprint and consistent R/W performance** even as data scales ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=all%20user)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,as%20viewing%20per%20member%20grows)).
- **EVCache (Distributed Cache):** To achieve low latency for hot data, Netflix uses a tiered caching system called **EVCache** (Ephemeral Volatile Cache) which is essentially a fork of Memcached with custom enhancements ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,Image%3A%20EVCacheEVCache%20Diagram)). EVCache is deployed on EC2 instances (often with one instance per availability zone for locality) and caches key-value data in memory. It’s used for things like _user session data, personalized recommendations list, pre-computed “rows” of content for the UI,_ etc. – basically, any data that is expensive to recompute or fetch from a slower database is cached ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,Image%3A%20EVCacheEVCache%20Diagram)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=rely%20on%20caches%20for%20fast%2C,Image%3A%20EVCacheEVCache%20Diagram)). “Ephemeral” means the data isn’t permanent – it can disappear on memcached restart, and that’s okay because it can be recomputed or fetched from source of truth. Netflix has integrated EVCache with SSD storage as well, using SSDs as a second-tier cache to store more data than would fit in RAM alone ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=SSDs%20for%20Caching)). By moving some cache data to SSD (which is slower than RAM but much cheaper per GB), they found a cost-effective way to cache large datasets without hitting the high cost of large-memory instances ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=expensive%2C%20so%20Netflix%20decided%20to,some%20caching%20data%20to%20SSD)). This is useful for data like large recommendation lists or search indexes that benefit from caching but don’t all fit in memory.

- **MySQL (Relational Database):** Even in a cloud-scale architecture, certain use-cases benefit from relational ACID properties. Netflix uses MySQL for its **billing and payments** system ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=MySQL)). Billing data requires strong consistency (you don’t want to accidentally charge twice or miss a payment record) and complex transactions (applying payments, updating balances, etc.), which fit a relational model. Netflix runs MySQL on AWS (likely Amazon RDS or self-managed on EC2). This is one of the few strongly consistent parts of their user data. They handle millions of customers’ subscription states, payment methods, invoices, etc., in MySQL. By isolating it as a separate service and DB, they manage the load (billing queries aren’t in the critical path of playback) and can protect it more rigorously (security for financial data is tight). Notably, Netflix likely employs master-slave replication for MySQL and possibly sharding by region or user range to scale writes.

- **ElasticSearch (Search Engine):** For powering Netflix’s **search feature** and possibly for indexing logs/metrics, Netflix uses Elasticsearch clusters ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Elastic%20Search%20,and%20Monitoring)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Netflix%20uses%20elastic%20search%20for,error%20detection%20in%20the%20system)). Elasticsearch is based on Lucene and is optimized for text queries and analytics. Whenever you use the search box on Netflix to find a title, an ElasticSearch cluster is querying across the indexed titles, actors, genres, etc., to return results quickly. Netflix also mentioned using Elasticsearch for **data visualization, customer support tools, and error monitoring** ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Elastic%20Search%20,and%20Monitoring)). For example, support agents might query logs or user account data via an ES-backed interface to troubleshoot issues. Elasticsearch provides flexible querying over large datasets with near real-time performance.

- **Others:** Netflix has many other specialized stores:
  - **DynamoDB** (AWS’s NoSQL service) – Netflix has used DynamoDB for certain use cases like A/B test assignment storage or quick lookups that benefit from a fully managed store. Dynamo’s advantage is ease of scaling without operational overhead.
  - **S3** – Amazon S3 is heavily used as durable object storage. It stores the actual media files (movies, episodes) until they’re pushed to Open Connect, as well as backups, logs, and the output of big data jobs. S3 serves as Netflix’s **Data Lake** for analytics (see next subsection).
  - **S3 is also used indirectly via** AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR) and other data jobs that output results (like recommendation models) which might be stored back to S3 or Cassandra.

Netflix’s approach is to use the right tool for each job. This “polyglot” strategy does add complexity (managing many systems), but Netflix’s engineering teams are structured so that each major data system (Cassandra, EVCache, etc.) has a team responsible for it, providing it as a service internally.

### 4.2 Data Lake and Batch Processing

Beyond the online transaction data, Netflix collects a **massive amount of analytical data** – logs, events, metrics – that feed into improving the service (recommendations, UI decisions, business strategy, etc.). For this, Netflix built a **data pipeline** and **data lake** architecture, primarily using Hadoop, Spark, and related big data technologies on AWS.

- **Kafka Ingestion:** Most event data (e.g., a “play started” event, or a “button clicked” event in the UI) is first captured by services and then sent into **Apache Kafka** – the de facto message bus at Netflix ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Image%3A%20streaming)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Kafka%20is%20open,reading%2C%20and%20analyzing%20streaming%20data)). Netflix has embraced Kafka as the “bridge” for all asynchronous communication ([How Netflix Uses Kafka for Distributed Streaming](https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-kafka-is-used-by-netflix/#:~:text=Netflix%20embraces%20Apache%20Kafka%C2%AE%20as,tenant%20architecture%20required)). There are Kafka topics for various event types: streaming events, UI interactions, errors, performance metrics, etc. Dozens of producers (microservices or client telemetry collectors) publish into Kafka, and multiple consumers will consume these streams for different purposes (real-time processing, feeding databases, triggering alerts). Kafka is a durable, scalable log, well-suited for Netflix’s scale of events (Netflix processes **trillions of events per day** generating **petabytes of data daily** through its streaming pipeline ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=streams%20and%20responding%20promptly%20as,necessary)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=The%20stream%20processing%20platform%20processes,Image%3A%20streaming))).

- **Chukwa and Log Aggregation:** Historically, Netflix used Apache **Chukwa** (built on Hadoop) for collecting and aggregating logs/events into HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Apache%20Chukwe)). A flow might be: events flow through Kafka -> consumed by a Chukwa agent that batches them and writes to HDFS (which in AWS would be either HDFS on EMR or directly to S3 as sequence files) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Apache%20Chukwe%20is%20an%20open,S3)). Chukwa was mentioned as writing events in Hadoop file format on S3 ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=framework,S3)). Essentially, it’s a pipeline to get data from streams into the **data lake** storage for batch processing. Today, newer tech might supplement or replace Chukwa (for example, Netflix has an in-house streaming platform called **Mantis** for real-time stream processing, and they might use Spark Streaming or Flink for similar tasks), but the principle remains: continuously collect and store events.

- **S3 Data Lake:** Netflix’s data lake is largely **Amazon S3** storing a variety of datasets – event logs, aggregated statistics, extracted features, etc. S3 is ideal because it’s virtually unlimited and cost-effective for large-scale data. Data on S3 can be accessed via Hadoop/Spark jobs or even ad-hoc via tools like Presto. Netflix likely organizes data in S3 by date partitions, event types, etc., to allow efficient processing. This data lake contains, for instance, every movie play event with details, which is goldmine for analytics and model training.

- **EMR and Spark (Batch Processing):** Netflix uses Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) to spin up clusters for big data jobs. They historically used Hadoop MapReduce and later heavily adopted **Apache Spark** for faster in-memory processing ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Apache%20Spark%20,Data)). **Apache Spark** is a unified engine that Netflix uses for many offline computations: generating recommendation models, computing daily or hourly metrics, aggregating content popularity, training machine learning models, etc. ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Apache%20Spark%20,Data)). For example, each night Netflix might run Spark jobs that aggregate the total views for each show globally (to compute “Top 10” lists), or a job that computes similarities between movies for recommendations. Spark’s ability to handle large-scale joins and computations with relative ease (compared to classic MapReduce) made it a go-to tool. Netflix’s data platform likely includes custom scheduling for these jobs; they may use Apache Airflow or their own orchestrator to schedule pipelines.

- **Druid and Presto (Analytics):** While not explicitly in our references, Netflix has mentioned using technologies like **Apache Druid** or **Presto** for interactive querying by analysts/engineers. Presto is a distributed SQL query engine that can query data directly from S3 (or Hive metastore) with low latency. This would allow, say, a data analyst to run a SQL query to find “how many users watched at least 70% of Movie X within 7 days of release” by scanning event data on S3. Netflix’s culture of A/B testing and data-driven decision-making implies they have robust tooling for querying the data lake.

- **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Netflix’s famous recommendation algorithms are built on this data infrastructure. The general pipeline for ML (e.g., to generate personalized rankings) is:

  1. **Feature extraction:** Raw events (views, ratings, searches) are processed (with Spark or Flink) to produce features like “how many action movies has user watched in last month”, “genre affinity scores”, “device usage patterns”, etc.
  2. **Model training:** Using these features, models are trained (could be collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, deep learning models, etc.). Netflix in recent years uses a lot of deep learning; they might train models that embed users and movies in a vector space, or sequence models for viewing behavior. They use offline training on big data clusters, leveraging frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch on GPUs for complex models.
  3. **Model serving:** The resulting model (or its outputs) must be made available for use in production. Netflix often pre-computes recommendation lists for each user (especially in earlier days, they did nightly batch generation of top N lists for each member). Nowadays with faster data processing, they might refresh these more frequently or compute on-demand using fast services. A recent trend is Netflix developing a **“foundation model” for recommendations** – a single huge model that captures user preferences, from which various personalized lists can be derived ([Foundation Model for Personalized Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Mar, 2025 | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/foundation-model-for-personalized-recommendation-1a0bd8e02d39#:~:text=difficult%20to%20transfer%20innovations%20from,and%20utility%20across%20different%20models)) ([Foundation Model for Personalized Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Mar, 2025 | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/foundation-model-for-personalized-recommendation-1a0bd8e02d39#:~:text=distribution%20of%20these%20learnings%20to,tuning%20or%20directly%20through%20embeddings)). This suggests they are moving to a paradigm where a large centralized model (analogous to large language models in NLP) is used to generate recommendations for many different rows on the Netflix homepage.
  4. **Online integration:** The output of ML models is used by the Discovery API when you launch Netflix. Either the Discovery API will call a _Recommendations Service_ that looks up precomputed recommendations from a cache/database, or it might call a _Personalization Service_ that computes some scores on the fly (e.g., combining the model’s output with current context). Netflix does both offline and online: _“aggregated play popularity and take rate ... along with viewing history and past ratings are used to compute personalized content for the user on a live request”_ ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Netflix%20uses%20Apache%20Spark%20and,scale%20data%20processing)), meaning some features are updated live (popularity might be computed from recent data) but combined with stored user profile data to pick what to show.

- **Manhattan (Intermediate Stream Processing):** Netflix earlier built a stream computation framework called Manhattan (similar to Apache Storm) for “nearline” processing – not immediate like online, but continuously updating data faster than batch ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=personalization%20architecture%20is%20how%20to,are%20needed%20across%20the%20offline)) ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=intermediate%20Recommendation%20Results%20in%20a,public%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%20cloud)). For example, Manhattan could be used to update a trending list every few minutes based on recent events, bridging the gap between offline and real-time. Today, frameworks like Spark Streaming or Flink might be used similarly.

The **Stream Processing Platform** at Netflix processes _“trillions of events and petabytes of data per day”_ ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=streams%20and%20responding%20promptly%20as,necessary)). This pipeline is the backbone for analytics (to drive decisions like what content to buy or where to improve QoS) and for product features (like recommendations and personalization). Netflix has effectively built a self-optimizing system: user interactions feed into the pipeline, which improves the algorithms, which in turn improve user experience.

### 4.3 Caching for Performance: EVCache and SSDs

We touched on EVCache above as Netflix’s solution for distributed caching. Let’s detail how it improves performance and user experience:

**EVCache Architecture:** EVCache stands for Ephemeral Volatile Cache ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Two%20use%20cases%20for%20caching,is%20to)). It’s basically a memcached tier deployed across multiple AWS availability zones. Each data item is typically cached with multiple copies (one per zone) for resilience – if one AZ goes down, data can be fetched from cache in another AZ. EVCache is used heavily by microservices that need sub-millisecond data access. Examples:

- When the Home page API is assembling your rows of suggested titles, it likely retrieves those lists from EVCache (populated earlier by a personalization batch job) rather than hitting a slower database or recomputing on the fly. This makes the home screen load faster.
- Netflix’s “metadata service” could cache movie details (title, description, imagery links) in EVCache so that repeatedly requested info doesn’t hit the primary store every time.

EVCache nodes store data in memory (RAM) for quick access. Netflix sets TTLs (time-to-live) on cached items appropriate to the data – e.g., a personalized row might be cached for a few hours before refresh. EVCache is also often used as a write-through or read-through cache. For instance, when a user rates a title, the rating service might update Cassandra but also put the rating in EVCache so that subsequent reads (like generating recommendations) see it quickly.

**SSD Cache Extension:** A unique thing Netflix did was extend caching to SSDs ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=SSDs%20for%20Caching)). Since RAM is expensive, they offloaded less-frequently-accessed cache entries to solid-state drives. Modern NVMe SSDs are quite fast (though not as fast as RAM) but are far cheaper per GB. Netflix found that storing 1 TB of data on SSD is significantly cheaper than on RAM ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=expensive%2C%20so%20Netflix%20decided%20to,some%20caching%20data%20to%20SSD)). So, for very large caches (say the “entire catalog metadata”), they might use a two-layer cache: an in-memory hot cache and an SSD cold cache. This way, they can cache _more_ of the data (thus higher hit rates) without astronomical costs. Accessing an item from SSD cache might add a few milliseconds, but that’s still much faster than going to a database or recomputing data. This SSD cache concept was part of Netflix’s “Evolution of Application Data Caching” initiative ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,the%20same%20amount%20using%20RAM)).

Overall, caching is a vital part of Netflix’s data architecture for ensuring that the high volume of read requests (like loading UI data, personalization, etc.) can be served quickly and at scale. Netflix’s microservices often rely on caches as the first stop, falling back to databases only on a cache miss ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,Image%3A%20EVCacheEVCache%20Diagram)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=rely%20on%20caches%20for%20fast%2C,Image%3A%20EVCacheEVCache%20Diagram)).

### 4.4 Analytics and BI

While not the focus of the question, it’s worth noting Netflix uses its data lake for business intelligence (BI) as well. Analysts and data scientists within Netflix use tools to analyze viewer behavior, content performance, etc. They likely use notebooks (Jupyter) and query engines to dive into data. Netflix has a data portal where metrics like “completion rate of episodes”, “monthly active users”, etc., are tracked. They’ve shared that data-driven culture in how they decide on content investments and product changes.

In summary, Netflix’s data infrastructure is two-pronged: **(1)** a real-time, scalable set of operational datastores (Cassandra, MySQL, etc.) with caches to serve the product in the moment, and **(2)** a huge offline data pipeline (Kafka -> S3/EMR/Spark) to crunch data for insights and improved algorithms. These two are connected; for example, results from the offline side (like a trained recommendation model) are fed back into the online systems (like EVCache or Cassandra) for quick use by the service. This synergy allows Netflix to continuously learn from its data and quickly feed those learnings into the user experience.

Next, we’ll focus on specific _applications_ of this data and service architecture – namely how Netflix personalizes content for users and handles search and recommendations, which are prime examples of the data infrastructure in action.

## 5. Personalization, Search, and Recommendations

One of Netflix’s biggest selling points is its highly personalized user experience – each member’s home screen is tailored to their tastes using sophisticated recommendation algorithms. The systems that achieve this sit at the intersection of data and service layers described above. In this section, we examine how Netflix’s personalization and search works from an architectural standpoint: how data flows from raw events to suggested titles, how the recommendation engine is structured, and how search queries are served. We’ll also touch on the experimentation platform that allows Netflix to A/B test changes in these systems.

### 5.1 Overview of the Recommendation System Architecture

Netflix’s recommendation system can be viewed as a pipeline with several stages ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=is%20another%20form%20of%20computation,this%20architecture%20as%20well%20as)):

1. **Data collection:** Collect user interactions (views, ratings, likes, searches, etc.) and content metadata (genre, cast, etc.). This is done via the event pipeline (Section 4).
2. **Model computation (offline):** Use the collected data to train models or generate recommendation candidates. This could involve matrix factorization models that predict user ratings for videos, clustering algorithms to group similar content, or deep learning models to embed users and content in a latent space.
3. **Ranking (online or nearline):** When a user opens Netflix, the system needs to pick and rank a set of titles to display (organized into rows like “Top Picks for You”, “Trending Now”, etc.). The candidate generation may be offline, but ranking might be online using the latest context (like time of day, device type, etc.).
4. **Serving:** The final list of personalized recommendations is returned via the Discovery API to the client app, which then presents them.

Originally, Netflix’s recommender was heavily batch-oriented. They famously ran a **Cinematch** algorithm in the early days (the subject of the Netflix Prize competition in 2006) that would predict ratings. That was for the DVD era and early streaming – it was an offline collaborative filtering job that updated periodically. As Netflix grew, they developed many different algorithms for different purposes (e.g., one algorithm to pick the top X popular trending titles, another to pick niche titles you might like, etc.). By 2020+, Netflix had a “variety of specialized machine-learned models” for different rows and purposes ([Foundation Model for Personalized Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Mar, 2025 | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/foundation-model-for-personalized-recommendation-1a0bd8e02d39#:~:text=Motivation)). Each model was often independently trained.

Netflix recently recognized that maintaining many separate models was costly and that they often used the same data. This led them to envision a **unified recommendation model** – referred to as a “foundation model for recommendation” ([Foundation Model for Personalized Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Mar, 2025 | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/foundation-model-for-personalized-recommendation-1a0bd8e02d39#:~:text=difficult%20to%20transfer%20innovations%20from,and%20utility%20across%20different%20models)) ([Foundation Model for Personalized Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Mar, 2025 | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/foundation-model-for-personalized-recommendation-1a0bd8e02d39#:~:text=distribution%20of%20these%20learnings%20to,tuning%20or%20directly%20through%20embeddings)). The idea is analogous to a large language model in NLP: one large model that captures a lot of user preference understanding, which can then power multiple downstream recommendation tasks (continue watching row, top picks row, etc.) ([Foundation Model for Personalized Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Mar, 2025 | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/foundation-model-for-personalized-recommendation-1a0bd8e02d39#:~:text=Particularly%2C%20these%20models%20predominantly%20extract,tuning%20or%20directly%20through%20embeddings)) ([Foundation Model for Personalized Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Mar, 2025 | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/foundation-model-for-personalized-recommendation-1a0bd8e02d39#:~:text=paradigm%20shift%20in%20natural%20language,insights%20from%20this%20shift%20include)). This is an active area and in March 2025 Netflix discussed centralizing member preference learning in such a model ([Foundation Model for Personalized Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Mar, 2025 | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/foundation-model-for-personalized-recommendation-1a0bd8e02d39#:~:text=Netflix%E2%80%99s%20personalized%20recommender%20system%20is,enhancing%20accessibility%20and%20utility%20across)).

From an architecture view, what’s important is how these models are integrated:

- Netflix likely uses the data pipeline (Spark, etc.) to periodically train/refresh models. Some models might update nightly, others even more frequently if they incorporate near-real-time data (e.g., a sudden trend from this morning might be captured by a nearline process updating a “trending now” metric).
- The output of models (which could be a list of recommended items per user, or a set of embeddings) is stored in a fast lookup store. Historically, Netflix would precompute top N recommendations per user and store them (maybe in Cassandra or Redis) so that when you log in, it just pulls that list. However, with so many rows and algorithms, they might not precompute everything – instead they compute certain candidate lists and then filter/rank on the fly.
- A component often mentioned in Netflix architecture is **“Page Generation”** or the **“Ranking System”** – essentially, given many candidates for a user (from different algorithms), how to compose the final page. Netflix uses context (like “user is watching mostly comedies recently”) to decide which rows to show and in what order, and even which image to show for each title (discussed below). This page assembly logic is complex and constantly optimized through A/B tests.

**Combining Offline and Online Computation:** Netflix’s architecture blends offline and online recommendation computation for best results. As an earlier Netflix Tech Blog explained, they have:

- **Offline algorithms** that crunch lots of data and can use heavy computation (e.g., analyzing all users at once to find clusters or doing deep learning over the entire catalog) – these give broad, data-rich models but might be a bit stale by the time they’re used (data from yesterday).
- **Online algorithms** that react to the user’s current session or very recent data (e.g., if you just watched 5 episodes of a show, the system immediately knows to prominently show the next episode). These need to be lightweight to compute in real-time and have strict latency SLAs ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=Online%20computation%20can%20respond%20quickly,such%20as%20reverting%20to%20a)) ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20end%20of,This%20flexibility)).

Netflix combines both: The nearline component (which could be a streaming job updating counts) feeds intermediate results that an online service (the Discovery API’s personalization component) can use to adjust the ranking. For example, _“aggregated play popularity and take rate data, along with members’ viewing history and past ratings, are used to compute personalized content for the user at request time”_ ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Netflix%20uses%20Apache%20Spark%20and,scale%20data%20processing)). “Play popularity” and “take rate” (conversion of impressions to plays) are metrics that might be updated hourly or faster. Those, combined with your viewing history and profile, let Netflix decide not just _what_ to recommend but also _in what order_.

**Manhattan (real-time signal processing):** The Netflix tech blog from 2013 described Manhattan, a stream processing system, to handle nearline computations ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=personalization%20architecture%20is%20how%20to,are%20needed%20across%20the%20offline)) ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=intermediate%20Recommendation%20Results%20in%20a,public%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%20cloud)). For instance, after you watch something, Manhattan could trigger an update to your recommendations (maybe dropping that title from “continue watching” and adding something similar to it in “Because you watched X”). Manhattan or its successor likely reads from Kafka and updates some in-memory data store for recommendations.

### 5.2 Personalized Ranking and Page Layout

Not only does Netflix choose _which_ titles to recommend, it also personalizes _how_ they are shown:

- The ordering of rows and videos is personalized.
- The artwork (thumbnail) for a given video can be personalized based on what aspect of the content might appeal to the user.

**Personalized Artwork:** Netflix revealed that they generate multiple thumbnails for each movie/series highlighting different themes, and then choose which one to show to each member. For example, a romantic comedy might have one image focusing on the romance (to hook fans of romance) and another focusing on a comedic character (to hook fans of comedy) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20Netflix,your%20viewing%20history%20and%20interests)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=surprised%20to%20learn%20the%20image,your%20viewing%20history%20and%20interests)). They use the member’s viewing history to decide which aspect is more relevant. _“Netflix tries to select artwork that highlights the most relevant aspect of a video based on data learned about you”_ ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20Netflix,your%20viewing%20history%20and%20interests)). This is achieved by tracking which types of images a user tends to click on, and A/B testing different artwork. The selection can be done offline (assign each user an image for each title) or at request time (the service picks an image variant when sending the page metadata to the client).

**Page Composition Service:** There is likely a service that assembles the entire set of rows (sometimes called a _page generator_). It takes inputs from various recommendation sources (each source might be an algorithm or a curated list), then decides which rows a user sees (maybe 20 out of 40 possible row types), and which items populate those rows, and in what order. This is highly A/B tested – Netflix might try different page layouts (# of rows, row types) on different user cohorts. The **Experimentation Platform** (discussed later) enables them to test such variations.

**Combining multiple signals:** Netflix’s system architecture for personalization (as noted by their researchers) handles merging signals from:

- **Offline models**: e.g., a matrix factorization giving a score for how much user U might like movie M.
- **Contextual signals (online)**: e.g., time of day (morning vs. night might influence whether to show kids content), device type (on a mobile device, they might emphasize shorter content or downloads), freshness (if a new season of a show you watched was just released, highlight that).
- **Business rules**: ensure a healthy mix (they might have rules like “don’t show more than 3 items from the same series in different rows” to avoid duplication, or “promote Netflix Original content in at least one row” as a strategy).
- **Diversity considerations**: to avoid the filter bubble, sometimes inject some variety or explore new genres the user hasn’t watched.

The heavy-lifting of computing scores is done by the data pipeline, whereas the real-time service just merges and sorts the results, which is relatively fast.

Netflix’s own description of their architecture emphasizes how they manage the combination of offline, nearline, and online computation seamlessly ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=computational%20complexity%20of%20the%20algorithms,Another%20part%20of%20the)) ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=handled%20by%20the%20Event%20and,this%20architecture%20as%20well%20as)). They ensure fresh data is eventually included (nearline updates) while keeping the online serving fast by often using precomputed results with fallbacks.

### 5.3 Search System

Netflix’s search appears simple to the user – you type a few letters and get results – but under the hood it taps into a specialized search infrastructure. As mentioned, Netflix uses **Elasticsearch** to index the catalog ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Elastic%20Search%20,and%20Monitoring)). Here’s how search likely works:

- Netflix maintains an Elasticsearch cluster containing documents for each title (movie/series) and perhaps other entities like actors, genres. These documents contain various fields: title name, genre tags, cast names, plot keywords, etc., possibly boosted by popularity or tailored to the user.
- When a user types a query, the query is sent to a **Search Service**, which likely consults Elasticsearch. The search service could be part of the Discovery API or separate. It might incorporate personalization by boosting titles in the results that align with the user’s profile (for example, if two shows match your query equally, the one in your favorite genre might be ranked higher for you).
- The search uses features like autocomplete and suggestions – those might be powered by a prefix index on ES or by a separate system that caches common search queries and results.
- Netflix’s search results are also influenced by popularity (“Trending Searches”) and by context (they might suggest specific titles vs. genre pages, etc., depending on what the user might be looking for).
- Given that search is a critical function, the search service is probably optimized for low latency – perhaps using in-memory indices or even an EVCache for ultra-fast suggestions. But the main heavy search is likely satisfied by Elasticsearch queries.

The search index must be updated continuously as new content is added or removed. Netflix adds new shows/movies regularly, so their content management system will update the search index when something goes live (or even before, to start showing it in search as “coming on date X”).

### 5.4 Experimentation and A/B Testing

Personalization and search at Netflix are under constant optimization, and Netflix is known for its culture of **A/B testing** everything. This is facilitated by their **Experimentation Platform**, which is an internal service that allows any product or engineering team to define and run experiments on a subset of users ([It's All A/Bout Testing: The Netflix Experimentation Platform](http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/04/its-all-about-testing-netflix.html#:~:text=It%27s%20All%20A%2FBout%20Testing%3A%20The,to%20implement%20their%20A%2FB)). For example, the Personalization team might have a new algorithm to rank content – they can deploy it to, say, 1% of users (randomly chosen) and compare engagement metrics against the control group. The Experimentation Platform handles user allocations, metrics collection, and statistical analysis of results ([It's All A/Bout Testing: The Netflix Experimentation Platform](http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/04/its-all-about-testing-netflix.html#:~:text=It%27s%20All%20A%2FBout%20Testing%3A%20The,to%20implement%20their%20A%2FB)).

From an architectural view, the Experimentation Platform likely integrates as follows:

- The API gateway or a central service determines which _treatment_ a user is in (based on experiment configurations) and tags the request with experiment flags.
- Downstream services (like the recommendation service) check those flags to alter behavior (e.g., use new algorithm vs old).
- All user interactions are logged with experiment metadata (so data analysis can attribute differences to the experiment).
- The platform provides a UI for engineers to set up experiments (choose target population size, duration, success metrics, etc.) ([It's All A/Bout Testing: The Netflix Experimentation Platform](http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/04/its-all-about-testing-netflix.html#:~:text=It%27s%20All%20A%2FBout%20Testing%3A%20The,to%20implement%20their%20A%2FB)).

One can imagine that at any given time, Netflix has dozens of concurrent experiments – different UI layouts, different recommendation logic, different playback UI features, etc. The platform and culture ensure that changes are data-driven. If an experiment shows a statistically significant improvement (for example, higher retention or more hours watched due to a new recommendation model), then Netflix rolls it out to everyone.

A concrete example: Netflix tested reducing the 5-star rating system to a simpler thumbs-up/down in 2017; they ran experiments that showed this change increased user rating participation (which in turn helps their algorithms) ([Innovating Faster on Personalization Algorithms at Netflix Using ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7iu5k0/innovating_faster_on_personalization_algorithms/#:~:text=Innovating%20Faster%20on%20Personalization%20Algorithms,review%20of%20the%20work%27)). After confirming via A/B test, they rolled out globally.

### 5.5 Netflix Research and Continuous Improvement

Netflix has an in-house research team (Netflix Research) that works on recommender systems and publishes papers. They treat the recommendation and personalization problem as ongoing R&D. For instance, they explore reinforcement learning for page optimization, contextual bandits for personalizing artwork selection, or graph algorithms for content similarity. These advanced techniques eventually translate to production if they prove beneficial.

The architecture is flexible enough to incorporate new algorithms – e.g., swapping out the module that generates candidate lists, or adding a post-processing step in the ranking pipeline. Thanks to microservices, a new recommendation algorithm can often be deployed as a new service or an updated service without affecting the rest of the system, and then ramped up via the experimentation framework.

In summary, Netflix’s personalization and search systems sit on top of their robust data infrastructure and leverage both batch and real-time components. They are designed not as static one-time solutions but as **continuous learning systems** – constantly ingesting new data and trying new algorithms, with success measured by user engagement. This is all made possible by the integration of data pipelines, scalable serving architecture, and a culture of experimentation.

Having covered how Netflix gets content to the user (the control plane and data intelligence), let’s now discuss the other side of the coin: how the content (video) actually gets delivered efficiently to the user’s device when they hit play, including the streaming protocols, video encoding, and the special role of the Open Connect CDN.

## 6. Video Pipeline: Encoding, CDN (Open Connect), and Playback Architecture

When a user clicks “Play” on a Netflix title, a complex chain of events is triggered to deliver video to that user with the highest possible quality and reliability. This chain involves Netflix’s content processing pipeline (which prepares video files in many formats), its Content Delivery Network (Open Connect, which stores and serves those files), and the client playback application (which requests segments, adapts bitrate, and handles DRM decryption). In this section, we will walk through the architecture of Netflix’s video pipeline: from **encoding/transcoding** of content, through distribution via **Open Connect**, to the **playback architecture** on the client including **adaptive streaming** and **DRM**.

### 6.1 Content Ingestion and Transcoding Pipeline

**Content Ingestion:** Netflix receives original video files (the “mezzanine” files) from studios and content partners at very high quality – these could be huge RAW video files or professional mezzanine formats (like a 4K master at very high bitrate) ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=Netflix%20has%20a%20combined%20library,These%20preprocessing)) ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=to%20serve%20that%20many%20devices,These%20preprocessing)). A typical 2-hour movie master can be tens of gigabytes in size ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=to%20serve%20that%20many%20devices,These%20preprocessing)). These are not practical for streaming directly, so Netflix preprocesses every piece of content through an **encoding pipeline**. The pipeline is sometimes referred to as the “Netflix Encoding Farm” which runs on AWS.

**Transcoding and Encoding:** The terms are defined as:

- _Encoding_ – compressing raw video into a target format (codec) for a single device or profile.
- _Transcoding_ – converting already encoded video into other encodings (often used interchangeably with encoding in practice) ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=are%20referred%20to%20as%20Encoding,and%20Transcoding)).

Netflix’s pipeline creates multiple encoded versions of each title to support different **devices, screen resolutions, and network qualities** ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=Netflix%20has%20a%20combined%20library,These%20preprocessing)). For example, a single movie might be encoded in:

- Several codecs: H.264/AVC (widely supported), H.265/HEVC (newer devices, more efficient), VP9 (for certain platforms), and AV1 (the newest, which Netflix started using for mobile to save bandwidth).
- Multiple resolutions: 2160p (4K), 1080p, 720p, 480p, etc.
- Multiple bitrate levels for each resolution (to allow adaptive streaming – more on that soon).

Netflix’s system can produce **1000+ different video files for one piece of content** to cover all combinations. In fact, Netflix stated they create approximately _“1100-1200 replicas for the same movie”_, across different formats and resolutions. This sounds enormous, but it includes all audio/subtitle combinations, all video quality levels, etc.

How do they do this efficiently? They leverage cloud parallelism:

- The original file is **split into chunks** (Netflix breaks the movie into small segments, a few minutes or seconds each).
- They spin up many workers on AWS EC2 (dozens or hundreds of encoding instances) to encode chunks in parallel. Each worker might take a chunk and produce various versions of that chunk (say a 1080p@2Mbps segment, a 480p@500kbps segment, etc.).
- By processing in parallel, the job that might take many hours on one machine can be done much faster. Netflix likely uses an orchestrator to manage encoding jobs (perhaps AWS Batch or a custom system).
- After encoding, the chunks are reassembled by type – basically, they produce sets of media files: for example, a complete set of 4K segments for movie X at bitrate Y, another set for 1080p, etc.

Netflix also applies **quality control** and optimization:

- They detect errors in the video (glitches, etc.) during preprocessing ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=are%20referred%20to%20as%20Encoding,and%20Transcoding)).
- They use metrics like **VMAF (Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion)**, a quality metric Netflix developed, to ensure encodes are optimal – adjusting bitrates so that perceptual quality is maximized at minimal file size. Netflix pioneered “**Per-Title Encoding**” where the bitrates chosen for each resolution are tuned per content complexity. For example, an animated show might achieve good quality at lower bitrate than a live-action with grainy dark scenes, so they adjust encoding settings accordingly.
- Newer technique: **Per-Shot Encoding** – Netflix divides content by scene (shot) and can encode each scene with different parameters for efficiency.

Encoded video and audio files are stored on **Amazon S3** (Netflix’s “media repository” in the cloud). At this point, we have all the needed files to stream the content.

**Packaging and DRM:** Netflix packages video into segments typically in **MPEG-DASH** or **HLS** format (both are adaptive streaming protocols). They create manifests that list all the segments and bitrates. Netflix applies **encryption** to these files – each video is encrypted with keys corresponding to DRM systems (Widevine, PlayReady, FairPlay). The files on S3 and later on CDN are encrypted; only licensed clients can decrypt. Netflix might encrypt during encoding or right after (either way, before it reaches the CDN). The important piece is that for each title, keys are generated and those keys are stored by Netflix’s **License Service** (part of their DRM infrastructure, discussed later).

At the end of this pipeline, Netflix has:

- Multiple encrypted segment files for each combination of bitrate/resolution for each title.
- These are in S3, ready to be deployed to CDN.

**Efficiency note:** This pipeline is compute-intensive, but Netflix’s usage of AWS allows it to scale as needed. They can throw more instances for big batches (like preparing an entire season of a show overnight). They also schedule these tasks smartly – e.g., **non-real-time**: a show that premieres next week can be encoded days in advance. And for their own originals, they integrate this into the post-production workflow so that masters go through this pipeline well before release.

### 6.2 Netflix Open Connect – The Custom CDN

Netflix’s video files then get distributed via **Open Connect**, which is Netflix’s global content delivery network. Unlike most streaming services that pay third-party CDNs (like Akamai or CloudFront), Netflix built and manages its own CDN to have greater control and reduce cost at their scale.

**Open Connect Appliances (OCAs):** These are essentially high-powered cache servers that Netflix provides to ISPs. An OCA is a server box loaded with storage (many terabytes of SSDs/HDDs) and network interfaces. They run Netflix caching software (likely a variant of Nginx or specialized HTTP cache) that stores Netflix video content and serves it to local users. One OCA can store a portion of the Netflix catalog (280 TB of data on a typical OCA, according to Netflix ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=declines%20in%20revenue%2C%20it%20is,You%20could))). Popular content will be stored on almost all OCAs, while less popular niche content might only be on regional OCAs or fetched on demand if needed.

**OCA Deployment:** Netflix deploys OCAs at:

- **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs):** these are facilities where many networks meet and exchange traffic. Netflix places OCAs at IXPs so that many ISP networks can reach them with minimal latency.
- **ISPs’ networks:** Netflix partners directly with ISPs to place OCAs in their data centers (inside the ISP’s network). This way, when the ISP’s customers stream Netflix, the traffic is served internally from those OCAs, not over the ISP’s costly transit links ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=,metrics%20optimal%20routes%20they%20learned)). Over 1000 ISPs globally have Netflix OCAs.

OCAs are provided free to qualifying ISPs (who have enough Netflix traffic) – it benefits the ISP by saving bandwidth on their external connections, and benefits Netflix by ensuring better quality to end-users and saving on paying transit bandwidth. This win-win model helped Netflix scale out Open Connect widely.

**Content Placement and Updates:** How do videos get onto the OCAs? Netflix uses a variety of content placement algorithms:

- **Popularity-based Caching:** OCAs automatically cache content that is requested. If a user in an ISP requests a movie that’s not on the local OCA, the OCA can fetch it from an upstream node (like an OCA at a larger regional hub or ultimately from Netflix’s origin in AWS) – this is similar to how normal HTTP caching works (miss and fill).
- **Proactive Pre-Population:** Netflix also proactively fills OCAs with content before it is requested, especially new releases. They know, for example, a new season of a popular show will drop at midnight – Netflix will push those episodes to OCAs serving regions where it’s about to be midnight, to avoid many simultaneous origin fetches. They do this in off-peak hours to avoid congestion ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=IXP,content%20is%20served%20this%20way)) ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=Connect%20Control%20Plane%20services%20on,other%27s%20IP%20address%2C%20the%20OCAs)).
- **Global Traffic Predictability:** Netflix has enough data to predict viewing patterns. They know which shows are popular in which regions. Their control plane likely computes a weekly (or daily) content distribution plan: e.g., “Place movie X on all OCAs in North America, but only on regional OCAs in Asia where it’s less popular.” They might replicate content hierarchically: store everything on some core OCAs, regionally filter to the rest.
- **Cache eviction:** Since OCAs have finite storage, less popular content is evicted over time to make room for new or popular content. If evicted content is requested, the OCA can fetch it from another cache. Netflix likely differentiates between an **ISP site** (within ISP, multiple OCAs) and **IXP site** (which might serve multiple ISPs). There is a concept of _cache clusters_ where multiple OCAs at the same site might share load or content.

**Control Plane Integration:** Netflix’s AWS control plane has a component for controlling Open Connect. OCAs **report their status** back to Netflix AWS – e.g., what content they have, their load, etc. ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=,OCAs%20servers%20within%20the%20same)). Netflix’s control services (sometimes called the “Open Connect control plane”) aggregate this info. When a user hits play, the **Playback service** in AWS uses these reports to decide _which OCA_ should serve the user ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=1,back%20to%20the%20playback%20service)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=2,video%20files%20from%20that%20OCA)). This decision (often called “steering”) is influenced by:

- The user’s IP/network (to guess which ISP or region they’re in, hence which OCA is nearest).
- The availability of the content on that OCA (does the OCA have the video in the needed format?).
- The OCA health and load (it might avoid an OCA if it’s near capacity or currently failing).

Netflix runs a **Steering service** (also referred to as “CDN selector” or by codename “CODA” as seen in diagrams). This service picks the best OCA for a session ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=3,video%20files%20from%20that%20OCA)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=into%20account%20the%20current%20network,video%20files%20from%20that%20OCA)). They also have a **Cache Control Service (CCS)** that monitors and instructs caches – for example, to fill certain content.

**Multi-tier Content Filling:** Netflix described _cache fill, peer fill, and tiered fill_ among OCAs ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=Connect%20Control%20Plane%20services%20on,other%27s%20IP%20address%2C%20the%20OCAs)):

- **Cache fill:** an OCA at an IXP or major site might fill content directly from origin (S3/AWS) – that’s a cache fill.
- **Peer fill:** within the same ISP site, one OCA can fetch from another if it has the content (like OCA #2 pulling from OCA #1 in ISP Site #1).
- **Tiered fill:** between sites, Netflix can designate certain OCAs as parents for others. E.g., an IXP site might serve as a primary source for smaller ISP sites. If ISP Site #2’s OCA doesn’t have a movie, it can fetch from ISP Site #1’s OCA (tier fill) which might have it, rather than going all the way to origin. This reduces duplicate traffic from origin.

**When User Hits Play (Detailed):** Let’s integrate how it works when you press play:

1. **Playback Request:** Your device sends a “play” request to Netflix’s Play API (in AWS) including which title and your account info.
2. **Authentication & Authorization:** The Play service checks you have rights (e.g., parental controls, account active, content available in your region) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=2,video%20files%20from%20that%20OCA)).
3. **Manifest Generation:** The Playback service decides which video profile you should get. It likely prepares a manifest file listing the URLs for video segments. Netflix’s video URLs point to hostnames that resolve to the OCA. E.g., a URL might look like `http://ipv4_1-lagg0-c000.oma.nflxvideo.net/.../range/...?nobid=...` – where `oma` might hint at a location (Omaha) OCA. Netflix encodes in the URL or via DNS which OCA cluster to use.
4. **Choosing an OCA:** This is done by the Steering service (which the Playback service consults). Based on your IP, it finds the nearest OCAs and knows which have the content. It picks an OCA (or possibly two for redundancy) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=3,video%20files%20from%20that%20OCA)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=into%20account%20the%20current%20network,video%20files%20from%20that%20OCA)). It then generates URLs for the video segments on that OCA ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=3,video%20files%20from%20that%20OCA)). These URLs are returned to the client as part of the “Playback Context” (manifest) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=To%20play%20a%20title%2C%20the,license%20is%20then%20used%20to)) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=data%20such%20as%20the%20image,case%2C%20the%20license%20is%20short)). Essentially, the client gets a manifest saying “here are the video chunk URLs, hosted at [OCA address].”
5. **License Acquisition:** In parallel, the client contacts Netflix’s License Service to get a DRM license (we’ll detail DRM in next subsection). The license request goes to AWS, which checks entitlements and issues a decryption key tied to the device.
6. **Client Connects to OCA:** Now the client begins streaming. It resolves the OCA hostname to an IP (via DNS). Netflix likely uses DNS-based load balancing to direct the client to a specific OCA or cluster. Once resolved, the client’s video player will start fetching segments (small files, often 1–4 seconds of video each) from the OCA via HTTP(S).
7. **Video Streaming with Adaptation:** The client will initially request a relatively low-bitrate segment to start quickly (to avoid long buffering). It measures the download speed and if it’s fast, the client requests the next segment at a higher quality, and so forth. This **Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)** algorithm runs continuously: if the network slows (maybe WiFi signal drops), the client will request a lower bitrate chunk next time to avoid buffering. Netflix uses standard ABR protocols (DASH or HLS) where the manifest provides multiple bitrates.
8. **OCA Delivers Segments:** The OCA, being basically a web server with the content cached on SSD, delivers the chunks to the client. If for some reason a chunk isn’t on that OCA (rare if the steering was correct), the OCA could either fetch it or the client might fallback to another URL (Netflix can provide backup URLs in the manifest, e.g., a generic CDN location).
9. **Playback Experience:** The user sees the video start. They might notice it start in lower quality (slightly pixelated) and then sharpen – that’s the ABR stepping up to HD/UHD once it confirms the bandwidth is sufficient. Netflix’s player also buffers ahead a few segments to handle variability.
10. **Ongoing telemetry:** The client continuously sends “heartbeat” or “progress” events (often called “beacons”) back to Netflix – telling how the buffering is, what bitrate is being used, etc. This helps Netflix monitor quality of experience across regions and also feeds the algorithm if adaptation is needed. The `Beacon` service and `ViewingHistory` service record these events via Kafka ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Image%3A%20streaming)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=The%20Viewing%20History%20Service%20captures,services%20is%20sent%20to%20Kafka)).

This might sound complicated, but it happens in seconds and is seamless to the user. Figure 6 summarizes the interaction between AWS and Open Connect during playback:

([image]()) _Figure 6: Netflix playback request flow ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=1,back%20to%20the%20playback%20service)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=3,video%20files%20from%20that%20OCA)). **(1)** OCAs (Open Connect Appliances) continually report their status (health, routes, cached content) to Netflix’s control services (CCS) in AWS ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Open%20Connect%20Design%20Image)). **(2)** A user presses “Play” on their device, sending a request to Netflix’s cloud. **(3)** Netflix’s Playback service determines what files are needed (based on device capabilities, available network speed). **(4)** The Steering Service (CODA) picks the optimal OCA(s) for the user and content ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=3,video%20files%20from%20that%20OCA)). **(5)** Netflix returns to the client the URLs of the video segments on that OCA ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=into%20account%20the%20current%20network,video%20files%20from%20that%20OCA)), and the client then requests those files directly from the OCA. **(6)** The OCA serves the video files to the client over HTTP. This process ensures the video is delivered from as close to the user as possible, reducing startup time and improving streaming quality._

Netflix’s CDN is highly effective: by serving content locally, they can handle huge volumes (like a popular show release) largely within ISP networks. It’s reported that Netflix can deliver over 100 Tbps of traffic globally during peaks thanks to Open Connect.

Open Connect also has special software features – for instance, they might use **application-level multicast** for very popular live events (if Netflix were to do live streaming, which they’ve started experimenting with). But primarily, it’s VOD caching.

Now, we’ve covered how the content gets to the client. The last piece is the **client playback architecture**, especially the DRM and offline support.

### 6.3 DRM and Content Protection

Netflix must enforce content licenses – ensuring that video can only be accessed by authorized users and cannot be (easily) pirated. This is accomplished with **Digital Rights Management (DRM)** technology. Netflix uses multiple DRM systems to cover different platforms:

- **Widevine** (by Google) – used in Android, Chrome browser, and many smart TVs.
- **PlayReady** (by Microsoft) – used in Windows apps, Edge/IE browsers, some smart TVs, Xbox, etc.
- **FairPlay** (by Apple) – used in iOS/tvOS apps and Safari browser.
  There may be others or custom ones for specific devices, but these are the main three. Netflix’s system abstracts these via its **Playback Licensing** microservices ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=For%20the%20Playback%20Licensing%20team%2C,our%20existing%20systems%20were%20stateless)) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=To%20play%20a%20title%2C%20the,license%20is%20then%20used%20to)).

Here’s how DRM works in Netflix:

- All video files are encrypted with strong ciphers (e.g., AES-128 or AES-256) before being stored on the CDN. Each title will have one or more **encryption keys**. Typically, they might use one key per title or per set of segments.
- These keys are stored in Netflix’s secure licensing service databases (not on the client or CDN).
- When a user wants to play a video, the client must obtain a **license (decryption key)** from Netflix’s license server. This is usually a separate request that happens at playback start. The client (which has a DRM agent, like the Widevine CDM on Android or the PlayReady DRM component on Windows) communicates with Netflix’s license service, presenting some form of token proving the user is entitled to the content.
- Netflix’s Playback Licensing service checks a bunch of things – is this account allowed to watch this title (e.g., not out of region, parental control OK, stream limit not exceeded)? Also, it checks the device’s DRM security level (for example, some content like 4K requires the device to have HDCP 2.2 and a secure video path, etc.). If all good, it issues a license which contains the decryption key(s), often wrapped in the DRM platform’s encryption.
- The client’s DRM component receives the license, decrypts it (the DRM system ensures this happens in a secure hardware-backed or software-secure environment), and obtains the content key. This key never leaves the DRM subsystem in plaintext – it’s stored in secure memory.
- When the encrypted video segments arrive from the CDN, the DRM component decrypts the video on the fly so it can be decoded and played. The decrypted data stays in memory and is immediately fed to the video decoder; it’s not accessible to normal application code or the file system, preventing easy copying of raw video.
- The license typically has policies: for streaming, it might be a **“single-play” license** meaning once playback is done, the license is discarded (so you’d need to fetch a new one if you play again) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=for%20an%20excellent%20overview%20of,to%20be%20used%20for%20playback)) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=,to%20be%20used%20for%20playback)). This limits the window of decryption to the viewing session.
- If a user tries to use a screen-capture or an insecure output, the DRM can enforce blocks (like blacking out video if an unauthorized capture is attempted – often done via OS or hardware).

Netflix’s license services are separate per DRM: they have a service for Widevine, one for PlayReady, etc., because each DRM has its own protocol ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=request%20a%20license%20for%20a,to%20be%20used%20for%20playback)). But there’s a common layer they built to handle business logic.

Netflix had to build new systems to support **offline downloads** (which they introduced in 2016) because traditionally their licenses were short-lived and one-time-use ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=To%20play%20a%20title%2C%20the,license%20is%20then%20used%20to)). For offline, the license needs to be usable for a longer period (e.g., a few days) and allow viewing multiple times without network. Netflix’s solution:

- They created a new service (stateful) to handle download licenses and enforce limits ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=The%20downloads%20flow%20differs%20slightly,Metadata%29%20for%20the%20downloaded)) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=The%20license%20used%20for%20downloaded,different%20from%20streaming%20%E2%80%94%20it)).
- When you download a title, the app contacts the license service in “download mode”. Netflix checks additional rules: e.g., some titles may not be allowed for download (due to studio rights), or there may be limits like “you can only download X titles at once” or “title expires 48 hours after you start watching if offline” ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=best%20content%20for%20our%20members,number%20of%20downloads%20for%20a)) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=studios,number%20of%20downloads%20for%20a)). These rules vary by content – Netflix mentioned they have to enforce various studio-imposed constraints (like number of devices that can have a download, total downloads per year, etc.) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=match%20at%20L157%20best%20content,number%20of%20downloads%20for%20a)) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=best%20content%20for%20our%20members,number%20of%20downloads%20for%20a)).
- If allowed, Netflix issues a **download license**. This license is stored on the user’s device (within the DRM system’s secure storage). It contains keys to decrypt the content and usually an expiration timestamp and usage count.
- The video is downloaded encrypted (same files from CDN, just saved to disk). The license on device allows the DRM to decrypt it for playback offline. The license might allow say “play this content as many times as you want for 7 days, then it expires” – or “once you hit play, you have 48 hours to finish watching, then license expires” (common patterns).
- The Netflix app will refuse to play a downloaded title if the license has expired or if the app detects tampering. If online, it might attempt to renew the license (if allowed, Netflix will contact server to extend).
- Netflix’s backend for offline keeps track of how many times each license was renewed, how many devices have it, etc., to enforce limits ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=can%20be%20downloaded%20or%20watched,a%20specified%20period%20of%20time)) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=Netflix%20member%20downloads,for%20the%20partner%2C%20taking%20into)). They used an event sourcing approach to reliably track these counts, given the complexity of sync when devices come online/offline ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=match%20at%20L141%20Once%20the,has%20a%20lifecycle%20as%20follows)) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=for%20each%20title%20however%2C%20the,the%20business%20rules%20for%20downloads)).
- If a user or Netflix deletes a download (say the title left the service), the app will delete the local file and license.

So Netflix’s **Playback License Architecture** consists of:

- **License services** (microservices in AWS) for each DRM, issuing licenses and maintaining a database of issued offline licenses.
- **Keys database** (secure store of all content keys).
- **Device eligibility system** – ensures device meets security requirements (some older or rooted devices might be denied HD or playback at all).
- For streaming, these services are stateless (every request independent). For offline, they built a **stateful system** since it needs to remember what’s been issued ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=downloaded%20content%20for%20offline%20viewing,our%20existing%20systems%20were%20stateless)) ([Scaling Event Sourcing for Netflix Downloads, Episode 1 | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-event-sourcing-for-netflix-downloads-episode-1-6bc1595c5595#:~:text=with%20a%20new%20API%20for,our%20existing%20systems%20were%20stateless)). They moved to event sourcing to handle large scale state changes (millions of download events).

In practice, the user doesn’t see DRM – it’s under the hood. But if you’ve ever encountered “Too many devices” or “Download limit reached” on Netflix, that’s the manifestation of these rules.

**Adaptive Bitrate (ABR):** We touched on it but to clarify: Netflix uses ABR streaming to handle varying network speeds. The player monitors buffer and throughput; if the buffer starts to run low or throughput drops, it will switch to a lower bitrate stream to avoid a stall. Conversely, if there’s headroom, it will go higher. Netflix has very advanced ABR algorithms – they even simulate networks to fine-tune how aggressive the switching is. The ABR is implemented in the client application. The server side (OCA) just provides all the bitrates; the client chooses which to request next.

**Multi-CDN fallback:** In the rare case an OCA is unreachable (maybe a network issue), Netflix can fallback to other CDN paths. They might have a secondary domain that goes to a different location or even to a third-party CDN as backup. They try to avoid that as Open Connect is optimal, but the client does have logic to handle failures by attempting alternate URLs if provided.

**Player Software:** Each Netflix client has a built-in “Netflix Player” component. On some platforms (like PC browsers), they use the browser’s capabilities (Media Source Extensions and EME for DRM). On custom devices (smart TVs, consoles), Netflix provides a software development kit (SDK) that device manufacturers integrate, which handles streaming, DRM, UI, etc. This SDK is tailored to each platform’s hardware. The architecture ensures consistency of experience across devices, even though under the hood each might use a different DRM or streaming tech.

**Telemetry & QoS:** Netflix continuously monitors playback quality metrics like bitrate chosen, buffer underruns, crashes, etc. They feed this into their operations (e.g., to trigger scaling if a particular region’s users are buffering due to overloaded OCA, or to alert if a new app version is causing issues).

### 6.4 Putting It Together: End-to-End Example

To illustrate end-to-end: imagine a new Netflix Original movie is released:

- Weeks before release: Netflix’s studio team delivers the final cut to Netflix’s encoding pipeline. The video is encoded into dozens of streams, encryption keys are generated and stored. Files are on S3.
- Days before release: Netflix’s Open Connect control prepositions the content on OCAs worldwide during off-peak hours (cache fill). OCAs at ISP caches fetch the files from regional peers or origin.
- Release moment: User opens Netflix, sees the new movie highlighted (personalization knows this is a big title).
- User hits play. In milliseconds: Auth check done, license request sent and granted (with a streaming license). The system picks a local OCA. The manifest with URLs is given to the app.
- The app starts pulling video from the OCA – initial chunk arrives, movie starts in SD, then ramps to HD or 4K in a few seconds. The user enjoys the movie without buffering.
- As they watch, their device is sending viewing metrics and at the end, a “view complete” event updates their profile (so Netflix knows they watched that movie, affecting future recs).
- The next day, the user goes offline on a flight after downloading some episodes of a show. They play them offline; the app’s DRM uses the stored license to decrypt. The app records offline viewing events to sync later (to update “watched” status when back online).
- Meanwhile, Netflix’s systems gather aggregate data – how many watched that movie, did any buffer issues occur – to analyze content performance and network health. The recommendation system will incorporate the data that “User watched Movie X” into generating what to suggest next.

This entire chain – from studio to viewer – is managed by Netflix’s end-to-end architecture with remarkable automation and minimal human intervention. The combination of cloud services and edge network is what enables Netflix to stream billions of hours reliably ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Netflix%20accounts%20for%20about%2015,problems%20exist%20to%20be%20solved)).

Having examined the technical architecture of both the control plane (microservices, data, personalization) and the data plane (CDN and playback), we now turn to how Netflix ensures all of this runs smoothly in practice. This involves the practices of DevOps, automation, monitoring, and chaos engineering that Netflix uses to manage its massive infrastructure.

## 7. DevOps, CI/CD, and Infrastructure Management at Netflix

Netflix’s ability to deliver new features and handle massive traffic is strongly tied to its engineering practices and internal platforms. They have embraced a DevOps philosophy (“**You build it, you run it**”) where development teams are responsible for the operation of their services in production. To support this, Netflix invested heavily in tooling for continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure automation. In this section, we look at how Netflix builds, tests, and deploys code at scale, including the use of their **Titus container platform**, the **Spinnaker CD tool**, and Infrastructure-as-Code principles.

### 7.1 Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)

**Code Integration:** Netflix engineers work in a fast-paced environment where code changes are integrated frequently. They likely use standard CI practices: each code repository has automated tests that run on every commit or pull request. Netflix has talked about moving towards **Microsite** or **Scinnaker** for build automation in the past (though details are less public). They definitely rely on automated testing at unit and integration level to ensure changes don’t break core functionality.

**Deployment Pipeline:** Netflix pioneered automated canary and deployment techniques:

- Netflix’s deployment pipeline is largely orchestrated by **Spinnaker**, an open-source multi-cloud continuous delivery platform that Netflix started (in collaboration with Google and others) ([Chaos Monkey at Netflix: the Origin of Chaos Engineering - Gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com/chaos-monkey/the-origin-of-chaos-monkey#:~:text=Chaos%20Monkey%20at%20Netflix%3A%20the,systems%20to%20improve%20their%20resilience)). Spinnaker allows Netflix teams to define pipelines that include steps like bake an AMI or build a Docker image, run integration tests, deploy to test environment, run a canary analysis, then gradually deploy to production.
- **Baking AMIs**: Historically, Netflix deployed services by creating an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with the service and all dependencies, then using that to launch EC2 instances (immutable infrastructure). They automated the creation of these AMIs for each version. This concept of baking ensures the deployment is reproducible and quick to instantiate.
- **Canary Analysis**: Netflix integrated automated checks when a new version is deployed to a small subset (the canary). They compare metrics from the canary instances vs baseline instances running the old version. They have a tool (Kayenta) to do statistical analysis on KPIs (error rate, CPU, etc.). If the canary shows regressions, Spinnaker can halt or rollback the deployment ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=,1%20million%20requests%20per%20second)).
- **Automated Rollout**: If canaries pass, Spinnaker proceeds to push the new version to all instances. Thanks to the red/black (blue/green) strategy, this can be done with no downtime. If any issue is detected mid-deploy (alerts triggered, etc.), they can quickly rollback to the previous version (since those instances are still running until fully cut over).

**Multiple Deployments per Day:** Netflix has hundreds of teams deploying microservices. It’s not uncommon that Netflix has dozens of deployments in a day ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=This%20article%20analyzes%20the%20Netflix,system%20design%20for%20engineers%20course)). The pipeline’s automation means engineers can deploy on their own schedule without central coordination.

**Infrastructure as Code:** Netflix likely employs infrastructure-as-code for consistent environment setup. While they don’t publicly mention using Terraform or CloudFormation, they certainly script their AWS infrastructure. They had a tool called **Asgard** in the past to manage AWS (pre-dating Terraform). Today, Spinnaker covers a lot of that by creating AWS resources via its cloud driver. Teams can define their clusters, scaling policies, etc., in version-controlled config (Spinnaker pipelines as code).

Netflix also manages configuration changes via tools. They use **Archaius** (a dynamic configuration library) that pulls configuration from a centralized source so that things can be toggled on/off without redeploy ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=In%20any%20distributed%20environment%20,tolerance%20and%20fault%20tolerance%20logic)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=they%20can%20go%20to%2C%20and,of%20the%20first%20circuit%20breaking)). Feature flags are common, and those are likely managed via centralized config or an internal feature flagging service.

**Testing in Production:** Netflix is known to shift some testing to production environment using controlled rollouts. Because of their scale, staging environments may not catch everything that happens under real user patterns. So they rely on canaries and gradually increasing user exposure to validate changes.

### 7.2 Container Orchestration with Titus

As mentioned earlier, Netflix operates Titus, their container management platform. Let’s detail how Titus fits in:

- **Microservices on Titus:** Many Netflix services now run as Docker containers on top of Titus. For the dev team, this means they define a Docker image for their service (with a base runtime, their code, etc.). Spinnaker’s pipeline can build that Docker image and then tell Titus to deploy, say, 50 containers of it across the cluster.
- **Resource Scheduling:** Titus, using Apache Mesos under the hood (at least originally), maintains a cluster of EC2 instances and can pack multiple containers per instance. It handles bin-packing (optimizing CPU/memory usage) better than the old 1 service per instance model. Titus integrates with AWS so that if the cluster needs more capacity (for a big batch job or a scaling microservice), it can spin up more EC2 instances.
- **Batch and Service Workloads:** Titus is used for both long-running services and short-lived batch jobs ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20framework%20on,the%20Netflix%20version%20of%20Kubernetes)). For example, encoding jobs (video transcoding) may run on Titus as batch containers; and the API services may also run as continuously running containers. Titus ensures isolation and security among containers, and provides common utilities (logging agents, metrics).
- **Integration**: Titus ties into Netflix’s service discovery (Eureka). When a container comes up, Titus automatically registers it in Eureka under the appropriate service name, so it starts receiving traffic. Titus also works with Spinnaker for deployment and with Atlas (Netflix’s metrics system) for monitoring.

By using Titus, Netflix achieved higher efficiency (3 million containers/week launched suggests a lot of ephemeral tasks, which would be too many individual VMs otherwise) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Titus%20is%20run%20in%20production,the%20Netflix%20version%20of%20Kubernetes)). It’s essentially Netflix’s internal “PaaS” akin to a custom Kubernetes. They did not adopt Kubernetes (likely because Titus predates K8s maturity and was tailored to Netflix needs), but Titus provides similar functionality within AWS.

### 7.3 Observability: Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing

Operating such a complex system requires excellent observability:

- **Metrics (Monitoring):** Netflix built **Atlas**, an in-house telemetry platform for monitoring time-series data (CPU, memory, custom app metrics). Atlas agents run on instances collecting metrics and forward to a central service for storage and analysis. Netflix engineers create dashboards and set alerts on metrics like request rates, error percentages, latency percentiles, etc. For instance, if error rate on the Play### 7.3 Observability and Monitoring

Netflix’s operations generate an immense amount of telemetry, and they have built a comprehensive **observability stack** to monitor system health in real time and diagnose issues. Key components include monitoring of metrics, distributed logging, and tracing:

- **Metrics and Dashboards:** Netflix uses a custom metrics system called **Atlas** (open-sourced by Netflix) to collect and query time-series metrics. Every microservice and infrastructure component emits metrics (e.g., request rates, latencies, error counts, JVM GC times, etc.) which are tagged and stored in a scalable datastore. Engineers create real-time dashboards to visualize these metrics and set up automated alerts. For example, if the error rate of the Play API rises above a threshold or if CPU usage on an instance goes too high, Atlas triggers alerts that notify on-call engineers. The culture is to catch issues early – often the automated canary analysis (in Spinnaker) uses these metrics to decide if a new deployment is healthy ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=service)).

- **Logging:** Each service produces log events (for instance, a log of each API request with details, or application debug logs). Netflix aggregates logs in a central system for analysis. They have used tools like Elasticsearch for indexing logs ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Elastic%20Search%20,and%20Monitoring)), enabling engineers to search through logs of distributed systems when troubleshooting. For example, if a specific user request failed, they might search logs across several services using a correlation ID. Netflix’s logging infrastructure likely involves shipping logs from instances (using agents or Kafka) to an indexing cluster or data lake. Because logs can be huge (Netflix services process billions of requests), they can’t ship everything synchronously – they rely on asynchronous aggregation (through Kafka/Chukwa into S3, as noted in Section 4) and then query tools on top of that data. In practice, engineers might use Kibana or a similar UI to filter logs by service, time, error codes, etc., to pinpoint issues. They also use logs for **error detection** – e.g., feeding them into Elasticsearch allows real-time monitoring of certain error keywords ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Elastic%20Search%20,and%20Monitoring)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Netflix%20uses%20elastic%20search%20for,error%20detection%20in%20the%20system)).

- **Distributed Tracing:** In a microservices environment, one user action may involve calls to dozens of services. Netflix has implemented distributed tracing to follow these call chains. They pass a unique trace ID through request headers from the API gateway down through all microservice calls. Each service logs the trace ID with its events. This way, if a user action is slow or fails, engineers can pull logs for that trace ID from all involved services to see where the bottleneck was. Netflix’s engineering has mentioned this approach of correlating events ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=architecture%20describes%20how%20the%20different,our%20whole%20infrastructure%20runs%20across)). While Netflix did not open-source a tool like Zipkin (which came from Twitter/Finagle), they likely have an internal trace visualization system. It might show a timeline of how long each service took to respond for a given request, helping to identify slow components.

- **Alerting and Auto-Remediation:** Alerts are configured for all critical metrics (latency, error rate, etc.). Netflix favors automated responses where possible. For example, if one instance shows degraded performance, the auto-scaling or self-healing systems (like Chaos Monkey’s companion “Doctor Monkey”) might remove or replace it. They also have _auto rollback_ – if a new deployment triggers alerts, Spinnaker can automatically rollback to the previous version. Humans are on-call, but the goal is that the system handles common issues without waking people up at 3am. That said, for novel or complex failures, Netflix on-calls have detailed runbooks and tools to quickly inspect the health of the entire service ecosystem (e.g., global dashboards that show key metrics by region and service cluster).

- **User Experience Monitoring:** Netflix not only monitors server-side metrics but also client-side QoS. Each Netflix app periodically sends metrics like “buffering event occurred” or “playback stalled” back to Netflix (via the Beacon service). Netflix aggregates these to monitor streaming quality across ISPs and regions in real time. For instance, if an ISP has an outage or congestion, Netflix’s NOC (Network Operations Center) dashboard will light up showing a spike in buffering or drop in bitrate for users of that ISP. This can trigger Netflix to divert traffic (if possible) or alert the ISP. Netflix publishes an ISP Speed Index based on the data they gather. Internally, this data is critical to ensure Open Connect is functioning – if one OCA cluster is underperforming, user QoS metrics will reflect that, prompting investigation.

- **Chaos Automation (as Monitoring):** Interestingly, Netflix’s **Chaos Monkey** (discussed below) can be seen as part of observability. By intentionally terminating instances, they test whether their monitoring alerts correctly detect issues and whether systems automatically recover. It’s a proactive way to ensure the observability and auto-healing are effective.

The combination of Atlas for metrics, centralized logging, and tracing gives Netflix what is often called **“full visibility”** into their production system. It’s often said that at Netflix every significant user event is measured and can be visualized. This data-driven operations approach allows Netflix to maintain reliability even as they push code frequently and run on complex infrastructure.

### 8. Chaos Engineering and Resilience Practices

Netflix is famously the pioneer of **Chaos Engineering** – the discipline of testing a system’s resilience by injecting failures in production. The goal is to ensure that the inevitable failures (of servers, network, dependencies) do not derail the overall service, by proactively hardening the system and training engineers to respond. Netflix’s tools and practices in this area include:

- **Chaos Monkey:** A tool that randomly terminates instances (VMs or containers) in production to verify that services can survive instance failures ([Embracing Chaos: How Netflix's Chaos Monkey Transformed ...](https://medium.com/@abhishekv965580/embracing-chaos-how-netflixs-chaos-monkey-transformed-system-resilience-59082412591e#:~:text=Embracing%20Chaos%3A%20How%20Netflix%27s%20Chaos,based%20architecture)) ([The Netflix Simian Army](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html#:~:text=The%20Netflix%20Simian%20Army%20Inspired,abnormal%20conditions%2C%20and%20test)). Chaos Monkey runs during business hours (so engineers are around to see and fix issues immediately) and typically only within auto-scaled clusters (so the cluster will auto-recover a new instance). Because of Chaos Monkey, Netflix’s services are built with redundancy – losing any single node (or a few) should not affect customers at all. It enforces best practices like statelessness and graceful degradation. As a result, when a real instance failure happens (which is common in cloud environments), it’s a non-event.

- **Simian Army:** Chaos Monkey was just the start; Netflix expanded it to a whole suite of “monkeys” known as the Simian Army ([The Netflix Simian Army](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html#:~:text=The%20Netflix%20Simian%20Army%20Inspired,abnormal%20conditions%2C%20and%20test)). Some examples:

  - **Latency Monkey** – injects artificial delays in service calls to test if upstream services handle slow responses (e.g., does the UI time out and show fallback content? Do circuit breakers trip as expected?).
  - **Chaos Gorilla/Chaos Kong** – simulates an entire availability zone or AWS region outage ([The Netflix Simian Army](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html#:~:text=The%20Netflix%20Simian%20Army%20Inspired,abnormal%20conditions%2C%20and%20test)). This tests Netflix’s multi-zone and multi-region failover. Netflix’s infrastructure can shift traffic out of a failed zone/region. For instance, Chaos Kong can drop all services in us-east-1 region; Netflix then verifies that us-west-2 and eu-west-1 (for example) can handle all user traffic without a significant drop in service quality ([The Netflix Simian Army](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html#:~:text=The%20Netflix%20Simian%20Army%20Inspired,abnormal%20conditions%2C%20and%20test)). They have used this to rehearse events like the 2012 Christmas Eve AWS outage and ensure they won’t be caught off guard.
  - **Conformity Monkey** – checks that all instances adhere to best practices (e.g., proper security groups, up-to-date AMIs). If not, it can flag or even shut down non-conforming instances to enforce standards (thereby preventing known issues).
  - **Doctor Monkey** – monitors instance health and proactively removes unhealthy ones (a form of auto-healing).
  - **Security Monkey** – scans for security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations (like open ports that shouldn’t be open) and alerts teams.

  Each “monkey” addresses a different aspect of resiliency or governance, but together they create a constant background of failure and testing that keeps Netflix robust ([The Netflix Simian Army](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html#:~:text=The%20Netflix%20Simian%20Army%20Inspired,abnormal%20conditions%2C%20and%20test)).

- **Game Days and Chaos Drills:** In addition to automated chaos, Netflix conducts planned chaos experiments. A **Game Day** is when they manually simulate a large-scale failure scenario and see how the system and the team respond. For example, they might simulate their primary AWS region being cut off, or their primary database cluster going down. Teams must ensure that runbooks are up to date and the failover mechanisms (like fallback to a backup database or cross-region traffic routing) actually work. These drills build confidence and expose any gaps in procedures.

- **Resilience by Design:** Netflix’s entire architecture incorporates fault isolation: microservices (with circuit breakers, timeouts), regional isolation (each region can run independently if isolated), and fallback logic (e.g., if recommendations service is down, default to popular titles as a fallback). Chaos engineering validates these designs. A real-world example: Netflix ensures that basic playback works even if ancillary services fail. If the personalized recommendations service is unavailable, the UI will still show a non-personalized selection rather than an error – this was tested via chaos engineering and guided by principles of graceful degradation ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=tolerance%20and%20fault%20tolerance%20logic)) ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=Consider%20this%20example%20from%20Netflix%3A,of%20the%20first%20circuit%20breaking)).

The outcome of Chaos Engineering is a culture where failure is expected and tolerated. Engineers design systems assuming things will break. When something does break for real, they’ve likely seen similar scenarios before due to Chaos Monkey tests, so they can fix it quickly or the system self-heals. It’s a major reason Netflix can achieve high availability (often cited as 99.99% uptime) on top of inherently unreliable components.

Worth noting: Netflix gradually open-sourced many of these tools (Chaos Monkey’s code is on GitHub ([Netflix Chaos Monkey Upgraded - Netflix Tech Blog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/10/netflix-chaos-monkey-upgraded.html#:~:text=Netflix%20Chaos%20Monkey%20Upgraded%20,com))), influencing industry practices. Many companies have adopted chaos testing seeing Netflix’s success.

### 9. Security Architecture and Compliance

Streaming content involves not just technical challenges but also protecting valuable intellectual property and user data. Netflix’s security architecture operates at multiple levels: platform security, content protection, and compliance with regulations. Some key aspects:

- **Secure Communication:** All communication in the Netflix ecosystem is encrypted. The Netflix consumer applications communicate with cloud services over HTTPS with strong encryption (TLS). Video content from OCAs to devices is also delivered over HTTPS. This prevents eavesdropping or tampering (which is especially important for DRM; encrypted content chunks are sent over an encrypted channel for double protection). Within Netflix’s cloud (microservice-to-microservice), they likely use authenticated channels (TLS in AWS and mTLS for service calls where needed), though being within a VPC reduces exposure. They’ve also open-sourced **Lemur**, a certificate management tool, implying they manage lots of TLS certificates for various services.

- **Authentication and Identity:** Netflix’s user authentication system issues tokens/cookies to clients upon login. The login service verifies credentials (passwords are stored securely hashed) and implements features like suspicious login detection. Netflix supports login via web, mobile, TV; they likely use OAuth-like tokens for mobile/TV devices. On each request, the client’s token or session cookie is validated by the API gateway (Zuul) or by an auth service, to ensure it’s a legitimate user session. Netflix also integrates with third-party identity providers for certain partnerships (e.g., logging in via TV provider accounts, etc., in some regions). Access to the Netflix app content is strictly tied to a valid account in good standing, which the services (like Playback service) always check ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=2,video%20files%20from%20that%20OCA)) (e.g., ensuring you haven’t exceeded device streaming limits or account isn’t paused).

- **Service-to-Service Authorization:** Internally, they ensure that each microservice can only access what it should. Netflix moved towards a fine-grained authorization system – recent info suggests they developed a “permissions service” to manage internal service permissions (moving away from ad-hoc checks to a centralized model) ([Unwinding a Decade of Assumptions - Architecting New Experiences](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/netflix-architecture-new-experiences/#:~:text=Unwinding%20a%20Decade%20of%20Assumptions,This%20will%20include%20the)). For example, the recommendation service should not be able to directly call the billing service unless allowed. They likely use mutual TLS or signed tokens for service identity. Each service has an identity and role, and an internal policy might allow or deny calls between certain components. This minimizes blast radius if one service is compromised; it can’t freely fetch all data from others.

- **Data Security and Privacy:** Netflix adheres to privacy laws like GDPR. Users can request their personal data or request deletion. Netflix’s data architecture must support deleting or anonymizing personal data on request – which is non-trivial given data spreads across Cassandra, logs, backups, etc. Netflix likely uses data tagging and retention policies to ensure personal info can be purged. For example, viewing history can be deleted per user if requested (they might break the link between the data and the user identity, preserving aggregate stats). They also ensure data is stored securely: sensitive fields (credit card info, personal details) are encrypted at rest. In fact, Netflix may not store full credit card info themselves – they might tokenize and offload to a payment gateway that is PCI compliant, or if they do store it, it’s in a highly secured vault with limited access.

- **Payment and PCI Compliance:** Netflix processes subscription payments globally, requiring compliance with PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry standards). The **Billing service** running on MySQL ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=MySQL)) is likely isolated and firewalled. It might be one of the few services with extremely restricted access. Netflix has to have strong audit trails and access control for any system dealing with credit card data. They probably segment their AWS environment so that only very specific subnets or roles can touch payment data, and undergo regular PCI audits. Many companies use a payment provider for this, but Netflix being large might do a lot in-house with appropriate certifications.

- **Content Security (DRM):** We covered DRM in Section 6, which is a core part of security – it prevents piracy by ensuring that even if someone gets the raw video files, they can’t decrypt them without Netflix’s keys. Netflix rotates keys and can even revoke licenses if a breach is detected. They also implement device security checks – for example, Netflix will not stream HD or 4K to a device that doesn’t have a secure video path (to prevent someone from grabbing the HDMI output). They coordinate with device manufacturers to enforce these restrictions.

- **Infrastructure Security:** Netflix runs on AWS, so they leverage AWS security features – VPC isolation, security groups (firewall rules for instances), IAM roles (restrict what each instance or service can do in AWS). They have the **Security Monkey** tool ([The Netflix Simian Army](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html#:~:text=The%20Netflix%20Simian%20Army%20Inspired,abnormal%20conditions%2C%20and%20test)) that scans for misconfigurations like open security group ports or unused credentials, etc. They also likely run vulnerability scans on their AMIs and containers, and patch regularly. Netflix famously doesn’t have a classic corporate network with a heavy perimeter – instead they prefer a **Zero Trust model** where each service and device must authenticate and be authorized, rather than assuming trust because it’s “inside the network.” This is evident by their use of strong auth and encryption even internally.

- **Compliance and Governance:** Aside from PCI and privacy, Netflix adheres to content regulations (e.g., ensuring kids profiles can’t access adult content – implemented in the profile and playback auth logic) and accessibility (subtitle requirements, etc.). They have internal governance for change management in systems that require high integrity (like billing). They also generate extensive audit logs (for admin actions, data access, etc.) which are monitored for anomalies. Given Netflix’s global presence, they must handle things like EU’s GDPR, California’s CCPA, and others – meaning giving users transparency and control over their data and being careful about cross-border data transfers. Likely, certain data of EU users is processed in EU region to comply with data localization expectations.

- **Employee Access and Studio Security:** Netflix’s internal systems (like those used by Studio and engineers) are protected by SSO and multi-factor authentication. They probably use identity federation for employees and role-based access – e.g., only specific employees can access the content library systems, and even fewer can access raw video files. Content is extremely sensitive before release; Netflix likely uses watermarking and detailed tracking for any pre-release content access. Studio engineering deals with scripts, cuts, etc., which are secured behind hardened systems (there have been cases in industry of leaks, so they are vigilant).

In essence, Netflix’s security is about securing the **three pillars**: the **platform** (cloud infrastructure and services), the **product** (the Netflix app and content delivery, via DRM and auth), and the **data** (personal and payment information). By integrating security checks (like Security Monkey, chaos exercises for security, etc.) into their processes, they maintain a strong security posture without slowing down innovation. In fact, Netflix often talks about how freedom & responsibility extends to security: engineers have freedom but are expected to implement security best practices – the tooling and monkeys help ensure they do.

### 10. Netflix Studio Technology Stack (Content Production Systems)

While the focus of Netflix’s architecture is often on streaming, Netflix also built a significant suite of tools for content production and studio operations – essentially the back-end that helps create the Netflix Originals we watch. The **Studio Technology** stack is a separate domain of microservices and applications tailored to the needs of content creators, producers, and post-production. Netflix’s goal is a “unified, global, digital studio” ([Netflix Studio Engineering Overview | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-studio-engineering-overview-ed60afcfa0ce#:~:text=Netflix%20is%20revolutionizing%20the%20way,effective%20production%20of%20amazing%20content)) that streamlines the journey of a title from idea to streaming on the service.

Key aspects of the studio tech stack:

- **Content Lifecycle Management:** Netflix has internal systems to manage each phase of content:

  - **Greenlighting and Finance:** Tools that ingest a _pitch_ (a proposal for a new show/movie), compare it with historical data (using ML to predict potential audience size, etc.), and assist in deciding what to produce ([Netflix Studio Engineering Overview | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-studio-engineering-overview-ed60afcfa0ce#:~:text=Mission%20at%20a%20Glance)). This involves data on what content works well, budgets, projected viewership. Netflix uses analytics here – sometimes described as using machine learning to inform content investment decisions (though final decisions also involve human judgment).
  - **Production Management:** Once a title is approved, Netflix software helps plan and manage production. This could include scheduling shoots, tracking casting, script updates, and managing the myriad logistics of filmmaking (locations, equipment, etc.). Netflix created applications under the banner “**Prodicle**” (a suite of web apps) to handle things like scheduling and crew communication. For example, there’s a tool for digital call sheets (daily schedules to the crew), another for managing script revisions, and so on.
  - **Asset and Media Management:** As filming progresses, huge amounts of media (video footage, audio, images) are generated. Netflix’s **Backlot** system is the central hub for ingesting final content and related assets ([Backlot Overview for Fulfillment Partners - Netflix | Partner Help Center](https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004872247-Backlot-Overview-for-Fulfillment-Partners#:~:text=Center%20partnerhelp,delivery%2C%20and%20quality%20control%20reporting)). Partners (studios, post-production houses) upload final cuts, subtitle files, audio dubs, etc., into Backlot. Backlot then manages quality control (ensuring files meet specs, no corruption), and feeds the streaming encoding pipeline (it’s likely Backlot triggers the transcode jobs we described in Section 6) ([Backlot Overview for Fulfillment Partners - Netflix | Partner Help Center](https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004872247-Backlot-Overview-for-Fulfillment-Partners#:~:text=Center%20partnerhelp,delivery%2C%20and%20quality%20control%20reporting)). Backlot also tracks status of each deliverable (e.g., a French subtitle file might be “in progress” then “completed”).
  - **Post-production and Localization:** Netflix built or integrated tools for editing, VFX, and especially localization (subtitles and dubbing). They have systems to coordinate translators and dubbing studios around the world, to ensure by launch day they have, say, 30 subtitle languages and 10 dubbing languages ready for a new show. They manage these workflows with custom software that assigns tasks and tracks progress, likely with an element of automation and QC (they even use ML to check subtitle consistency).
  - **Content Quality and Compliance:** Systems ensure that content meets technical standards (4K, HDR, audio loudness, etc.) and content compliance (e.g., assessing age ratings, which might involve tagging scenes with violence, language, etc.). Netflix uses a combination of human review and assisted tools to tag content extensively with metadata (the famous micro-genres come from a detailed tagging process).

- **Infrastructure and Integration:** The Studio systems mostly run in the cloud (AWS) like the consumer systems, but they may have separate VPCs or accounts for security. They also integrate with third-party software common in the industry (e.g., Autodesk Shotgun for VFX, Avid for editing, etc.) by either replacing them with internal tools or connecting via APIs. Netflix’s studio engineering emphasizes cloud-based collaboration: for instance, allowing a director in one country to review footage uploaded from another in near real-time.

- **Analytics in Studio:** Netflix doesn’t stop analyzing data at release; they also analyze data during production. For example, they might track how production timelines compare to plan, or use machine learning to do things like compare script versions to eventual audience engagement (closing the feedback loop to writing). There’s an internal effort to capture data at all steps and use it to improve efficiency (e.g., are certain types of scenes consistently over-budget? Did a certain vendor often deliver late? etc.)

- **User Interfaces:** Unlike the streaming product, studio tools have a smaller user base (Netflix employees and production partners). They are likely web applications (Netflix might use React or other web frameworks internally), and some mobile apps. They focus on usability for Hollywood professionals rather than the general public. For example, there might be an app for cinematographers to view the shooting schedule and upload daily footage metadata.

- **Microservices for Studio:** Under the hood, the studio platform is also microservice-based. Services might include: Title Management Service (master data about each project), Asset Ingest Service, Localization Service, Schedule Service, Payments (for paying vendors/royalties) and so forth. These services populate the Netflix content database that ultimately interfaces with the streaming side (at some point, a title goes from “in production” to “coming soon” to “now streaming”, so the systems connect). They likely leverage the same tech stack – e.g., Cassandra for certain data, Kafka for events (like “Episode 5 locked cut delivered”), and so on.

- **Collaboration and Cloud Workstations:** A forward-thinking part of Netflix Studio is enabling remote collaboration – e.g., cloud-based video editing. Netflix has experimented with moving traditionally on-premise editing to AWS, so editors anywhere can work on the footage (with security). High-end examples: moving CGI rendering to cloud, so artists can use elastic compute for heavy effects. Netflix TechBlog occasionally references this (for instance, using their platform to distribute workloads). They also likely use AWS robustly for archiving raw footage (S3 Glacier for long-term storage of original camera files).

In short, Netflix Studio tech is building the “ERP of content production” – a comprehensive system to manage the creative supply chain. This is a competitive advantage: by optimizing production, Netflix can produce more content efficiently. And from an architecture perspective, it’s a microservice cloud that parallels the streaming side, with its own specialized data (e.g., scripts, contracts, budgets) and integrations.

### 11. Engineering Culture and Organization at Netflix

Finally, it’s important to understand Netflix’s **engineering culture and team organization**, as this is often cited as the “secret sauce” enabling the architecture to work so well. Netflix is known for its culture memo “Freedom & Responsibility” which influences how teams operate and make decisions.

- **Autonomous Cross-Functional Teams:** Netflix organizes engineers into relatively small teams responsible for specific features or components. Each team includes all roles needed (developers, sometimes a test engineer, maybe a program manager, etc.) to deliver and operate their software. For example, a “Playback team” might own the Play API and related services. A “Recommendations team” might own the algorithms and the service that delivers them. Teams are given a high degree of autonomy to decide how to implement things, as long as they meet overarching business goals and interface nicely with others. There is no heavyweight central architecture board gating their choices – engineers are trusted to choose appropriate technologies and designs (within reason, and often they choose to align with existing proven tech like using Java, etc., to not reinvent the wheel). This autonomy allows innovation and speed.

- **“Freedom & Responsibility”:** Engineers at Netflix have a lot of freedom – e.g., freedom to deploy when ready, freedom to refactor code or even recommend using a new language or framework if it significantly helps – but with that comes responsibility for the outcomes. This means if an engineer deploys a buggy service, they are also the ones on call to fix it at 2 AM. This encourages building quality software and thoroughly testing it, since there is personal responsibility. It also means teams are expected to keep security and reliability in mind; there is freedom to design, but if something goes wrong, there isn’t a separate ops or QA team to blame – it’s on the team that built it. This aligns incentives nicely with the microservices architecture, because each team truly owns their microservices _end-to-end_.

- **No Dedicated Ops or QA Departments:** Netflix does not have a traditional NOC or operations team that handles outages while developers sleep. Instead, developers themselves rotate on-call duties for their services. They use the mantra “_You build it, you run it._” If an alert goes off at night that the Recommendations API is failing, an engineer from the recommendations team will handle it. This leads to building more robust self-healing systems (because no one enjoys being paged at night!). Similarly, Netflix doesn’t have a separate QA department through which all code must pass. Teams write their own tests, leverage automated testing, and do incremental rollouts. They often test in production with small audiences. This speeds up development because there’s less handoff and waiting; engineers take direct accountability for quality ([Netflix System Design- Backend Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-backend-architecture-10i3#:~:text=This%20article%20analyzes%20the%20Netflix,system%20design%20for%20engineers%20course)).

- **Hiring Senior Talent:** Netflix tends to hire experienced engineers who can handle this freedom/responsibility model. The culture expects individuals to be self-motivated and able to make good decisions without micromanagement. The compensation and perks are top-of-market to attract and retain such talent. With highly skilled people, they can manage a complex microservices ecosystem relatively leanly – each engineer can own more scope than in a tightly controlled environment.

- **Internal Knowledge Sharing:** With so many teams and services, how do they avoid silos and duplication? Netflix encourages knowledge sharing via internal tech talks, documentation, and rotating engineers between teams. They have an internal wiki and also the public Tech Blog (which often is written by engineers about the projects they did, albeit sanitized for public). This spreads best practices (like how to properly use Hystrix or Spinnaker). They also align on common libraries (the Netflix OSS stack was one way – offering common libraries like Eureka, Ribbon that all teams use, avoids each team inventing their own service discovery, etc.). Platform teams (like the Cloud Platform team that builds Titus or the Performance Engineering team) act as enablers, providing tools that every service team can use.

- **Metrics and KPIs for Teams:** Each engineering team at Netflix is keenly aware of their metrics (e.g., “play start time” for the Playback team, or “recommendation click-through rate” for the Personalization team). The culture is to **measure everything** and use those metrics to drive improvements ([System Architectures for Personalization and Recommendation | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html#:~:text=computational%20complexity%20of%20the%20algorithms,Another%20part%20of%20the)). Teams are therefore organized around business metrics, not just technical components. For example, a “Signup team” will focus on conversion rate of sign-ups, etc. This ensures engineering work aligns with business value.

- **Scalability Approach:** When dealing with scalability, Netflix’s approach is proactive and incremental. They run load tests and model growth so they can scale up capacity ahead of demand. When launching in a new country or releasing a big show, the teams coordinate to ensure the system can handle a surge. Because the architecture is horizontally scalable by design (stateless services, auto-scaling, CDN offload), it’s mostly a matter of adding more servers or more bandwidth. The culture of chaos testing also means they are not surprised by big spikes; they’ve often simulated them. Teams also consider cost – scaling isn’t just technical but also about optimizing AWS spend. Netflix architecture allows them to run **efficiently at scale** (for instance, using Open Connect to cut bandwidth costs, or optimizing encodings to save storage and transfer).

- **Cross-Team Coordination:** With microservices, one risk is that a change in one service could break another if contracts aren’t managed. Netflix mitigates this by strong API contracts and backward compatibility. They often do **evolutionary changes**: e.g., deploy a new API version alongside the old, have clients gradually switch via feature flags, then decommission the old. Teams communicate through design docs and code reviews when something might impact others. The culture emphasizes context – engineers should understand the bigger picture, not just their silo, so they can foresee interactions. And leadership sets high-level alignment (e.g., “we want to move to a foundation model for recommendations” – then multiple teams (data engineering, ML, personalization API) will collaborate on that initiative).

- **Rapid Experimentation:** Because of Netflix’s A/B testing platform, teams are encouraged to try ideas and let data guide decisions. Culturally, this means failure of an idea is okay – if an experiment shows a negative result, that’s a learning. They then pivot or try a different approach. This reduces fear of deploying changes, since they usually start small (a fraction of users) and are backed by data.

- **Evolution Over Revolution:** Netflix’s architecture itself is a product of continuous evolution. The culture avoids big bang reboots. Instead of a large redesign project that could disrupt everything, they iteratively improve. For example, they didn’t jump to containers overnight; they introduced Titus and gradually moved services onto it, learning and adjusting. Similarly, they didn’t rewrite all microservices in a new language at once – they allow introduction of new languages in a targeted way (like Node.js for an edge service in the early 2010s, or using Python for data science), but they manage it so that maintainability remains. This pragmatic approach is guided by senior engineers who have seen hype cycles – they adopt technology that solves real problems at Netflix’s scale.

- **Post-mortems and Learning:** When incidents do happen, Netflix conducts blameless post-mortems. The focus is on _what_ went wrong in the system or process, not _who_ to blame. They then improve the system – often by adding automated checks or updating runbooks. These post-mortems are shared internally so everyone learns. For instance, if a regional failover took longer than expected in a real incident, they will document it and perhaps adjust the Chaos Kong tests to simulate that scenario more often ([The Netflix Simian Army](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html#:~:text=The%20Netflix%20Simian%20Army%20Inspired,abnormal%20conditions%2C%20and%20test)).

In summary, Netflix’s engineering organization is aligned with its architecture: **decentralized but coordinated through strong culture and platforms**. This allows each part of the architecture to improve and scale without a central bottleneck. It’s often said that “**good architecture allows for rapid independent evolution of components**,” and Netflix exemplifies this – teams can independently enhance their microservices (e.g., the recommendations team can deploy a new ML model) without needing to freeze the whole system. The culture ensures they do so responsibly (monitoring, gradually, with fallbacks). This synergy between culture and architecture is a critical reason why Netflix can operate such a complex system and continuously innovate (both on technology and product features) at the pace that it does.

## Conclusion

Netflix’s system architecture is a **benchmark for modern cloud-native design at scale**. It seamlessly blends a microservices-based cloud control plane (for application logic and data) with a globally distributed CDN data plane (Open Connect for content delivery). The architecture was not built overnight, but through years of iteration – breaking the monolith, embracing microservices, offloading video delivery to the edge, and continually refining each part (from encoding pipelines to personalization algorithms).

Throughout this document, we saw how each piece fits together:

- The **historical evolution** set the stage: moving to AWS and microservices to support streaming and global expansion.
- A **high-level overview** showed Netflix as an interplay of client apps, AWS backend services, and the Open Connect CDN working in concert.
- We dived into **microservices**, learning how Netflix uses an API Gateway (Zuul) with smart routing and filtering, service discovery (Eureka), and resilience patterns (Hystrix circuit breakers) to manage hundreds of services that are each focused and scalable. Netflix’s use of patterns like bulkheads, fallbacks, and auto-scaling gives the system self-healing properties.
- We examined Netflix’s **data infrastructure**: polyglot persistence with Cassandra, EVCache, MySQL, and Elasticsearch each serving specific needs, and a powerful **real-time data pipeline** (Kafka -> Spark) feeding the machine learning that drives recommendations and personalization. The ability to crunch trillions of events per day and feed results back into the product is a cornerstone of Netflix’s competitive edge.
- Netflix’s **personalization and search** architecture illustrates how that data infrastructure is applied. Multiple algorithms and models work in tandem, experimented upon through A/B tests, to create a unique experience for each user. The fact that Netflix can show different cover art to different users for the same title, or dynamically re-rank rows for optimal engagement, shows the sophistication of their system.
- The **playback pipeline** section described the journey of a video file from the studio masters to your screen: encoded into many formats, strategically placed on CDN servers worldwide, and streamed using adaptive bitrate technology, all protected by robust DRM. The integration of Open Connect with cloud services for manifest and license generation demonstrates how Netflix marries cloud computing with edge computing effectively.
- In **DevOps and automation**, we saw that technology alone isn’t enough – Netflix’s investment in tooling like Spinnaker for continuous deployment, Titus for container orchestration, and their disciplined use of blue/green deploys and canary testing, ensures that software changes can be rolled out quickly and confidently. Their infrastructure-as-code and auto-scaling means they can handle growth and seasonal peaks (like Christmas holidays binge-watching) without manual intervention.
- The **observability** and **chaos engineering** practices showed Netflix’s commitment to reliability. By monitoring everything (user-level QoS, system metrics) and by constantly injecting failures (Chaos Monkey, etc.), Netflix created an immune system for their platform – problems are detected and resolved before they become outages. This has led to an enviable uptime and performance record, despite running on commodity clouds and networks.
- We reviewed **security** aspects, noting that Netflix secures content with DRM, secures user data with encryption and strict access control, and fortifies its infrastructure following best practices (using tools to automatically scan and fix issues). Compliance with global regulations is handled through thoughtful data architecture (e.g., ability to delete user data).
- The often-overlooked **Studio technology** side revealed that Netflix’s innovation isn’t just in streaming but also in how content is produced. By building a digital production platform, Netflix ensures a tight integration between content creation and distribution – enabling quicker time-to-market and data-informed content strategy.
- Underpinning all of this is Netflix’s **culture** and **organizational structure**. The architecture is effective because the teams operating it are empowered and skilled. The microservices are loosely coupled, and so is the organization – teams coordinate through APIs and metrics rather than micromanagement. The culture of freedom and responsibility, data-driven decisions, and bias for automation yields an engineering force that continuously pushes the boundaries of what the platform can do.

For software architects, Netflix’s architecture offers many lessons:

- **Decouple services and responsibilities** to scale both engineering and performance. But also invest in the platform (service discovery, CI/CD, monitoring) that makes a large microservice ecosystem manageable.
- **Design for failure** at every level: client (graceful degradation), service (circuit breakers), infrastructure (multi-region, multi-AZ, CDN redundancy). And actively test those failures (chaos engineering) to build confidence.
- **Use data to drive architecture** – whether it’s using analytics to optimize encoding bitrates or to personalize UI elements, integrating data pipelines with user-facing systems can create a feedback loop that improves the product steadily.
- **Automate everything** – from testing, deployment, to recovery. Manual processes don’t scale to the level of Netflix (both in number of deploys and in system size). Automation also frees humans to focus on higher-level improvements rather than firefighting.
- **Keep evolving** – the Netflix of today is not the Netflix of 5 years ago. They replaced or rewrote major parts (e.g., moved from Hystrix to resilience4j, from Eureka towards newer service meshes, from monolith to microservices, etc.) gradually as needed. An architecture should never be “done” if the product is growing; it must adapt. Netflix shows how to do that adaptation in an incremental, user-transparent way.

This comprehensive overview has highlighted how Netflix’s architecture works end-to-end. In essence, Netflix has achieved a **highly scalable, resilient, and flexible architecture** that enables it to deliver a rich, personalized streaming experience to over 200 million members worldwide ([Netflix System Design- How Netflix Onboards New Content - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/netflix-system-design-how-netflix-onboards-new-content-2dlb#:~:text=The%20streaming%20wars%20are%20in,onboarding%20system%20and%20open%20connect)), across thousands of device types, over the unpredictable internet – all while continuously improving and innovating. It is a testament to the synergy of good system design principles with cutting-edge technology and a strong engineering culture. Netflix’s architecture will no doubt continue to evolve (e.g., more real-time interactivity, cloud gaming perhaps, more AI-driven features), but the foundational concepts – decoupling, cloud + edge, automation, and experimentation – will remain. Architects can draw inspiration from Netflix’s journey to apply similar patterns at their own scale, keeping in mind the importance of aligning architecture decisions with both technical and organizational strengths.
