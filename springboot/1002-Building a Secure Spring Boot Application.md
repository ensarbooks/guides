By the end, you should be equipped to design and build Spring Boot applications that **avoid the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities**, providing a strong security posture for your software.

Let’s begin our journey by setting up our development environment securely.

## 1. Installation and Setup of Spring Boot for Secure Development

Before coding, ensure your environment is prepared for secure Spring Boot development. Using up-to-date tools and frameworks is the first step in reducing security risks.

**Prerequisites:**

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+:** Spring Boot requires Java 17 or later for the latest versions ([Getting Started | Securing a Web Application](https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web#:~:text=)). Always use a supported, updated JDK to receive the latest security fixes.
- **Build Tool:** Maven 3.5+ or Gradle 7.5+ for dependency management ([Getting Started | Securing a Web Application](https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web#:~:text=)). This guide will assume Maven for examples.
- **IDE:** An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code can be used to create and inspect the project. Ensure your IDE is updated to benefit from security fixes in developer tooling.

**Starting a Secure Spring Boot Project:**

1. **Use Spring Initializr:** Create a new Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializr web interface or via your IDE's Spring project wizard. Include essential dependencies:

   - **Spring Web** (to build REST APIs or web applications).
   - **Spring Security** (for authentication and authorization features).
   - **Spring Data JPA** (for database interactions using ORM, which helps prevent SQL injection by design).
   - **H2 Database** (or your database of choice) for initial development/testing – H2 is an in-memory DB good for demo, but any secure DB (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) can be used in production.
   - **Spring Boot Actuator** (optional, for monitoring and auditing purposes).

   Using Spring Initializr ensures you start with the correct project structure and updated dependencies. All chosen dependencies should be at their latest stable versions to include security patches (we will discuss dependency management later).

2. **Project Structure:** Once generated, note the standard Spring Boot structure (`src/main/java` for code, `src/main/resources` for configuration). A default `application.properties` will be available for configurations. We will harden configurations as we proceed.

3. **Secure Default Configuration:** Out-of-the-box, Spring Boot comes with some secure defaults, but you should verify them. For example:

   - **Server Port:** Consider running on the default port 8080 for development. We will later enable HTTPS on port 8443 in configuration.
   - **Banner and Stacktraces:** In `application.properties`, disable verbose error output in production:
     ```properties
     server.error.include-message=never        # Don't include exception messages in error responses
     server.error.include-binding-errors=never # Don't include binding errors detail (to prevent info leakage)
     ```
     These prevent exposing internal details accidentally through error responses. You can keep them lenient during development but tighten for production.
   - **Logging Level:** Set an appropriate logging level (INFO/WARN) by default. Avoid DEBUG in production as it may log sensitive info.

4. **Dependency Verification:** Open the `pom.xml` (if using Maven) and note the Spring Boot version and dependencies. It’s wise to use a **Spring Boot BOM (Bill of Materials)** to manage versions. The Initializr usually does this for you. All dependencies included should be necessary – remove any that are not needed to minimize the attack surface (as a rule: **don’t include unnecessary dependencies** to avoid pulling in code that could have vulnerabilities ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,of%20a%20Website%20Application%20Firewall))).

5. **Version Control:** Initialize a Git repository for your project. This not only helps in code management but also allows integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated security checks later (part of DevSecOps).

**Configuring HTTPS in Development:**

Using HTTPS (SSL/TLS) even in development is a good practice to ensure encrypted communication. In production, HTTPS is a must – **all traffic should be encrypted to prevent eavesdropping** ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=1)).

- Generate a self-signed certificate for local use or use your organization's development CA. For example, using Java keytool:

  ```
  keytool -genkeypair -alias devcert -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 \
          -dname "CN=localhost" -keypass changeit -storepass changeit \
          -keystore keystore.jks
  ```

  This creates a `keystore.jks` with a self-signed cert for "localhost".

- Configure Spring Boot to use this keystore in `application.properties`:

  ```properties
  server.port=8443
  server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.jks
  server.ssl.key-store-password=changeit
  server.ssl.key-password=changeit
  ```

  This will enable SSL on port 8443 with the given keystore. In a real environment, use strong passwords and proper certificate management (and obviously, never use "changeit" in production!).

- Enforce HTTPS: In development you might allow HTTP for convenience, but you can also programmatically enforce HTTPS in Spring Security configuration (shown later). The key takeaway is **HTTPS should be used in all environments where possible** to protect data in transit ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=1)).

**Running the Application:**

At this point, you should be able to run the Spring Boot application (e.g., using `./mvnw spring-boot:run`). With Spring Security on the classpath, a default security configuration is applied: it generates a default user with a random password at startup (printed in the log). This is just for initial testing. We will configure our own security shortly. For now, verify the app starts and you can reach it (likely a basic error page since we have no controllers yet).

**Summary for Setup:** Use the latest Spring Boot with Java 17+, include only necessary dependencies, configure basic security settings (like TLS), and verify the app runs. With this solid starting point, we can focus on understanding vulnerabilities and how to code defensively against them.

Next, we will delve into the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities to understand what we're protecting against and how.

## 2. Deep Dive into OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

The **OWASP Top 10** is a standard awareness list of the most critical web application security risks. We will review each of these vulnerabilities in the context of a Spring Boot application – how they occur, their impact, and how to prevent them. By designing our application with these in mind, we aim to eliminate these common weaknesses.

### 2.1 A1: Injection

**Description:** Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, tricking the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without authorization. The classic example is **SQL Injection**, where an attacker appends SQL code to input (like form fields or URL parameters) to manipulate the database. For instance, consider the following vulnerable code snippet:

```java
String userId = request.getParameter("id");
String query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID = '" + userId + "'";
jdbcTemplate.execute(query);
```

If `userId` is not validated, an attacker could set `id` to something like `' OR '1'='1` in the URL, turning the query into:

```sql
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID = '' OR '1'='1';
```

This condition is always true (`'1'='1'`), so the query would return **all accounts**, exposing sensitive data. This is exactly how a basic SQL injection works ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=A%20code%20injection%20happens%20when,was%20not%20designed%2Fprogrammed%20to%20do)).

**Impact:** Injection attacks can lead to data leakage, data loss, or even full system compromise (e.g., via **OS command injection** if the app constructs shell commands, or **LDAP injection**, etc.). In SQL injection, attackers can extract or modify database information they're not supposed to access, often gaining administrative data or user credentials.

**Prevention in Spring Boot:** The core principle is **never mix untrusted data with commands**. Use safe APIs that handle separation of code and data. In practice:

- **Use Parameterized Queries or ORM:** Always use placeholders (`?` or named parameters) for user inputs in SQL, or better, use an ORM like Spring Data JPA or MyBatis which by default parameterize queries. For example, instead of string concatenation for the query above, use Spring's `JdbcTemplate` with `queryForList` and parameters, or define a repository method in JPA:

  ```java
  @Repository
  public interface AccountRepository extends JpaRepository<Account, Long> {
      @Query("SELECT a FROM Account a WHERE a.custID = :id")
      Account findByCustID(@Param("id") String id);
  }
  ```

  Spring will bind the `id` parameter safely, preventing any SQL injection through that field ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=4)). The OWASP recommendation is to prefer safe APIs or ORMs that handle this for you ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=Preventing%20SQL%20injections%20requires%20keeping,separate%20from%20commands%20and%20queries)).

- **Input Validation:** Validate inputs on the server side (length, format, type) to reject obviously malicious input (more on this in section 4.2). While validation alone is not a complete defense, it reduces the injection payloads that reach your query ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,writing%20software)).

- **Escape Special Characters:** If you absolutely must construct queries dynamically (rarely needed with modern frameworks), ensure you properly escape special characters for that context. But remember, some things (like SQL keywords, identifiers) cannot be safely escaped if fully user-controlled, so it's best to avoid dynamic queries with user input for those parts.

- **Least Privilege for Database User:** Configure the database credentials used by your app to have only necessary privileges (e.g., the app might only need read/write to certain tables, and no DDL rights). This won't stop injection, but can limit the damage (an injected query might fail if it tries to do something the user cannot).

In Spring Boot, using Spring Data JPA (with repository methods or the Criteria API) will inherently use prepared statements under the hood. **Avoid using `EntityManager.createQuery(string)` or `createNativeQuery(string)` with string concatenation.** If native queries are necessary, use parameters as shown or a _NamedQuery_ with parameters.

By following these practices, your application can avoid injection vulnerabilities. As OWASP notes, the key is _keeping data separate from commands_ ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=Preventing%20SQL%20injections%20requires%20keeping,separate%20from%20commands%20and%20queries)). We will apply these techniques in our case study later to ensure no injection flaws.

### 2.2 A2: Broken Authentication

**Description:** Broken Authentication covers weaknesses in the authentication mechanism that could allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities. This includes issues like weak passwords, credential stuffing (trying lists of stolen credentials), no account lockout on brute force, session fixation, or exposed session IDs.

For example, an application might allow unlimited login attempts with no lockout, enabling attackers to **brute-force** passwords. Or it might use easily guessable passwords or ship with a default admin password. Another scenario: the app doesn’t invalidate session IDs on logout or reuse them after login, allowing an attacker who steals a session cookie to keep accessing the account.

Broken authentication is widespread – many websites have flaws in their auth logic. It often comes down to **logic errors** or **bad practices** in how authentication is implemented ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=A%20broken%20authentication%20vulnerability%20can,complete%20control%20over%20the%20system)). Common symptoms include: allowing automated attacks (credential stuffing, brute force), using default or weak passwords, improper session management (IDs not rotated or invalidated), and exposing sensitive authentication data.

**Impact:** If authentication is broken, attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts or even the entire system (if they get an admin account). This can lead to data theft, fraudulent transactions, or abuse of application functionality.

**Prevention in Spring Boot:**

- **Leverage Spring Security**: Spring Security provides a robust framework for authentication and session management out of the box ([Features :: Spring Security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/features/index.html#:~:text=Spring%20Security%20provides%20comprehensive%20support,libraries%20to%20simplify%20its%20usage)). Using it correctly can address many issues by default (e.g., it handles password hashing, session fixation protection, etc.). Don’t reinvent the wheel – configure Spring Security instead of writing your own auth logic whenever possible.

- **Strong Password Policies**: Enforce strong credentials:

  - Require a minimum password length (e.g., 8 or more characters) and consider requiring a mix of characters. _However_, avoid overly complex rules that users circumvent; modern guidance (e.g., NIST 800-63B) emphasizes length and checking against known bad passwords over arbitrary complexity.
  - Check passwords against a list of common weak passwords (e.g., don't allow "password123"). OWASP recommends testing new passwords against the top 10k worst passwords ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=%2A%20Where%20possible%2C%20implement%20multi,1%20for%20Memorized)).
  - Never store passwords in plain text. Use a **strong one-way hash** with salt (e.g., BCrypt). Spring Security's `BCryptPasswordEncoder` is a good choice; it handles salting and is computationally expensive to thwart brute force. For example:
    ```java
    PasswordEncoder encoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    String hashedPw = encoder.encode(plainPassword);
    ```
    Store `hashedPw` in the database. During login, you’ll use `encoder.matches(rawPassword, storedHash)` to verify. This way, even if the password database is leaked, it's hard to crack (unsalted or weak hashes, by contrast, can be cracked quickly ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=the%20user%E2%80%99s%20private%20data,even%20if%20they%20were%20salted))).

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Where possible, implement MFA to add a layer of security ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=%2A%20Where%20possible%2C%20implement%20multi,complexity%20and%20rotation%20policies%20with)). Spring Security can integrate with an MFA provider or you can code an OTP (one-time password) verification step. While not built-in, third-party libraries or extensions can help, and OAuth2/OpenID Connect providers often support MFA.

- **Prevent Enumeration**: Be careful not to reveal if a username exists or not via verbose messages or timing. For example, return a generic "invalid username or password" for login failures. Also, in registration or password reset, use the same messaging whether an email is registered or not, or add generic delays, to not disclose valid accounts ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,and%20API%20pathways%20are%20hardened)).

- **Brute Force Mitigation**: Implement **rate limiting** or exponential backoff on login attempts. You can use in-memory counters or integrate with tools like Bucket4j or Spring Security's built-in user lockout after X attempts. Also log and alert on suspicious attempts (multiple failures) ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=NIST%20800,force%2C%20or%20other%20attacks%20are)).

- **Secure Session Management**: Upon login, Spring Security by default will issue a new session Id (protecting against session fixation attacks) and will invalidate the session on logout. Ensure this is true – do not disable these features. We will cover session details in section 6, but in short: **never expose session IDs in URLs** (Spring uses cookies by default, which is good), **rotate session IDs after login** (Spring does this by default), and **invalidate sessions at logout or after a timeout** ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,or%20a%20period%20of%20inactivity)).

- **No Default Credentials**: If your application has any kind of default user or password (even for admin consoles or third-party integrations), change them. Do not ship with "admin/admin" or any such account ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=%2A%20Where%20possible%2C%20implement%20multi,credentials%2C%20particularly%20for%20admin%20users)). Also, force users (especially admins) to change initial passwords on first login.

By following these practices, you minimize the risk of broken authentication. In Spring Boot, a lot is handled by configuring Spring Security properly instead of writing custom auth code. Later, we will configure an OAuth2/JWT based authentication and also demonstrate using Spring Security's built-in features (like user detail service and password encoder) to handle logins securely.

### 2.3 A3: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Description:** Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when an application does not properly protect sensitive information such as personal data, financial info, or passwords. This can happen in transit or at rest. Examples include not using HTTPS (allowing an attacker to snoop on data in transit), storing sensitive data in clear text (in databases, log files, etc.), or using weak encryption algorithms. Essentially, the app fails to adequately protect data that needs safeguarding.

**Impact:** If sensitive data (like user passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal identifiable information - PII) is exposed, it can lead to privacy violations, financial fraud, identity theft, and legal consequences (violating regulations like GDPR or HIPAA). For instance:

- Without encryption in transit, an attacker on the same network can sniff credentials or session cookies (a **Man-in-The-Middle** attack).
- If data at rest is not encrypted, a server breach could leak all data. Or if passwords are unsafely stored, a database dump could allow attackers to crack them.
- In one OWASP scenario, an application that _did_ encrypt credit card numbers in the database still exposed them because SQL injection allowed an attacker to retrieve the decrypted data (the encryption was transparent with the DB user having rights) ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=%2A%20Scenario%20,session%2C%20accessing%20or%20modifying)).
- Another scenario: a site not enforcing TLS, so an attacker downgrades connections and steals session cookies, taking over user accounts ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=%2A%20Scenario%20,session%2C%20accessing%20or%20modifying)).

**Prevention in Spring Boot:**

- **Encrypt Data in Transit (HTTPS):** Always use HTTPS for all client-server communication ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=Both%20types%20of%20data%20should,by%20having%20an%20SSL%20certificate)). We already set up SSL for development; in production, obtain a valid TLS certificate and configure your server (Tomcat/Undertow in Spring Boot, or a reverse proxy like Nginx) to redirect HTTP to HTTPS. Consider using HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) header to force clients to use HTTPS. This ensures data like login credentials, tokens, personal info, etc., cannot be read if intercepted. Modern browsers and platforms consider non-HTTPS websites as insecure by default.

- **Secure Transmission of Credentials:** Never transmit passwords or sensitive tokens in plain text. Spring Security automatically does this over HTTPS if configured. Avoid schemes like sending password via email or in URL parameters. Also, use secure protocols for backend calls (if your app calls an external API, use their HTTPS endpoints).

- **Encrypt Sensitive Data at Rest:** Identify sensitive data your application handles (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers, SSNs, etc.). Do not store them in plaintext in the database:
  - **Passwords**: as discussed, store as salted hashes (BCrypt). This way, even if the DB is compromised, the actual passwords are not immediately exposed ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=the%20user%E2%80%99s%20private%20data,even%20if%20they%20were%20salted)).
  - **Other sensitive fields**: Consider column-level encryption. For example, if you store credit card numbers, encrypt them using a strong algorithm (AES-256) and store the encryption key securely (not in the source code!). You can use JPA `AttributeConverter` to automatically encrypt/decrypt an entity field. There are libraries like Jasypt that integrate with Spring Boot to decrypt properties or fields on the fly. Encryption ensures that even if someone gains DB access, they cannot read sensitive fields easily.
  - **Configuration Secrets**: Treat API keys, DB passwords, etc., as sensitive. Do not commit them to source control. Use Spring Boot’s support for externalized configuration or Spring Cloud Config with encryption, or Vault integration to fetch secrets at runtime.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Data Storage:** Don't collect or store data you don't need. If you don't store it, it can't be exposed. For example, don't log credit card details or passwords. If collecting sensitive info (like files, personal data), consider if you can tokenize or truncate it (store only partial info needed for operations).

- **Use Strong Encryption and Protocols:** When using cryptography, use proven libraries (Java's AES/Crypto libraries, BouncyCastle, etc.). Avoid home-grown crypto. Ensure you use current standards (e.g., TLS 1.3 or 1.2 for transport; avoid deprecated SSL/TLS versions and ciphers). In Spring Boot’s `application.properties`, you might configure allowed ciphers/protocols if needed. Also, when storing passwords, use algorithms designed for hashing (BCrypt, PBKDF2, Argon2). For other data encryption, use AES or RSA as appropriate (and never use obsolete algorithms like MD5 or SHA1 for security purposes).

- **Proper Disposal:** If your app generates sensitive data (like a report with personal data), ensure it's properly protected and deleted when no longer needed. Also, be mindful of data in backups or caches.

- **Compliance and Guidelines:** Follow industry standards or regulations applicable. For example, PCI DSS for credit cards requires encryption of cardholder data and strict access controls. GDPR requires protecting personal data. Implement measures like masking data in UI (show only last 4 digits of SSN, etc.) for extra safety.

Spring Boot apps benefit from the platform's features: e.g., use **Spring Security** to handle password hashing, use **Spring Config** or **Vault** for secrets, and rely on the Java security providers for encryption. Always test that sensitive data is indeed encrypted (e.g., inspect the database to ensure you see hashes or cipher text, not clear text). Also, consider scenarios like serialization: if you're caching objects that contain sensitive data, are they being serialized anywhere insecurely? We'll talk about one such risk (Insecure Deserialization) next.

### 2.4 A4: XML External Entities (XXE)

**Description:** XXE vulnerabilities occur in applications that parse XML input and do not configure the XML parser to disable external entity resolution. XML allows defining external entities that can refer to files or URLs. An attacker can craft XML input that, when parsed by a vulnerable server, might disclose local files or make HTTP requests to internal systems (SSRF via XML). For example, an attacker might submit an XML like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]>
<login>
  <username>&xxe;</username>
  <password>pass</password>
</login>
```

If the XML parser allows it, `&xxe;` will be expanded to the content of `/etc/passwd`, potentially returning system files in the response. XXE can lead to file disclosure, internal port scanning, or remote code execution in some cases.

**Impact:** XXE can expose sensitive files on the server, enable SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) by making the server fetch URLs, or even DoS the application (billion laughs attack) by recursive entity expansion.

**Prevention in Spring Boot:**

- **Avoid XML Parsing if Not Needed:** If your REST APIs use JSON (as is common with Spring Boot + Jackson), you may not parse XML at all. By default, Spring Boot will include Jackson XML if the dependency is present and might accept XML if `MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter` is configured. If your app doesn’t need XML, you can disable or not include XML converters to reduce risk.

- **Secure XML Parser Configuration:** If you do accept or use XML (e.g., SOAP or config files, or XML payloads), configure the XML parser to disallow external entities. For instance, if using JAXP (javax.xml), do:

  ```java
  SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
  factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
  factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
  factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
  ```

  This disables external entity resolution and disallows DOCTYPE declarations entirely (preventing any entity definitions). Similar configurations exist for DOM and other parsers.

  Spring's `XmlMapper` (from Jackson XML) can be configured to forbid XXE as well.

- **Use Latest Libraries:** Use XML parsing libraries that are not vulnerable by default. Some newer ones have XXE prevention turned on by default. Always check library docs.

- **Validation:** If possible, validate XML against a schema (XSD) that does not allow DOCTYPE. This can prevent malicious content from being processed.

In summary, treat XML input with caution. In our case study, unless XML is a required data format, we will likely stick to JSON which uses Jackson by default (and does not have an XXE issue). However, if your Spring Boot app processes XML (for example, reading XML config uploads or integrating with SOAP), implement these protections.

### 2.5 A5: Broken Access Control

**Description:** Broken Access Control refers to failures in enforcing restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do. Even if authentication is correct, the application might not properly check user roles or permissions, allowing users to perform actions or access data they shouldn't. Examples:

- A low-privileged user can access an admin-only URL or function by guessing the URL (e.g., `/admin` endpoints) because the app doesn’t check roles.
- A user can manipulate a URL or request parameter to access another user's record (IDOR - Insecure Direct Object Reference) because the app only uses user-supplied IDs without verifying ownership.
- Methods or URLs that should be restricted are not (e.g., not enforcing checks server-side, or client-side only controls that can be bypassed).

Access control means **defining what resources or actions each user (or role) should be allowed**, and ensuring all requests enforce those rules. Broken Access Control is very common and can occur in many forms ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=match%20at%20L532%20that%20broken,you%20use%20on%20your%20website)).

**Impact:** If access control is broken, users can escalate privileges (regular user acting as admin) or access unauthorized data (one user reading/modifying another’s data). This can completely compromise confidentiality and integrity of the application data. For instance, an attacker could retrieve other users' accounts, modify data, or perform admin actions.

**Prevention in Spring Boot:**

- **Deny by Default:** As a principle, any request that isn’t explicitly allowed should be denied ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,the%20data%20from%20other%20users)). In Spring Security, configure your HTTP security to authenticate all endpoints except those you explicitly open (e.g., the login page or public resources). For example:

  ```java
  http.authorizeRequests()
      .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
      .antMatchers("/api/mydata/**").hasRole("USER")
      .anyRequest().authenticated();
  ```

  Here, any request not matched by the preceding rules requires authentication (and since no blanket permitAll is given except maybe for static resources or login, everything needs proper auth).

- **Enforce Server-side Checks:** Never rely solely on client-side enforcement (like hiding an admin button in the UI). Assume an attacker can forge any request. Always check user roles/permissions on the server for every sensitive action:

  - Use Spring Security annotations like `@PreAuthorize` on controller or service methods to enforce role checks. For example:
    ```java
    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
    @DeleteMapping("/users/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<?> deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) { ... }
    ```
    This ensures only admin can invoke deleteUser ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=Method%20level%20authorization%20problems%20happen,normally%20scoped%20to%20administrator%20roles)).
  - For horizontal access (user data ownership), validate that the currently authenticated user has access to the specific resource. For instance, if a user tries to GET `/api/accounts/12345`, in the controller or service you must verify that 12345 is owned by the auth user (or the user has a role to view others). This might involve checking a field in the `Account` entity (like `account.ownerId == currentUser.id`). In JPA, you might have a query method that filters by owner:
    ```java
    Account findByIdAndOwner(Long id, String ownerUsername);
    ```
    By using the authenticated username, you only retrieve if the account belongs to them. If null is returned, either the ID is invalid or not owned by them – handle appropriately (throw access denied).
  - For every function (method) that should have restricted access, use either method security or manual checks. It is good to centralize these rules to avoid something being missed. Spring’s method security (with `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled=true)` or Spring Security 6's new method security configuration) helps apply consistently.

- **Reuse Access Control Mechanisms:** Define your security rules in one place (like Spring Security config or method annotations) and reuse them, rather than scattering logic. This reduces mistakes ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,the%20data%20from%20other%20users)). For instance, if both a web controller and a REST controller access the same service, enforce security at the service layer so both are covered.

- **Minimize CORS exposure:** Only allow cross-origin requests if needed and only from trusted origins. Misconfigured CORS could let a malicious website invoke your APIs with a logged-in user's credentials. Lock down any CORS configuration to specific origins and methods if your API is not completely public ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,the%20data%20from%20other%20users)).

- **Disable directory listing / secure file access:** If your app serves files, make sure directory browsing is off and users can’t access files by guessing paths (ensure no sensitive file repositories are web-accessible) ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,minimize%20the%20harm%20from%20automated)). In Spring Boot, by default resources in classpath under static are served, but you might keep sensitive files out of those locations.

- **Logging and Alerts:** Log access control failures and ideally alert on them ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,harm%20from%20automated%20attack%20tooling)). For example, if someone repeatedly tries to access admin pages and gets HTTP 403, that could be an attack reconnaissance. Spring Security can throw `AccessDeniedException`; you can handle it with an `AccessDeniedHandler` to log such events.

- **Rate Limiting:** Although more related to abuse, rate-limit sensitive endpoints (like failed access attempts) to make brute force or repeated IDOR attempts harder ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,harm%20from%20automated%20attack%20tooling)).

Spring Security handles a lot, but custom access rules (like record ownership) you must enforce in your code. In our case study, we'll ensure that a user cannot access or modify another user's data by always scoping queries by the current user. We will also demonstrate the use of roles (USER vs ADMIN) in the application.

### 2.6 A6: Security Misconfiguration

**Description:** Security Misconfiguration is a broad category covering any insecure setup of the application or the server. This can include:

- Using default configurations that are insecure (default admin accounts, default passwords, sample applications left enabled, etc.).
- Unpatched software or frameworks.
- Improper file permissions, leaving sensitive config files exposed.
- Enabling too much debug or verbose error output in production.
- Misconfigured HTTP headers or CORS (which might expose the app to clickjacking, XSS, etc., if not set).
- Running in development mode in production (e.g., with debug endpoints open).

In short, misconfiguration means the application or environment is not securely configured, often leaving an otherwise secure app vulnerable ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,Unnecessary%20services)). For example, leaving the **actuator endpoints** wide open in Spring Boot (they can leak info or allow shutdown of app if not secured), or deploying with the example "test" Tomcat apps still on the server (which have known flaws) ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=Examples%20of%20Security%20Misconfiguration%20Attack,Scenarios)).

**Impact:** Misconfigurations can lead to various attacks. Default credentials or open admin consoles lead to immediate compromise. Outdated software might have known vulnerabilities exploited by attackers (see A9 as well). Exposed config files might leak secrets. Essentially, misconfiguration can open the door to attackers without them needing to exploit a code bug.

**Prevention in Spring Boot:**

- **Secure Default Config in Production:** Before deploying, review all default settings:

  - Change any default passwords or keys (e.g., for databases, message brokers, etc. that your app relies on).
  - Disable or secure **Spring Boot Actuator** endpoints. Only enable what you need and require authentication/authorization on them. For example, in `application.properties`:
    ```properties
    management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=false    # disable shutdown if not needed
    management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info  # only expose non-sensitive endpoints
    management.endpoint.health.show-details=never # or when_authorized
    ```
    And secure the actuator path via Spring Security if it's exposed.
  - Remove any sample or test controllers before production. (E.g., a leftover H2 database console or a test endpoint that prints environment variables would be dangerous.)

- **Apply Patches and Updates:** Keep your Spring Boot version and dependencies up to date ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,of%20a%20Website%20Application%20Firewall)). Many attacks target known vulnerabilities that have patches available. Use tools (discussed in DevSecOps section) to identify outdated dependencies. Also keep the JDK and server OS updated with security patches.

- **Least Privilege:** Run your application with only the privileges it needs:
  - If deploying on Linux, run the process as a non-root user. If using Docker, use a non-root user in the container.
  - Give your Spring Boot application only access to necessary network ports, files, and other resources. For example, it probably doesn’t need access to system files outside its directory.
  - Ensure file permissions for config files (like application.properties if it contains secrets) are restrictive (no world-readable configs).
- **Disable Unnecessary Services/Features:** Turn off any feature not in use. For example:

  - If not using JMX, disable it or ensure it's not open remotely.
  - If not using an embedded server’s AJP connector (Tomcat), disable it (some default configs might have had these open in older versions).
  - Review your build for any libraries that bring in an admin console (for example, some dev tools) and exclude them in prod.

- **HTTP Security Headers:** Spring Security can add many by default (like X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, X-Frame-Options). Ensure these are enabled to harden the app. For example, enabling Content Security Policy (CSP) if your app delivers HTML can greatly reduce XSS risk. We will show some header config in the deployment section if needed.

- **Environment Separation:** Use separate config for dev, test, prod. In prod, use `spring.profiles.active=prod` (and have `application-prod.properties`) with production-safe configs (e.g., stricter logging, real database, security settings). This avoids accidentally running with dev settings in prod.

- **Monitoring and Auditing Config:** Ensure you have monitoring on your servers – an IDS/IPS like OSSEC or cloud security monitoring to catch misconfigurations ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=Not%20having%20an%20efficient%20logging,damage%20of%20a%20website%20compromise)). It can alert if someone changes a config or if an unexpected port opens.

In summary, treat configuration as code: put it under version control, review it, and harden it. We'll keep this in mind for our example app – using Spring's profiles to differentiate dev vs prod and ensuring we don't leave any unsafe setting for production deployment.

### 2.7 A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Description:** XSS is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=Cross%20Site%20Scripting%20,website%20as%20a%20propagation%20method)). In a Spring Boot context, XSS mainly threatens applications that render HTML (e.g., Thymeleaf templates, JSPs, or any HTML in responses) or that serve content consumed by browsers (even a REST API could inadvertently pass unsafe data that a client puts into the DOM). The three types of XSS are:

- **Reflected XSS:** Malicious script is in the request (like in a query param) and the app immediately reflects it in the response without proper escaping. E.g., an error page that displays your input back to you.
- **Stored XSS:** Malicious script is stored on the server (in a database, comment field, etc.) and then displayed to users later without sanitization. This is often more dangerous (affecting any user who views the content).
- **DOM XSS:** The vulnerability is in the client-side JavaScript – e.g., the front-end JS modifies the page based on user input in an unsafe way (not directly a server issue, but servers can aid or mitigate it by sanitizing data).

**Impact:** If XSS succeeds, an attacker can hijack other users’ sessions, deface websites, redirect users, or spread malware. Essentially, the attacker can execute any actions the user could, and see any data the user sees. For instance, an attacker could steal the session cookie and impersonate the victim. With stored XSS on an admin-facing page, an attacker might take over admin accounts.

**Prevention in Spring Boot:**

- **Output Encoding (Escaping):** The primary defense is to properly escape all user-supplied data before outputting it in a webpage. If using a template engine like Thymeleaf or JSP, by default they escape HTML characters in variables. For example, Thymeleaf will convert `${name}` into safe text (so if `name = "<script>alert(1)</script>"`, it renders as `&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;` on the page, neutralizing it). **Do not disable or bypass escaping**. Only in special cases, if you need to allow HTML, ensure you sanitize it first.

  - In Thymeleaf, avoid using `th:utext` (unescaped text) unless you run the content through a sanitizer.
  - In Spring MVC with Freemarker or other, ensure auto-escaping is on for the template engine.

- **Use Security Headers:** Implement a strong **Content Security Policy (CSP)** header to mitigate impact of XSS ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=context,from%20permitted%20content%20delivery%20networks)). A CSP can restrict what scripts can run (e.g., only allow scripts from your domain or disallow inline scripts). Even if XSS exists, CSP can make it much harder to execute malicious code. Spring Security can add CSP headers via its headers configuration:

  ```java
  http.headers().contentSecurityPolicy("default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trustedscripts.example.com; object-src 'none';");
  ```

  This is an advanced measure but significantly reduces XSS risks as defense-in-depth ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=context,from%20permitted%20content%20delivery%20networks)).

- **Avoid Inline JavaScript with User Data:** Don’t directly write user inputs into `<script>` tags or event handlers. For example, never do: `<div onclick="doSomething('${userInput}')">`. If you must use user data in scripts, use safe functions or encode it as JSON and parse.

- **Validate Input (for XSS specifically):** While output encoding is the main defense, input validation can help by blocking input that is clearly malicious (e.g., containing `<script>` tags) if your application never expects HTML. However, be careful: attackers can hide scripts in various ways (e.g., `<img onerror="js code">`), so validation is not foolproof. It's more effective to _sanitize_ input if you allow HTML content:

  - If users can submit rich text (like comments with formatting), use a sanitizer library to strip dangerous HTML. OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer or Jsoup can be used to allow only safe tags.

- **Protect JSON endpoints if used in <script>:** A lesser-known XSS vector is if you serve JSON and someone puts it in a script tag (JSON is valid JS). If your API returns JSON and doesn't require authentication, consider adding `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header so browsers don't treat JSON as JS. Spring Security does this by default.

- **Use frameworks to your advantage:** Modern frameworks like React or Angular auto-escape content and make XSS harder by design ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,modifying%20the%20browser%20document%20on)). If you use a JS framework on the client, leverage that. On the server side, Spring Boot mostly concerns itself with sending data; ensure whichever layer renders HTML (server or client) is doing so safely.

In Spring Boot MVC, if you stick to templating and do not manually concatenate untrusted input into HTML, you're largely protected. We'll ensure in our case study that any data displayed is properly encoded. For API responses (JSON), XSS is not directly a server issue, but if that JSON is later inserted into HTML by a client, the same principles apply: the client must safely handle it. We will also include relevant security headers in our final configuration.

### 2.8 A8: Insecure Deserialization

**Description:** Insecure deserialization refers to vulnerabilities that arise when an application accepts serialized data (binary or structured) from an untrusted source and deserializes it without proper checks. This can lead to remote code execution, injection attacks, or other exploits if the data is manipulated maliciously. Java's native serialization has had many known exploits: an attacker can send a serialized object stream that, when deserialized, executes code via gadget chains.

In a Spring Boot app, you might encounter serialization if you use features like:

- HTTP sessions clustering (if Java serialization is used for session objects).
- Messaging (reading Java objects from JMS, etc.).
- Caches or persistence that automatically deserialize data.
- Accepting serialized input via REST (not common, as JSON/XML are text, but some apps allow file uploads of serialized objects).
- Using the default Java serialization in any RMI or similar.

**Impact:** Exploiting insecure deserialization can be severe. Attackers could achieve remote code execution on the server if they can load classes with dangerous readObject methods. Even if not code execution, they could tamper with serialized data to escalate privileges (e.g., change a role flag in a serialized cookie, if the app doesn't sign it).

**Prevention in Spring Boot:**

- **Never accept serialized Java objects from untrusted sources.** If your application does not need to handle binary serialized data from users, don't. For instance, using JSON for APIs avoids this risk entirely because JSON deserializers (like Jackson) won't execute arbitrary code – they just create simple POJOs (though even there, be cautious of allowing polymorphic types; Jackson had some vulnerabilities in the past when using default typing). As OWASP advises, the best solution is to **not accept serialized objects from an untrusted source** ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=How%20to%20Prevent%20Insecure%20Deserializations)).

- **Use Secure Deserialization Techniques:** If you do need to deserialize data:

  - Use formats like JSON or XML which map data to types explicitly and have secure parser settings (and ideally require expected types, not allowing arbitrary classes).
  - If using Java serialization, consider using a validation approach: e.g., use a whitelist of allowable classes for deserialization. The `ObjectInputStream` can be subclassed to only allow certain class names. For example:
    ```java
    ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(inputStream) {
        @Override
        protected Class<?> resolveClass(ObjectStreamClass desc) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
            if (!allowedClasses.contains(desc.getName())) {
                throw new InvalidClassException("Unauthorized deserialization attempt", desc.getName());
            }
            return super.resolveClass(desc);
        }
    };
    ```
    This ensures only expected classes are deserialized.
  - Implement integrity checks: Sign the serialized data or include an HMAC, so if an attacker tampers with it, you detect it ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20protect,serialized%20objects%20from%20untrusted%20sources)). For example, if you absolutely must send a serialized object to the client (not recommended), hash it with a secret key and verify on receipt.

- **Use Isolation:** If deserialization of complex objects is needed, run that code in a low-privilege environment or sandbox if possible ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,and%20outgoing%20network%20connectivity%20from)). This is an extreme measure and complex to do in a typical Spring app (usually not necessary unless you deal with user-provided binary data heavily).

- **Update Libraries:** Many deserialization issues in Java are fixed by updating libraries (for example, newer versions of commons-collections, etc., that were exploited in gadget chains). Use latest Spring and related libraries so known gadget exploitation paths are mitigated.

In practice, Spring Boot applications that stick to JSON for input and output and don't use Java serialization for anything user-supplied will not suffer this issue. We will not be using Java serialization in our case study; session data will remain on server side (or in signed cookies if we use JWT), and all client-server communication will be JSON over HTTP. If you use distributed sessions or cache, consider using JSON or an encoding like Base64 with a secure method, rather than default Java serialization.

### 2.9 A9: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

**Description:** Modern applications use many third-party libraries and frameworks. If any of these have known vulnerabilities and are not kept up-to-date, your application can be exploited through one of those components. This risk is about **dependency management**. For example, an older version of Spring Framework might have a vulnerability that an attacker can exploit via a certain malformed request. Or you might include a logging library that has a flaw (consider the Log4j "Log4Shell" incident). Using an outdated jQuery or Bootstrap in your UI can also expose XSS or other issues on the client side.

**Impact:** The impact can be as severe as the vulnerabilities in those components. If you include a library that has a known RCE vulnerability, your app can be compromised even if your own code is secure. Attackers regularly scan for apps using known vulnerable versions (like a specific HTTP header might reveal version, or just try known exploit payloads). This risk is high because many organizations fail to track and update all the libraries in use.

**Prevention in Spring Boot:**

- **Inventory and Awareness:** Keep track of all client-side and server-side components you use ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,of%20a%20Website%20Application%20Firewall)). This includes transitive dependencies that your direct dependencies bring in. Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk can generate reports of vulnerabilities in your project. Spring Boot’s BOM helps keep consistent versions, but you must update the BOM version itself to get newer dependencies.

- **Update Dependencies Regularly:** Make it a routine to update to the latest patch versions of Spring Boot and other libraries. Spring Boot releases updates that often include dependency updates for security. For example, if using Spring Boot 3.x, keep an eye on 3.x.x releases for security notes. Use your build tool to list outdated dependencies. Many vulnerabilities are fixed simply by bumping a version number and rebuilding ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=7)).

- **Monitor Vulnerability Feeds:** Check sources like the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)** and CVE feeds for libraries you use ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,of%20a%20Website%20Application%20Firewall)). You can subscribe to security mailing lists or RSS feeds from Spring (Spring gives security advisories on their site ([Features :: Spring Security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/features/index.html#:~:text=Solutions))). There are also GitHub integrations that alert you if your project (in a repository) depends on a vulnerable library.

- **Remove Unused Dependencies:** If there's a library you ended up not using, remove it from the project ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,of%20a%20Website%20Application%20Firewall)). Less code = fewer potential vulnerabilities. Every dependency is a potential risk.

- **Use Dependency Management Tools:** Leverage tools:

  - **OWASP Dependency-Check**: Scans your project dependencies (Maven, Gradle) for known CVEs.
  - **Snyk or Whitesource (WhiteSource)**: These can be integrated into CI pipelines to fail a build if a high severity vuln is present.
  - **Maven enforcer plugin**: to enforce certain versions (to avoid accidental inclusion of an old version through a transitive dependency).
  - If using Docker, also scan your container images for vulnerable OS packages.

- **Component Integrity:** If you download any components manually or use front-end libraries, use subresource integrity (SRI) for scripts, or verify checksums of downloads. Only obtain libraries from official sources ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,of%20a%20Website%20Application%20Firewall)) (e.g., Maven Central for Java libraries). This reduces risk of supply chain attacks (where someone compromises a library in a package repository or the download source).

Spring Boot itself simplifies some of this by bundling a lot of components together and managing their versions. But you as the developer must stay on top of updates. In our case study, we'll mention checking for updates as part of the deployment process. Remember, **a single vulnerable library can undermine your entire application**. For example, the Spring4Shell vulnerability in Spring Framework impacted apps using certain configurations; those who promptly upgraded Spring Framework/Spring Boot were safe ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=Spring%20Boot%20is%20widely%20used,a%20severe%20implications%20for%20organizations)). Staying current is key.

### 2.10 A10: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

**Description:** This vulnerability isn't about a direct exploit in code, but rather a weakness in operational security. Insufficient logging and monitoring means the application and its environment do not effectively record security-relevant events or alert on anomalies, so attacks go unnoticed. For instance, if your system doesn't log failed login attempts or strange requests, an attacker could be probing or actively exploiting and you'd have no clue until it's too late. Furthermore, not monitoring those logs (or having no alerting) means even if events are logged, no one responds in time.

**Impact:** According to OWASP, the time to detect a breach is often measured in months. A lack of monitoring and alerting can prolong the damage. For example, an attacker may have gained access to an admin account; if you have no logs or alerts of unusual admin activity, they could maintain persistence and do serious damage (steal data, install backdoors) without detection ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=According%20to%20OWASP%2C%20these%20are,to%20insufficient%20logging%20and%20monitoring)). Insufficient logs also hinder forensics after an incident – you might not know what data was accessed or how the attack happened.

**Prevention in Spring Boot (and generally):**

- **Enable Logging of Key Events:** Your application should log significant security events, such as:

  - Login successes and failures (with context, except don’t log sensitive info like passwords). Spring Security by default logs at DEBUG, but you can use an `AuthenticationSuccessEvent`/`FailureEvent` listener or configure Spring Security's audit events.
  - Access control failures (403 errors) – these indicate someone tried to do something they weren't allowed to.
  - Input validation failures that look suspicious.
  - Exceptions and errors (to catch if an attack payload caused an error).
  - Startup configuration info: so you know what config was in effect (for troubleshooting).

  Spring Boot’s **Actuator** has an audit events feature which can capture authentication and authorization events. By default, it captures login attempts and outcome if you enable it:

  ```yaml
  management.auditevents.enabled: true
  management.auditevents.events.include: AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESS, AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE, AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE
  ```

  These can then be accessed via Actuator or your logs.

- **Protect Logs & Log Usefully:** Ensure logs are stored securely (attackers will try to clear them if they get in). Use append-only logging or external log management (ELK stack, Splunk, etc.). Also, log enough information to be useful: timestamps, user ids involved, IP addresses, what action was attempted, etc., but **avoid logging sensitive data** like full credit card numbers or passwords (to avoid creating a new sensitive data exposure). Mask or omit those.

- **Centralize and Monitor Logs:** Use a centralized logging system so that even if one server is compromised, the logs are stored elsewhere. Set up alerts for certain events:

  - Too many login failures -> alert (possible brute force).
  - Spike in 500 errors -> alert (could be attempted exploitation).
  - Rarely used functionality being invoked -> could indicate misuse.

  Solutions like Splunk, Elastic Stack (ELK), or cloud monitoring (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor) can be configured to send notifications or trigger actions on such events.

- **Implement an IDS/IPS or WAF:** This goes beyond app coding, but tools like an Intrusion Detection System can monitor log files or network calls for malicious patterns ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=Here%20at%20Sucuri%2C%20we%20highly,root%20check%2C%20and%20process%20monitoring)). For example, OSSEC can watch system logs and alert on suspicious activity (failed su, etc.) ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=Here%20at%20Sucuri%2C%20we%20highly,root%20check%2C%20and%20process%20monitoring)). Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can also log and block obvious malicious requests (like SQL injection attempts), providing another source of monitoring.

- **Testing and Drills:** Practice incident response. For example, run a penetration test and see if your logging catches it. Ensure your team knows how to access and interpret logs quickly.

In our Spring Boot context, we'll ensure that we enable appropriate logging. Spring Boot by default logs to the console; in production, you might log to file and then aggregate those. We might also use the Actuator to expose important events (but secure that endpoint). The key is that if an attack does occur, we have a trail and ideally an alert. As OWASP suggests, insufficient logging and monitoring can make even a minor breach turn catastrophic because you fail to respond in time ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=Not%20having%20an%20efficient%20logging,damage%20of%20a%20website%20compromise)).

---

Having reviewed the OWASP Top 10, we have a solid understanding of what can go wrong and what countermeasures to apply. Next, we’ll move from theory to practice: we'll discuss how to implement secure authentication/authorization in Spring Boot, then other best practices, and finally integrate everything into a cohesive example application.

## 3. Secure Authentication and Authorization in Spring Boot

Authentication and authorization are the cornerstones of application security: authentication verifies a user's identity, and authorization determines what that identity can do. Spring Boot, via Spring Security, provides comprehensive support for both ([Features :: Spring Security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/features/index.html#:~:text=Spring%20Security%20provides%20comprehensive%20support,libraries%20to%20simplify%20its%20usage)), including protections against common exploits. In this section, we will set up a robust security configuration for our application, including OAuth2 logins and JWT-based stateless API security, and enforce **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** rules.

### 3.1 Integrating Spring Security

Spring Security should be included as a dependency (which we did during setup). Once on the classpath, it secures all endpoints by default (requiring authentication for all URLs) with a default user. We'll replace that with our own config:

- **Security Configuration Class:** Create a class annotated with `@Configuration` and `@EnableWebSecurity` (also `@EnableMethodSecurity` for enabling method-level annotations in Spring Security 6, or the older `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` in Spring Security 5). This class will allow us to configure the authentication and authorization settings:

  ```java
  @Configuration
  @EnableWebSecurity
  @EnableMethodSecurity   // enable @PreAuthorize, etc.
  public class SecurityConfig {

      @Bean
      public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
          http
            .csrf().csrfTokenRepository(CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse())
               // config CSRF (we'll discuss CSRF in detail later)
            .and()
            .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                .requestMatchers("/public/**", "/auth/**").permitAll()  // public endpoints like login, registration
                .requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .sessionManagement(session -> session
                .sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)
            )
            .httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults()); // or formLogin for form-based auth
          return http.build();
      }

      // Additional bean configurations (UserDetailsService, PasswordEncoder, etc.) will go here...
  }
  ```

  Let's break down some of these configurations:

  - We permit all access to URLs under `/public` or `/auth` (which we will use for things like the landing page, health check, login endpoints, etc.).
  - We restrict `/admin/**` URLs to users with the role ADMIN.
  - Everything else (`anyRequest()`) must be authenticated (logged in).
  - We set session management to stateless. This is because we plan to use JWT for APIs. If we were doing a server-side session (traditional web login), we might use `SessionCreationPolicy.IF_REQUIRED` (stateful sessions) and configure form login.
  - We call `httpBasic()` as an example to allow basic auth (useful for testing or simple API auth), but in a real app with JWT, we might not use basic. For a form login scenario, we would use `http.formLogin()` to enable the default login page or our custom page.
  - We configured CSRF token repository with cookies (this is useful for a web app scenario; for pure APIs with JWT, we might disable CSRF as it's not needed for stateless auth tokens).

  We'll refine this configuration as we proceed (especially regarding stateless vs stateful and CSRF settings, depending on use case).

- **Password Encoding:** As stressed earlier, always encode passwords. Define a `PasswordEncoder` bean:

  ```java
  @Bean
  public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
      return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
  }
  ```

  Spring Security will use this to hash passwords. If you create users in-memory or via a UserDetailsService, it will expect passwords to be encoded. (In Spring Security 5+, if you use `{noop}` prefix, you could use plain text for testing, but never do that in production.)

- **UserDetailsService:** We need to tell Spring Security how to load user information (username, password, roles) during login. There are a few approaches:

  - **In-Memory Users:** Good for demos or testing. Example:
    ```java
    @Bean
    public UserDetailsService users() {
        UserDetails admin = User.withUsername("admin")
            .password(passwordEncoder().encode("adminPass"))
            .roles("ADMIN")
            .build();
        UserDetails user = User.withUsername("user")
            .password(passwordEncoder().encode("userPass"))
            .roles("USER")
            .build();
        return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(admin, user);
    }
    ```
    This sets up two users with roles. This is not for production (where you'll use a database), but it's a quick way to test authentication.
  - **Database Users (JPA):** Typically, you create an `ApplicationUser` entity and a repository. Then implement a `UserDetailsService` that finds the user by username/email and returns a `UserDetails` object. For example:
    ```java
    @Service
    public class MyUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {
        @Autowired
        private UserRepository userRepo;
        @Override
        public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
            UserEntity user = userRepo.findByUsername(username)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found"));
            return org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User.builder()
                      .username(user.getUsername())
                      .password(user.getPassword())  // already encoded in DB
                      .roles(user.getRole())         // assuming a single role for simplicity
                      .build();
        }
    }
    ```
    Then you'd register this with authentication manager. In Spring Security 5, that was done in a configure method. In Spring Security 6, if using `SecurityFilterChain`, you can just have the bean and it should pick it up, or use `http.authenticationManager(authManager)` if needed.

- **OAuth2 and Social Login (Optional):** Spring Boot makes it easy to implement OAuth2 login (e.g., "Login with Google"). This involves adding spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client and some configuration properties. While our case study may not focus on social login, be aware that Spring Security can handle the OAuth2 Authorization Code flow, managing client IDs, secrets, and redirect URIs for you. If needed, you would add:
  ```java
  http.oauth2Login().defaultSuccessUrl("/home").and()...
  ```
  and configure clients in `application.properties` (client-id, client-secret for Google, etc.). This gives you an OAuth login without storing passwords locally, which can enhance security (but is beyond our current scope to detail fully).

### 3.2 Implementing JWT Authentication (Stateless API Security)

For APIs, a common approach is to use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication. In this model, when a user logs in (with username/password or via OAuth2), the server generates a JWT, signs it (with a secret or private key), and returns it to the client. The client then sends this token on each request (usually in an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header). The server validates the token's signature and extracts the user info, thus authenticating the request without storing any session on the server.

**Why JWT?** It allows scaling (no session sticky), and decouples auth from backend storage on each request. However, it requires careful handling of signing keys and token expiration.

**Steps to Implement JWT in Spring Boot:**

1. **Generate JWT on Login:** We'll create an authentication endpoint (`/auth/login`) that accepts credentials, authenticates the user (via `AuthenticationManager`), and if successful, generates a JWT. For example:

   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/auth")
   public class AuthController {
       @Autowired AuthenticationManager authManager;
       @Autowired JwtUtil jwtUtil; // a utility to generate/validate tokens

       @PostMapping("/login")
       public ResponseEntity<?> login(@RequestBody LoginRequest request) {
           try {
               Authentication authentication = authManager.authenticate(
                   new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(request.getUsername(), request.getPassword()));
               UserDetails user = (UserDetails) authentication.getPrincipal();
               String jwt = jwtUtil.generateToken(user);
               return ResponseEntity.ok(new JwtResponse(jwt));
           } catch (BadCredentialsException ex) {
               return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED).body("Invalid credentials");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   In the above, `authManager.authenticate` will use our `UserDetailsService` and `PasswordEncoder` to verify credentials. If successful, we use a `JwtUtil` (to be implemented) to create a token. We return that token to the client (typically, you'd include some user info or roles as needed in the response).

   We need to define `JwtUtil.generateToken(UserDetails user)`. This would do something like:

   ```java
   // Pseudocode for JwtUtil
   String generateToken(UserDetails user) {
       Date now = new Date();
       Date expiry = new Date(now.getTime() + JWT_EXPIRATION_MS);
       return Jwts.builder()
           .setSubject(user.getUsername())
           .claim("roles", user.getAuthorities().stream().map(GrantedAuthority::getAuthority).collect(Collectors.joining(",")))
           .setIssuedAt(now)
           .setExpiration(expiry)
           .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, secretKey)
           .compact();
   }
   ```

   Use a strong secret key (and keep it secret, e.g., store in application.properties or better, environment variable). Also set a reasonable expiration (e.g., 15 minutes or an hour) – **do not use extremely long-lived tokens** ([JWT Security Best Practices | Curity](https://curity.io/resources/learn/jwt-best-practices/#:~:text=short%20an%20expiration%20time%20for,valid%20for%20days%20or%20months)). If a token is stolen, short expiry limits damage.

   The token typically includes claims like username, roles, and issued/expiry times. You might also include a nonce or unique ID to prevent reuse (but with JWT you can't easily revoke without a store, so plan accordingly).

   **Note:** There are libraries (like io.jsonwebtoken JJWT or using Spring Security OAuth2 Resource Server with an opaque token to JWT conversion) that can help manage JWTs. Use them instead of writing your own cryptography whenever possible.

2. **Validate JWT on Requests:** We need a filter that runs on each request to parse the JWT from the header and set the authentication in Spring Security context if valid. Spring Security allows adding a once-per-request filter before the filter chain:

   ```java
   @Component
   public class JwtAuthFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
       @Autowired JwtUtil jwtUtil;
       @Autowired UserDetailsService userDetailsService;
       @Override
       protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
               throws ServletException, IOException {
           String authHeader = request.getHeader("Authorization");
           if (authHeader != null && authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
               String token = authHeader.substring(7);
               String username = jwtUtil.extractUsername(token);
               if (username != null && SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication() == null) {
                   if (jwtUtil.validateToken(token)) {
                       UserDetails user = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username);
                       UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authToken =
                             new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(user, null, user.getAuthorities());
                       authToken.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(request));
                       SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authToken);
                   }
               }
           }
           chain.doFilter(request, response);
       }
   }
   ```

   This filter checks for a Bearer token, validates it (signature and expiry), and if valid, loads the user details (to get roles) and sets an Authentication in the context. After this, Spring Security knows the user is authenticated for the rest of the processing of that request.

   We need to register this filter in our `SecurityConfig`. We can do:

   ```java
   http.addFilterBefore(jwtAuthFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
   ```

   to ensure it runs before the default authentication filter.

3. **Configure Security to be Stateless:** We set `.sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(STATELESS)` as shown, so the security context is not stored in an HTTP session. Each request must bear the token.

4. **CSRF Consideration:** When using stateless JWT, you typically **disable CSRF protection** for your APIs because CSRF defense is mainly needed for stateful sessions with cookies. In our config, we might call `http.csrf().disable()` if our entire app is stateless. (If you have a mix of JWT APIs and form login pages, you need CSRF for the form parts and can either separate the configs or handle accordingly.)

**Best Practices for JWT:**

- **Short Expiration and Refresh:** As mentioned, keep JWT life short (minutes to an hour) ([JWT Security Best Practices | Curity](https://curity.io/resources/learn/jwt-best-practices/#:~:text=short%20an%20expiration%20time%20for,valid%20for%20days%20or%20months)). Implement a refresh token mechanism if you need long sessions (refresh tokens can be stored securely and exchanged for new JWTs).
- **Secure Storage on Client:** Advise clients to store JWTs securely (preferably in memory or secure storage, not in plain localStorage if XSS is a risk – though if XSS, any token is at risk; HTTP-only cookies with JWT can protect against XSS stealing at expense of needing CSRF protection).
- **Signing Algorithm:** Use a strong algorithm. HS256 (HMAC-SHA256) with a long random secret or RS256 (RSA) with a private/public key pair. Do not use "none" and beware of the alg header tampering (the library should handle this).
- **Token Contents:** Do not put sensitive data in JWT payload; it's just base64 encoded and easily decoded ([JWT Security Best Practices | Curity](https://curity.io/resources/learn/jwt-best-practices/#:~:text=,this%20goal%2C%20but%20they%20differ)). Only include what is necessary (user id, roles, perhaps a display name, but not things like passwords or personal info). If there's sensitive info needed by client, fetch it via a secure API rather than embedding in the token.

Spring Security has **OAuth2 Resource Server support** that can validate JWTs for you if configured with the signing key. This is an alternative to the manual filter approach and is recommended for robustness. For brevity, we've shown a conceptual filter, but note that real implementation should handle exceptions (like token parsing errors) gracefully (maybe returning 401).

### 3.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Method Security

We've touched on roles earlier (User vs Admin). To implement RBAC:

- Decide your roles and authorities. Spring Security uses `GrantedAuthority` (by default, roles are prefixed with "`ROLE_`"). In our example, "USER" and "ADMIN" roles suffice.
- Assign roles to users (in the UserDetails or user database).
- Protect URLs or methods based on roles:
  - URL config (as in our SecurityConfig `.antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")`).
  - Method config with `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` on specific methods that only admin should use.
  - You can also use expressions, e.g., `@PreAuthorize("#id == principal.id")` to check that a method’s id parameter matches the current user's id – this is another way to enforce ownership at the method level. Alternatively, use a custom permission evaluator or just code inside method.

**Example: Method Security for Record Ownership** – Suppose we have a `TaskService` with a method to retrieve a task by id:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN') or @securityService.isTaskOwner(#taskId, authentication.name)")
public Task getTask(Long taskId) { ... }
```

Here, we assume we have a bean `securityService` with method `isTaskOwner(taskId, username)` that returns true if the user owns the task. This expression in `@PreAuthorize` ensures either admin can access anyone's task or the owner themselves can. This is an advanced use of Spring Security's expression-based access control.

For simpler cases, we might just do the check in code:

```java
Task task = taskRepository.findById(taskId);
if (task == null) throw new NotFoundException();
if (!task.getOwner().equals(currentUser) && !currentUser.isAdmin()) {
    throw new AccessDeniedException("Not your task");
}
return task;
```

Using Spring Security context to get `currentUser` (via `SecurityContextHolder`) or better, injecting the `Authentication` object into the method (Spring allows injecting `Principal` or `Authentication` into controller methods directly).

**Note on Authority Design:** You might have more granular authorities than just roles. Spring Security doesn’t force you to use “ROLE”, you can have authorities like "TASK_READ" or "TASK_WRITE". Manage them as needed (roles can be grouping of authorities). In an advanced scenario, consider a library like Spring Security ACL module for object-level permissions – but that’s complex and beyond our scope.

### 3.4 Additional Authentication Measures

- **Account Lockout:** To prevent brute force, consider locking an account temporarily after X failed logins. Spring Security doesn’t provide this out of the box in simple config, but you can implement a check in your `UserDetailsService` to see if an account is locked and throw a `LockedException`. You'd need to track failed attempts (in DB or cache).
- **Password Reset and Recovery:** Implement secure flows for forgotten passwords. Use one-time tokens (sent via email) with expiry for resetting passwords. Do not reveal if an email is registered (to avoid user enumeration).
- **Concurrent Session Control:** If using sessions, you can limit how many sessions a user can have (to prevent, say, the same account being used from multiple locations if that's a concern).
- **Two-Factor Auth:** As mentioned, consider 2FA for critical accounts (you might integrate with an external service or use an authenticator app TOTP).
- **Session Hijacking Protection:** Spring Security auto-includes session fixation protection (new session on login). If using sessions, also ensure cookies are secure & HttpOnly.

We have now a secure foundation: using Spring Security to authenticate (via database or in-memory), using JWT for stateless API calls, and enforcing roles/permissions for authorization. We will use these setups in our case study. Next, let's cover other best practices like input validation, API security details, and data protection which we will then also apply to the case study.

## 4. Best Practices for API Security, Input Validation, and Secure Data Storage

In this section, we discuss best practices that complement authentication/authorization to further secure a Spring Boot application. This includes designing secure APIs, validating all inputs to prevent malicious data from doing harm, and securely storing data and secrets. These practices overlap with some OWASP Top 10 items but are worth focusing on as distinct implementation concerns.

### 4.1 API Security Best Practices

Designing and implementing secure APIs (especially RESTful APIs) involves several considerations beyond auth:

- **Use HTTPS Everywhere:** As stated before, APIs should only be served over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. In many deployments, you might terminate SSL at a load balancer or API gateway. Ensure end-to-end encryption if the internal network isn’t fully trusted. In short, **HTTPS is non-negotiable for secure API communication** ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=1)).

- **Secure Endpoints with Proper Auth:** Every API endpoint should require appropriate authentication/authorization unless explicitly intended to be public. Use the Spring Security config to secure URL patterns. Avoid creating “backdoor” endpoints that bypass security (sometimes done for testing – make sure to remove or secure them).

- **Least Privilege for API tokens:** If using API keys or JWTs, scope them to what is necessary. For example, if you issue an API token to a third-party service for specific endpoints, don’t let that token access unrelated APIs. You can use different user accounts with limited roles for different clients, or include scopes in JWTs and check them in your security logic.

- **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** APIs are susceptible to brute force or denial-of-service if not rate limited. Implement rate limiting per IP or per user to mitigate abuse. Spring doesn't have built-in rate limiting, but you can use libraries (Bucket4j, resilience4j) or API gateway features. For example, if you deploy behind a proxy like Nginx or use cloud API Gateway, configure it to throttle requests to reasonable rates.

- **Protect Against CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Issues:** By default, browsers prevent scripts from calling your API from other domains unless you explicitly allow it via CORS headers. Configure CORS properly if your API is meant to be called from scripts on some domain. E.g., using Spring Web MVC, you can annotate controllers or use `WebMvcConfigurer` to allow specific origins:

  ```java
  @Bean
  public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
    return new WebMvcConfigurer() {
        @Override
        public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
            registry.addMapping("/api/**")
                    .allowedOrigins("https://trusteddomain.com")
                    .allowedMethods("GET","POST","PUT","DELETE");
        }
    };
  }
  ```

  Be cautious to **not set `allowedOrigins("*")` in production** unless you truly intend a public API accessible via any website. Also allow only the methods and headers needed. CORS misconfiguration can let malicious sites trick a user's browser into using their credentials to call your API (this ties into CSRF as well for cookies).

- **Input/Output format validation:** Ensure your JSON or XML parsing is configured securely (we touched on XXE for XML). For JSON, use a well-configured Jackson (Spring Boot does this by default). If you expect certain fields, consider using validation (discussed next) to ensure required fields are present and well-formed.

- **No Sensitive Data in URLs:** Avoid putting sensitive info in URL query params (e.g., passwords, tokens). URLs can end up in logs (like access logs) or browser history. Use POST body for such data or headers for tokens.

- **Versioning and Deprecation:** Not a security measure per se, but managing API versions ensures you can update security measures without breaking clients (e.g., removing insecure endpoints in v2 while leaving v1 for backward compat until deprecation).

- **Use API Gateways or Firewalls:** In a production environment, an API gateway can provide an extra layer of security: JWT validation, IP filtering, threat detection (like AWS API Gateway or Apigee, etc.). Similarly, a WAF can block common attack patterns (SQLi, XSS in inputs). For Spring Boot, deploying behind something like Nginx or CloudFlare can mitigate certain attacks (like rate limiting, some injection patterns). These are additional defenses.

- **Return Proper HTTP Status Codes:** For example, 401 for unauthorized, 403 for forbidden, 400 for validation errors, 500 for server errors (but try not to leak stacktrace or internal info in body). This isn't directly security, but consistency here avoids confusing clients and also avoids accidentally revealing too much. Spring Boot's default error response in JSON includes some details which you might disable (as we did via properties in setup).

By adhering to these API practices, you reduce the chance of common vulnerabilities and make your API more resilient. We will ensure our case study's API endpoints follow these principles (all secured, using HTTPS, no data leaks, etc.). Next, we focus on input validation—a critical coding practice to prevent bad data from causing harm.

### 4.2 Input Validation and Data Sanitization

**Never trust user input** – this is a fundamental rule ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=3)). Input validation means verifying that incoming data conforms to what your application expects. This can prevent a variety of issues, from injection attacks to simple bugs.

Spring Boot (with Spring MVC) provides convenient support for validation through JSR 303/380 Bean Validation (using hibernate-validator by default).

**Best Practices for Validation:**

- **Define Validation Rules with Annotations:** For request bodies or form inputs, use annotation constraints:

  ```java
  public class UserInput {
      @NotEmpty(message="Name cannot be empty")
      @Size(max=50)
      private String name;
      @Email(message="Email should be valid")
      private String email;
      // getters/setters...
  }
  ```

  Then in your controller:

  ```java
  @PostMapping("/register")
  public ResponseEntity<?> registerUser(@Valid @RequestBody UserInput userInput, BindingResult result) {
      if(result.hasErrors()) {
          // collect errors and return 400 Bad Request
      }
      // proceed with using userInput safely
  }
  ```

  The `@Valid` annotation triggers validation. If using Spring WebFlux or others, the approach is similar. For path or request parameters, you can also use `@Validated` on the controller class and `@Valid` on `@PathVariable` or `@RequestParam` where applicable.

- **Server-Side Enforcement:** Do all validation on the server even if you have client-side validation. Never assume the client sent valid data (attackers can bypass client checks).

- **Validate Size and Type:** All inputs should be checked for maximum length (to prevent huge payloads or buffer overflows in downstream processing). For example, if a username should be max 20 chars, enforce it. If a number must be positive, use `@Min(1)`, etc. This not only helps security but also robustness (prevents unexpected conditions deeper in code).

- **Validate Format:** Use regex or specific annotations for format. For instance, use `@Email` for emails (which checks basic structure). If accepting phone numbers, you might use a pattern. If it's a known set of values (enum), validate against that. Use **allow-lists** (whitelists) where possible – e.g., only allow certain characters in input (like letters, numbers, limited punctuation) ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,writing%20software)). This inherently prevents a lot of injections (like disallowing `<` `>` in a name field prevents XSS via that field).

- **Sanitize Inputs if Needed:** In some cases, you may want to cleanse data rather than reject it. For example, trim whitespace, or strip HTML tags from a comment (if you allow some HTML but want to remove scripts, you might sanitize instead of reject). Use a well-tested library for sanitization if doing HTML (like OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer). For general string clean-up, Apache Commons Text has some functions.

- **Don't Over-Trust Numeric IDs:** Even after validation, remember to enforce authorization on any ID references (to avoid IDOR). Validation might ensure the ID is numeric, but you must still ensure the current user is allowed to access that ID.

- **Validate on Boundaries:** For example, for paging parameters pageSize, perhaps enforce an upper limit (don’t allow pageSize=10000 if you only expect at most 100).

- **Global Validation Rules:** If there are inter-field dependencies (like startDate < endDate), implement a custom validator.

Spring’s validation framework will help produce readable errors you can return to API consumers. Just be careful not to expose too much info – e.g., if an internal constraint fails, you might want to generalize the error message.

**Output Encoding:** While validation is about inputs, output encoding is its counterpart for output. We covered output encoding for XSS in section 2.7. If returning data to users, ensure you encode it appropriately (HTML encode for HTML context, etc.) ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,this%20cannot%20be%20avoided%2C%20similar)). For REST APIs that return JSON, the framework will handle JSON encoding for you (converting characters to Unicode escapes if needed). You primarily need to worry about output encoding when mixing user data into HTML or scripts.

**File Upload Validation:** If your app accepts file uploads, validate those too:

- Check the content type (and don't trust just the extension).
- Scan files if necessary (antivirus or malware scanning services).
- Set size limits (to avoid denial of service by filling disk or memory).
- Store in a safe location (not where it could be served as is and executed as code).

**Preventing Deserialization issues:** If you accept JSON/XML, ensure the object mapping doesn’t allow unintended types. In Spring Boot with Jackson, avoid using default typing unless you know what you’re doing, as it can introduce polymorphic deserialization vulnerabilities. Prefer binding to specific DTO classes.

To summarize, validate **everything** that comes from the client: headers, query params, path vars, body content. It should be routine to think "Does this value meet the criteria I expect?" If not, reject it with an error. This not only helps security but improves the stability of your application.

Our case study will include examples of using `@Valid` for request DTOs and ensuring we only accept legitimate data (e.g., no negative quantities, properly formatted email, etc.).

### 4.3 Secure Data Storage and Encryption

Securing data at rest is just as important as securing it in transit. This spans how you store data in databases, files, and configuration.

**Key areas:**

- **Password Storage:** We have emphasized this but to reiterate: store passwords using one-way hashes (BCrypt or Argon2). **Never store raw or reversibly encrypted passwords**. Spring Security's `BCryptPasswordEncoder` automatically handles salt and multiple rounds (strength of 10 by default). A code example from earlier:

  ```java
  user.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode(clearTextPassword));
  userRepository.save(user);
  ```

  This way, even if the user table is leaked, passwords are not in plain text. Also consider adding pepper (a site-wide constant added to password before hashing, stored separately) if you want to further strengthen against attacks that breach the DB but not your application server.

- **Database Secrets:** The database credentials (username/password) that your app uses should be stored securely. _Do not hardcode them in your source code._ Use `application.properties` or environment variables, and secure those:

  - If using `application.properties`, don't commit the real secrets to version control. Use placeholders and supply real secrets via environment-specific config or env vars at runtime.
  - Consider using **Spring Boot's support for encrypted properties**. There are integrations like Spring Cloud Config with symmetric or asymmetric encryption, or using a tool like Jasypt with Spring Boot to decrypt properties on the fly. For example, Jasypt allows `spring.datasource.password=ENC(encryptedblob)` and uses a key to decrypt.
  - Alternatively, use a secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.). Spring Cloud Vault is an option if Vault is available; it can inject secrets into the app securely ([Advanced Spring Boot Security: Implementing OAuth2, JWT, and Custom Authentication – Code Frosting](https://www.codefro.com/2024/08/29/advanced-spring-boot-security-implementing-oauth2-jwt-and-custom-authentication/#:~:text=,in%20libraries%20like%20Spring%20Security)).
  - Ensure backup copies of config (or code) do not inadvertently contain secrets.

- **Encrypt Sensitive Fields in Database:** Identify data that would be critical if leaked. Common examples: personal data (SSN, DOB), financial data, healthcare data. Use column encryption for those if possible:

  - Some databases support transparent encryption or secure enclaves.
  - Application-level: You can use JPA `AttributeConverter` to encrypt/decrypt automatically. For example:
    ```java
    @Converter
    public class CryptoConverter implements AttributeConverter<String,String> {
       private static final String SECRET = "secretkey123...";
       @Override
       public String convertToDatabaseColumn(String sensitive) {
           // encrypt sensitive using SECRET (e.g., AES)
       }
       @Override
       public String convertToEntityAttribute(String dbData) {
           // decrypt using SECRET
       }
    }
    ```
    Then annotate fields with `@Convert(converter = CryptoConverter.class)`. This way, the database only sees encrypted text. Keep in mind key management – that SECRET must be protected, ideally not hard-coded (fetch from environment or keystore).
  - If using a cloud database, check if they offer encryption at rest by default (most do, but that's disk-level encryption; consider application-level for defense-in-depth).

- **File Storage:** If your app saves files (uploaded documents, etc.), ensure the storage medium is secure:

  - Use access controls (if on AWS S3, use proper IAM policies).
  - Encrypt files if they are sensitive. You could encrypt before storing or use a storage that handles encryption (S3 has server-side encryption). For highly sensitive files, end-to-end encryption (where you manage keys) is preferable.
  - Do not store files in a web-accessible directory without controls (to avoid someone fetching by guessing filename).

- **Backups:** Ensure backups of your database or data are encrypted and secured, as they often get overlooked and can be stolen.

- **Audit Data Access:** For especially sensitive data, log access. For instance, if someone views a credit card or exports user data, generate an audit log. That way, if a breach happens, you can trace what data might have been accessed (this crosses into monitoring as well).

- **Retention and Purging:** Store data only as long as necessary. For compliance (like GDPR), you might need to delete user data upon request or after some time. Keeping old data indefinitely increases risk exposure.

- **Key Management:** If you use encryption keys for any of the above, secure them properly:

  - Use hardware security modules (HSM) or cloud key management services (KMS) when possible.
  - At minimum, restrict access to keys. For example, if using a symmetric key for encryption in code, maybe load it from an environment variable that’s set in the server and not visible elsewhere.
  - Rotate keys periodically and have a process to re-encrypt data with new keys if needed.

- **Using Hashes for Data Integrity:** Sometimes you might store a hash of data to later verify it hasn't been tampered with. This is less common inside a controlled app environment, but if you allow say file downloads, computing a hash and storing it can allow verifying the file later.

In Spring Boot, implementing these often involves configuration or small code additions (like the JPA converter). It's also important to use **trusted encryption libraries** (use Java's built-in AES/Crypto libraries or well-known ones; avoid writing your own crypto algorithm).

Our case study will demonstrate secure password storage and will mention how one would integrate something like an encrypted field if needed (for demonstration we might not fully implement encryption of a field, but will outline it). It will also assume that any secrets (like JWT signing key or DB creds) are coming from secure config and not hard-coded.

Now that we've covered securing communication, inputs, and data storage, let's move to how to manage user sessions safely and protect against CSRF in scenarios where it applies.

## 5. Secure Database Interactions (ORM, SQL Injection Prevention, Encryption)

_(Note: There's some overlap with previous sections on injection and data storage, but here we'll focus specifically on database-level practices and using Spring Data/JPA securely.)_

Spring Boot applications often use ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) like Hibernate (via Spring Data JPA) to interact with the database. ORMs can simplify database access and also help prevent SQL injection by using parameter binding. However, it's important to use them correctly and consider additional measures for security and performance.

### 5.1 Using ORMs and Spring Data JPA Securely

**Leverage Parameter Binding:** As discussed, prefer derived query methods or `@Query` with parameters in Spring Data. E.g., `findByEmail(String email)` or `@Query("... where u.email = :email")`. Spring will bind the `email` parameter safely ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=In%20Spring%20Boot%2C%20SQL%20Injection,parameterized%20queries%20or%20JPA%20repositories)). Avoid constructing JPQL or SQL by string concatenation with input. Even with JPA, if you do something like:

```java
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.name LIKE '%:name%'")
```

It might be tempting to not use `:name` properly – the correct way is `... WHERE u.name LIKE CONCAT('%', :name, '%')`. Or do filtering in memory if necessary after query.

**Beware of JPQL Injections:** While JPA repository methods handle things, if you use `EntityManager.createQuery("...")` manually, treat it like any SQL – use `setParameter`. The same goes for `createNativeQuery`.

**Validate Inputs Before Queries:** If an input is supposed to be numeric, ensure it is before using in a query, even if parameterized (just to avoid unnecessary exceptions or scanning). If an input controls a field name or sort order (dynamic queries), don't directly use user input to pick column names unless you validate it against an allowlist of known safe column names.

**Limit Data Exposure:** Use pagination (`Pageable`) for queries that return many rows to avoid denial-of-service by fetching giant result sets. Also to mitigate mass data exfiltration if injection did occur, implementing query limits helps ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=structure%20names%20are%20dangerous,in%20case%20of%20SQL%20injection)).

**Use Transactions Carefully:** Spring @Transactional ensures that either all DB changes in a unit succeed or fail together, which is good for data integrity. For security, one consideration is to avoid inconsistent state that an attacker could exploit (like partially applied changes). Typically not an issue if using transactions properly.

**Least Privilege DB User:** The database user used by the application should have only the necessary privileges. For example, if the app only needs to do SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE on certain tables, and never DDL (CREATE/DROP) in production, then don't use a superuser or root DB account. Configure a restricted user. This way, even if there is SQL injection, the damage might be limited (e.g., attacker cannot drop tables or create new accounts at the DB level if the user has no such rights).

**SQL Injection Recap:** Because this is so important: use prepared statements. If for some reason you need to execute dynamic SQL (e.g., building a custom report query with variable columns), consider using stored procedures or at least validate every piece of that dynamic query. But usually, Spring Data eliminates most of these cases.

**SQL Logging:** In dev, you might enable logging of SQL (spring.jpa.show-sql=true). Do not do this in production as it can log sensitive data (like the actual parameters). If you do need to log for audit, ensure it sanitizes or you explicitly remove sensitive fields from logs.

### 5.2 Preventing SQL Injection – Example

Let's illustrate a vulnerable versus safe approach in Spring:

**Vulnerable approach (for demonstration only):**

```java
// DO NOT USE - vulnerable example
public List<User> findUsersByName(String name) {
    String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '" + name + "%'";
    // if name is supplied as: a' OR '1'='1, the query becomes SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'a' OR '1'='1%', which is likely invalid but demonstrates how injection can break the query.
    return jdbcTemplate.query(sql, new UserRowMapper());
}
```

If `name` contains a quote, this will break the query or worse, allow tautologies.

**Secure approach:**

```java
public List<User> findUsersByName(String name) {
    String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE ?";
    return jdbcTemplate.query(sql, new UserRowMapper(), name + "%");
}
```

Now `jdbcTemplate` will set the parameter properly, handling any special characters. Or better:

```java
@Repository
interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    List<User> findByNameStartingWith(String prefix);
}
```

This uses a derived query method, which internally does the parameter binding for us, and is succinct.

In our guide references, OWASP suggests using ORM as a mitigation ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,escape%20special%20characters%20using%20the)) – indeed, writing high-level repository methods means you're not writing raw SQL at all in most cases.

### 5.3 Database Encryption and Data Integrity

We spoke in section 4.3 about encryption of sensitive fields. Implementing that ensures that even if someone gets direct DB access (or an old backup tape is stolen), they can't read sensitive data easily.

In addition to application-level encryption, consider **database-level security features**:

- **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):** Many DBs (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL enterprise, PostgreSQL) support TDE, which encrypts data files on disk. This protects against someone stealing the physical DB files. It doesn’t protect against a live compromise where queries can still retrieve data (since DB decrypts for the application).
- **Row-Level Security:** Some databases allow defining policies so that a DB user can only see certain rows (like adding an ownership filter). In a way, our application is already doing that with app logic, but in highly sensitive multi-tenant environments, you might put that logic in DB as a failsafe (e.g., PostgreSQL RLS). This can be complex but it's another layer.

- **Checksums/Hashing:** If concerned about data integrity (e.g., an attacker might modify data), you can store hashes or use DB constraints. Usually, if an attacker can modify the DB, you've got bigger issues. But for instance, storing a hash of critical fields in a separate secure place can help detect tampering.

**Preventing ORMs from leaking info:** Sometimes ORMs throw errors that include SQL or parameters (like if a query fails). Ensure such exception messages are not exposed to end-users (catch them or rely on Spring Boot’s error handling not to show SQL).

**Database Connection Security:** Use secure connections to the DB:

- If your DB is on another server, use SSL/TLS for the DB connection to prevent network sniffing (Spring Datasource can be configured with JDBC URL parameters for SSL, or use a VPN).
- Limit network exposure of DB: The DB server should ideally not be directly accessible to the internet, only the app server should talk to it (firewall rules, security groups, etc.).

By following these practices, our application’s interaction with the database will be both secure and robust:

- The ORM prevents injection by default (as long as we don't circumvent it).
- Sensitive data in the DB is encrypted or hashed, reducing the impact of a DB compromise.
- The app uses credentials that limit damage.
- Communication with the DB is secure.

In the upcoming case study, we'll use Spring Data JPA for all DB interactions to naturally avoid injection, and we'll ensure password hashing is applied. We'll mention how one could encrypt a field if needed (for demonstration, perhaps not fully implement due to complexity, but note it).

## 6. Secure Session Management and CSRF Protection

Session management and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) defense are closely related in the context of web applications that use sessions (typically with cookies for authentication). Let's address each:

### 6.1 Secure Session Management

Spring Boot applications using Spring Security automatically get a lot of session management best practices:

- **Session Fixation Protection:** Upon login, Spring Security will create a new `HttpSession` (invalidating the old one) by default, to prevent session fixation attacks (where an attacker sets a known session ID for a user before login).
- **HttpOnly Cookies:** The session cookie (JSESSIONID) is typically marked HttpOnly by the container, meaning client-side scripts cannot access it, reducing XSS stealing risk.
- **Secure Cookies:** If your site is HTTPS, ensure the `JSESSIONID` cookie has the Secure flag (Tomcat does this when connector is secure). If behind a proxy, you might need `server.servlet.session.cookie.secure=true` in properties to enforce it.
- **SameSite Cookies:** Newer practice is to set `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict` for session cookies to mitigate CSRF by default. In Spring Boot, you can configure this (since Spring Boot 2.1+, I believe) via properties:

  ```properties
  server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site=strict
  ```

  Using "Strict" means the session cookie won't be sent on cross-site requests at all, which significantly reduces CSRF risk (though it can interfere with some login flows if you need cross-site POST, but for most it’s fine). "Lax" is a balance (it will send cookies on top-level GET navigations but not on subresource or AJAX requests cross-site).

- **Session Timeout:** Set a reasonable session timeout (depending on app sensitivity). Spring Boot default might be 30 minutes. Perhaps shorten if sensitive and user inactivity should log them out. Configure via `server.servlet.session.timeout` property (e.g., `30m` for 30 minutes).

- **Limit Concurrent Sessions:** Spring Security can limit concurrent sessions per user. For example, ensure a user only has one active session at a time if required (this can be configured in `HttpSecurity.sessionManagement().maximumSessions(1)` etc.). This can prevent a stolen session cookie from being used if the user logs in again (the old session can be expired).

- **Session ID in URL:** Avoid URL rewriting (like `;jsessionid=...` in URLs). It's disabled by default if cookies are present, but just ensure your users are using cookies. URL-based sessions can leak in referer logs and are generally not safe.

- **Invalidate Session on Logout:** Spring Security's logout handler will invalidate the HTTP session by default. This is good. Also consider clearing any sensitive data from session before invalidation (just in case).

- **Don't Store Sensitive Data in Session:** Ideally, session holds only an identifier and minimal data (Spring Security stores principal info which is okay). Avoid putting things like plaintext passwords or large objects in session. If you have to store some user data in session (to avoid DB calls), be mindful of what's stored.

- **Testing Session Security:** It can be useful to test that session IDs change on login and logout, and that you cannot reuse an old session ID after logout (Spring should prevent that if invalidated).

In summary, trust Spring Security's defaults but verify or tweak them via configuration:

- HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies.
- SameSite attribute.
- Reasonable session timeout.
- Possibly enable session concurrency control.

For our case study, if we were to implement a form login, these would come into play. However, in an API with JWT scenario, sessions might not be used at all (which removes a lot of these concerns and also means CSRF is not applicable). We'll consider both scenarios.

### 6.2 CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection

**What is CSRF?** We explained earlier: it forces a victim’s browser to send a request (including their credentials like session cookie) to a website without their intent ([What is CSRF and how to prevent CSRF Attacks](https://escape.tech/blog/understanding-and-dealing-with-cross-site-request-forgery-attacks/#:~:text=CSRF%20is%20amongst%20the%20top,the%20user%20even%20knowing%20it)) ([What is CSRF and how to prevent CSRF Attacks](https://escape.tech/blog/understanding-and-dealing-with-cross-site-request-forgery-attacks/#:~:text=During%20the%20attack%2C%20a%20request,the%20victim%20and%20a%20legitimate)). Typically, an attacker crafts a hidden form or image tag on a malicious site that triggers a state-changing action on the target site where the user is logged in (e.g., fund transfer, password change). The user's browser automatically includes session cookies, so the target site thinks the request is authenticated.

**Spring Security's CSRF Protection:** Spring Security **enables CSRF protection by default** for web applications (if you're using `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` or not explicitly disabling it) ([Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) :: Spring Security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/exploits/csrf.html#:~:text=Spring%20Security%20protects%20against%20CSRF,configuration%20explicitly%20using%20the%20following)). This protection is implemented by requiring a unique token (XSRF-TOKEN) to be sent with state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). The server generates a CSRF token and stores it (in session or in a cookie), and the client must send it back, typically in a header or hidden form field. If the token is missing or doesn't match, the request is rejected.

Key points:

- **When to Enable/Disable CSRF:**
  - If your application is using cookie-based authentication (session or cookie tokens) and can be accessed by browsers, **keep CSRF protection enabled**. This will protect forms and AJAX calls from CSRF.
  - If your application is a pure token-based API (stateless, e.g., using JWT in Authorization header), you can disable CSRF because an attacker cannot force the victim's browser to add the Authorization header – it's not automatically included like a cookie. In our JWT scenario, CSRF isn't needed as long as cookies aren't used. Spring Security can be configured accordingly (it actually defaults CSRF protection to enabled only if the session management is in use).
- **How Spring Security Implements CSRF:** It uses a `CsrfTokenRepository`. By default, it stores the token in `HttpSession` and expects the token in a request header or parameter. Many setups use a cookie to share the CSRF token with the client (Double Submit Cookie pattern). Spring Security can be configured to put a CSRF token in a cookie (`CookieCsrfTokenRepository`). In our earlier config snippet, we had:

  ```java
  csrf().csrfTokenRepository(CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse());
  ```

  This sets a cookie `XSRF-TOKEN` (HttpOnly false so JavaScript can read it if needed to set header) and expects a header `X-XSRF-TOKEN` on the request with the token value.

- **Using CSRF Tokens in Forms/JS:** If you use Spring's form tag libraries in JSP or Thymeleaf, they automatically insert the CSRF token as a hidden field. If doing a fetch/AJAX, you need to read the token from cookie or meta tag and send it in a header. Many front-end frameworks have support for CSRF token handling when they detect the cookie.

- **Ensure SameSite isn't interfering:** If you set your session cookie SameSite=Strict, then CSRF attacks are largely mitigated because the browser won't send the session cookie on cross-site requests at all ([What is CSRF and how to prevent CSRF Attacks](https://escape.tech/blog/understanding-and-dealing-with-cross-site-request-forgery-attacks/#:~:text=)). But it's still fine to have CSRF tokens as a second layer. If SameSite=Lax, CSRF tokens are still needed for certain type of requests (like cross-site POST forms triggered by link).

- **Beware of Logout CSRF:** Without CSRF, even logout can be triggered by an attacker (which logs the user out unwittingly). Not the worst, but still undesirable. Spring's CSRF protection covers logout URL as well (requires token).

**Implementing CSRF in Spring Boot:**

In most cases, you don't have to do much beyond not disabling it. If you see code in guides that do `http.csrf().disable()`, know why you're disabling it. It's common in REST API scenarios or stateless service-to-service, but for web apps, don't disable it. The Medium post snippet we saw explicitly says "Verify it's not mistakenly disabled" ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=Cross,Verify%20it%27s%20not%20mistakenly%20disabled)) and warns to avoid `.csrf().disable()` in production.

If building a REST API for an SPA:

- If the SPA is on the same domain or uses the same cookies, treat it like a web app and use CSRF tokens.
- If the SPA uses JWT and no cookies, you can disable CSRF, as mentioned.

**Testing CSRF Protection:** Use a tool or write a small HTML page to simulate a cross-origin form submit and ensure it fails when CSRF token is missing or wrong. Check that legitimate requests with the token succeed.

**Additional CSRF Defense:** Setting SameSite=Strict on cookies as mentioned, or requiring some custom header that browsers won't send cross-site (which is essentially what CSRF token is).

One more scenario: **Socket connections or other stateful channels**. If you use WebSockets or SSE, consider authentication for those differently (e.g., a token in the connect request).

In our case study, if we illustrate a part with form submission (like user registration), we'll include how the CSRF token is included. If we focus on JWT for API, we'll mention that we disabled CSRF as not needed for that case.

## 7. Secure Logging and Error Handling

Proper logging and error handling are crucial for both security and maintainability. They ensure that you have insight into what's happening in your application without exposing sensitive information to attackers.

### 7.1 Secure Logging Practices

- **Log Security-Relevant Events:** As discussed in OWASP Top 10 item 10, log authentication attempts (especially failures), access control violations, important administrative actions, etc. Spring Security can generate events for us (authentication success/failure, access denied) which we can capture or rely on Actuator audit for.
- **Use a Standard Logging Framework:** Spring Boot uses Logback by default. Stick to using SLF4J API (`LoggerFactory.getLogger(...)`) in your code. Avoid printing to console or using System.out for anything significant (console is fine, but proper logger allows level control and better formatting).
- **Don't Log Sensitive Data:** Be very careful not to log things like:

  - Passwords or credit card numbers (even if user enters wrong password, don't log the actual password).
  - Session IDs or authentication tokens.
  - Personal data (unless absolutely needed for audit, and even then consider pseudonymizing).

  For example, if logging request input, you might want to mask or omit fields like passwords or SSNs. You can configure logging filters or use custom code to strip them.

- **Separate Logs and Use Levels:** Have different log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR). In production, DEBUG is usually off. Use INFO for general events, WARN for unusual situations, ERROR for failures/exceptions. This way you can adjust verbosity. Also consider separating security events into a separate log file for easier monitoring (Logback can have multiple appenders and filters, e.g., anything from the security package goes to a security.log).

- **Protect Log Files:** Ensure only authorized users (e.g., system admins) can read logs on the server. Logs can contain user data and internal info. If using a centralized system, that system should be secure and access-controlled.

- **Log Format:** Include timestamps, thread, and perhaps an identifier for each request (like a correlation ID) to trace flows. Spring Boot's default logback pattern is usually fine. You might integrate something like MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) to log the current user or request ID in each log entry for easier tracing in multi-user logs.

- **Avoid Log Injection:** This is a minor vector, but treat user input carefully if you ever log it. E.g., if you log raw headers or messages, an attacker could craft an entry that might fool log analyzers (like including newline characters). Most logging frameworks handle this (they strip or escape newlines by default). Just be aware not to blindly log structured entries in an insecure way. For example, printing a user input directly into logs that are later parsed could cause confusion.

- **Monitoring Logs:** Logging is only as useful as the monitoring around it. Use tools (Splunk, ELK, etc.) to set up alerts (ex: too many 5xx errors in a short time, indicates something broken or under attack; multiple failed logins for many users might indicate a credential stuffing attempt).

Spring Boot Actuator also provides some auditing. For instance, it can log when a user is authenticated or when an endpoint is accessed. The snippet from escape.tech:

```java
public class CustomAuditListener extends AbstractAuthenticationAuditListener {
    @Override
    public void onApplicationEvent(AbstractAuthenticationEvent event) {
         // Logging logic
    }
}
```

This shows you can hook into Spring Security events for custom logging ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=9,events)).

### 7.2 Error Handling and Exceptions

How you handle and return errors can affect security:

- **Don't Leak Internal Details:** Stack traces or error messages that reveal the technology, query, or code structure can help attackers. For example, a stack trace showing `org.hibernate.SQLGrammarException` reveals you're using Hibernate and maybe hints at a SQL issue (perhaps injection attempt succeeded partially). Always handle exceptions and return generic messages to users:

  - For API, you might return a JSON like `{"error":"Internal server error"}` with maybe an error code.
  - For web pages, show a friendly error page, not the default white-label error page with details (Spring's default error page shows the path and maybe an error message, which might be fine, but better to customize).
  - Configure `server.error.include-stacktrace=never` and similar properties to avoid sending stacktrace in response.

- **Global Exception Handler:** Use `@ControllerAdvice` with an `@ExceptionHandler` to catch exceptions and format a safe response. For example:

  ```java
  @ControllerAdvice
  public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
      @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
      public ResponseEntity<String> handleException(Exception ex) {
          // Log the exception with details for internal debugging
          logger.error("Unhandled exception", ex);
          // Respond with generic message
          return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                               .body("An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.");
      }
  }
  ```

  You can have specific handlers for known exceptions (e.g., EntityNotFound -> 404, AccessDenied -> 403 with maybe a custom message, etc.), and a fallback for general Exception.

- **Custom Error Pages:** Spring Boot allows a `error.html` template for generic errors. Or you can map errors in web.xml (but Boot simplifies via `ErrorController`). A custom error page can ensure the user sees something user-friendly and nothing sensitive. If it's an API, your `ErrorController` can produce a JSON format.

- **HTTP Status Codes:** Use correct codes. Do not, for example, return 200 OK with an error message in the body for an error – it may confuse clients or their security monitoring. Use 4xx for client errors (bad input, unauthorized, forbidden) and 5xx for server errors. This also integrates with security: e.g., Spring Security will send 401 for unauthenticated access by default, 403 for access denied. Keep those.

- **Prevent Information Disclosure via Errors:** Attackers often probe applications by sending bad requests to see error responses. If the error response is verbose (like includes the class name that threw exception or DB error), they gain knowledge. Ensure such probing yields minimal info. Example: sending a very large number where an int is expected – handle the NumberFormatException gracefully rather than letting a default error with possibly a stack trace through.

- **Audit Critical Failures:** If something like an authentication service or database is throwing exceptions that cause user requests to fail, log those at least WARN or ERROR with context (but again no sensitive data). This helps in diagnosing issues and detecting if perhaps there's an attack causing those (like someone intentionally sending payloads to break a parsing logic).

By implementing robust error handling, you give attackers little to work with, while still aiding developers/ops through logs. It's a balance: verbose to internal logs, concise to external output.

For our case study, we'll show how we might handle a couple of exceptions (like a custom exception when a record is not found, mapping it to 404, etc.) and ensure the response is clean. We'll also confirm that no sensitive info is returned.

### 7.3 Example: Logging and Error Handling in Practice

Suppose we have a secure event we want to log: an admin deletes a user account. In the code for that action, we could do:

```java
logger.info("Admin {} deleted user {} at {}", currentAdminUsername, deletedUsername, Instant.now());
```

This log gives a trail of what happened without exposing secrets (assuming usernames are not sensitive; if they are considered personal data, one might have to pseudonymize or ID them instead).

For error handling, suppose our service throws `InsufficientBalanceException` if a transfer amount is more than balance. We can catch that and:

```java
logger.warn("Transfer failed for user {} due to insufficient funds.", userId);
```

and return an error response like "Not enough balance". We wouldn't return details like "Balance is $50, tried to transfer $100" to the client, since that reveals the user's exact balance to maybe an attacker who triggers this.

One more note: consider integrating **security incident logging** separate from application logging. If something seriously wrong happens (multiple AccessDenied in short time, potential XSS attempt blocked, etc.), maybe log to a security-specific appender or even send alerts.

By following these, the application remains transparent enough to maintain but opaque to attackers trying to glean information.

## 8. Secure Deployment and DevSecOps Practices

Security isn't just in code – it extends to how you deploy and maintain the application. **DevSecOps** is about integrating security practices into DevOps processes. Here we'll highlight strategies for securely deploying our Spring Boot app and keeping it secure throughout its lifecycle.

### 8.1 Secure Deployment Strategies

- **Use Hardened Environments:** Whether you deploy on VMs, containers, or a cloud PaaS, ensure the underlying OS and environment is hardened:

  - Keep the OS updated (apply security patches regularly).
  - Remove or disable unnecessary services on the server.
  - Configure firewalls: Only expose the necessary ports (e.g., 443 for web, maybe 22 for SSH if needed).
  - If using containers (Docker): Use minimal base images (e.g., use an OpenJDK slim image, not a full OS). There are Java distroless images which have a very small attack surface. Also, don't run the app as root inside the container – create a user in Dockerfile and use it ([Advanced Spring Boot Security: Implementing OAuth2, JWT, and Custom Authentication – Code Frosting](https://www.codefro.com/2024/08/29/advanced-spring-boot-security-implementing-oauth2-jwt-and-custom-authentication/#:~:text=,in%20libraries%20like%20Spring%20Security)).

- **Environment Configuration:** Externalize configuration so that sensitive values are not in the code. Use Spring Boot profiles for prod vs dev. Ensure that in production profile:
  - Debugging is off.
  - Any dev-only endpoints (like H2 console or actuators) are disabled or secured.
  - Logging level is appropriate (no debug logging sensitive stuff).
  - CORS is configured for the actual allowed domains (not \* in prod).
- **Infrastructure as Code:** If you manage infrastructure with IaC (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.), include security in that – define security groups, ensure using secure AMIs, etc. This makes your deployment repeatable and security settings version-controlled.

- **TLS Certificates:** Manage certificates properly. Use letsencrypt or organization CA for HTTPS. Keep track of expiry. If deploying in containers, don't bake private keys into the image publicly; mount them via secrets.

- **Dependency and OS Vulnerability Scanning:** Before deploying, use tools to scan the built artifact or container for known vulnerabilities:

  - OWASP Dependency-Check (for the JAR).
  - Docker image scanning (Anchore, Trivy ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=7)), etc.) to catch vulnerable OS packages or libs.
    If something critical is found, address it before production.

- **Container Security:** If using Docker/Kubernetes:

  - Apply network policies to restrict pod communication if applicable.
  - Use read-only file systems for containers if possible, and do not run as root ([Advanced Spring Boot Security: Implementing OAuth2, JWT, and Custom Authentication – Code Frosting](https://www.codefro.com/2024/08/29/advanced-spring-boot-security-implementing-oauth2-jwt-and-custom-authentication/#:~:text=,in%20libraries%20like%20Spring%20Security)).
  - Limit memory/CPU to mitigate some DoS vectors.
  - Use K8s secrets or Vault for sensitive config, not environment variables in plain text in manifests (though env vars are slightly better than code, but still stored in etcd in k8s if not secrets).

- **Penetration Testing/Staging:** Have a staging environment that mirrors production, where you can run automated security tests (and maybe occasional manual pen tests) without risking prod data. Use OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite against your staging app to catch any obvious issues (like missing XSS protections, etc.) ([Advanced Spring Boot Security: Implementing OAuth2, JWT, and Custom Authentication – Code Frosting](https://www.codefro.com/2024/08/29/advanced-spring-boot-security-implementing-oauth2-jwt-and-custom-authentication/#:~:text=)).

### 8.2 Integrating Security in CI/CD (DevSecOps)

Embed security checks into your continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline:

- **Static Code Analysis (SAST):** Tools like SonarQube, Checkmarx, or Fortify can scan your code for vulnerabilities (e.g., usage of insecure functions). For example, SonarQube with FindSecBugs plugin can find common issues in Java code. Run these as part of CI and address high-severity findings.
- **Dependency Scanning (SCA):** As mentioned, have a step in CI to run dependency-check or Snyk on the project. Fail the build if any critical known vuln is present so developers address it early ([Securing Spring Boot Applications: Best Practices and Strategies.](https://medium.com/@shubhamvartak01/securing-spring-boot-applications-best-practices-and-strategies-3ab731f8b317#:~:text=Securing%20Spring%20Boot%20Applications%3A%20Best,can%20help%20identify%20vulnerable%20libraries)).
- **Container Scanning:** If building a Docker image in CI, run a scanner like Trivy in the pipeline (Trivy can scan OS packages and jar libs in the image).
- **Unit and Integration Tests for Security:** Write tests for your security configuration. E.g., test that restricted URLs indeed return 403 for normal users, test that an unauthenticated request to a secure endpoint gets 401, etc. Spring Security provides testing support (with `@WithMockUser` annotations, etc.) ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=9,events)).
- **Dynamic Testing (DAST):** Possibly automate OWASP ZAP to run in CI against a deployed test instance (some companies do nightly or weekly DAST scans).
- **Performance and Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz testing tools can send random inputs to find crashes. This can detect some security issues like certain injection or serialization issues causing crashes.

- **Build Artifact Signing:** When you build the JAR or Docker image, use checksums or sign them so that you know they haven't been tampered with in transit to production (especially if you use public artifact repositories). This is more supply-chain oriented.

- **Secrets in CI/CD:** Use CI/CD secret store (like Jenkins credentials, GitHub Actions secrets) rather than hardcoding any passwords/keys in pipeline scripts. And restrict who can access modify pipelines, since CI with secrets can be a target.

### 8.3 Runtime Security and Monitoring

Once deployed, maintain security:

- **Apply Patches:** Continuously update the application dependencies and redeploy as needed to patch vulnerabilities (this is easier if you integrated scanning to know when to update).
- **Monitor at Runtime:** Use APM and logs to detect anomalies. For instance, if suddenly CPU spikes and it might be due to crypto mining malware if someone exploited a flaw – you need monitoring to catch unusual behavior.
- **Incident Response Plan:** Have a plan if an incident occurs (whom to contact, how to rotate secrets, how to do forensic analysis). Regularly backup data (encrypted backups) so you can recover from events like ransomware or destructive attacks.
- **WAF/Cloud Security:** If applicable, use a Web Application Firewall or cloud security services (AWS WAF, Azure Front Door WAF, Cloudflare, etc.) in front of your app. They can block common attacks or DDoS before it hits your app. They are not foolproof but add a layer.

- **DevSecOps Culture:** Encourage developers to treat security as part of "definition of done". Code reviews should include a check for security issues. Provide training or resources to developers on secure coding. Perhaps maintain a checklist for new features (did we consider auth, validation, etc. for this feature?).

As an example, the escape.tech blog mentioned using an API security testing tool like Escape to scan endpoints quickly ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=A%20faster%20and%20more%20reliable,and%20see%20escape%20in%20action)). There are many such tools that integrate into CI.

By folding these practices into your pipeline, you catch issues early (shift-left security) and ensure your deployed app remains secure. It's far easier to fix a vulnerability in code before it's exploited in production.

For our case study, we'll assume a scenario where these practices are in place – e.g., we updated dependencies when Spring4Shell came out to a fixed version promptly ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=Spring%20Boot%20is%20widely%20used,a%20severe%20implications%20for%20organizations)), we run our tests including security tests, and we deploy on a hardened platform with TLS.

## 9. Case Study: Secure Spring Boot Application in Action

Let's bring it all together with a hypothetical **Secure Task Management** application. This will illustrate how we implement the discussed security principles in a real Spring Boot project.

**Scenario:** We are building a task management REST API (with a web UI possibly) where users can register, create tasks (to-do items), and an admin can manage all users and tasks. We'll implement:

- Secure user registration and login (with password hashing and JWT for API).
- Role-based access: Admin vs Regular User.
- Input validation on task data.
- Protection against OWASP Top 10 issues throughout.
- Secure logging of important events.

### 9.1 Project Setup Recap

We create a Spring Boot project with Spring Web, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, H2 (for simplicity in-memory DB for this case study), Lombok (for boilerplate reduction, optional).

In `application.properties` (for dev profile) we might have:

```properties
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:tasksdb
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=  # H2 default (empty)
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# Security
server.ssl.enabled=false  # (for dev only; in prod, we'd enable SSL)
server.error.include-message=never
server.error.include-stacktrace=never
```

In a prod profile, H2 console would be disabled, and we'd use a real database with credentials pulled from environment.

We also add a dependency for JWT (e.g., io.jsonwebtoken JJWT library) to sign and parse tokens.

### 9.2 Entity and Repository Design

**User Entity:**

```java
@Entity
public class AppUser {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    @Column(unique=true, nullable=false)
    private String username;
    @Column(nullable=false)
    private String password;  // hashed password
    private String role;      // "USER" or "ADMIN"
    // getters, setters, etc.
}
```

We keep it simple: username as unique, password hashed, role as string.

**Task Entity:**

```java
@Entity
public class Task {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    @NotBlank
    private String title;
    private String description;
    private boolean completed = false;
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="user_id")
    private AppUser owner;
    // getters, setters...
}
```

We annotate title with validation (@NotBlank). Each task is linked to an owner (the AppUser who created it).

**Repositories:**

```java
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<AppUser, Long> {
    Optional<AppUser> findByUsername(String username);
}

@Repository
public interface TaskRepository extends JpaRepository<Task, Long> {
    List<Task> findByOwnerUsername(String username);
    Optional<Task> findByIdAndOwnerUsername(Long id, String username);
}
```

The TaskRepository has a derived query to get tasks for a user and to get a task by id for a specific user (ensuring ownership).

### 9.3 Service Layer with Security Logic

We create a `UserService` to handle registration and perhaps load user details for Spring Security:

```java
@Service
public class UserService implements UserDetailsService {
    @Autowired private UserRepository userRepo;
    @Autowired private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    public AppUser registerUser(String username, String rawPassword) throws UserAlreadyExistsException {
        if(userRepo.findByUsername(username).isPresent()) {
            throw new UserAlreadyExistsException();
        }
        AppUser user = new AppUser();
        user.setUsername(username);
        user.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode(rawPassword));
        user.setRole("USER");
        return userRepo.save(user);
    }

    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        AppUser user = userRepo.findByUsername(username)
                   .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found"));
        // Convert to Spring Security's UserDetails
        return org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User.withUsername(user.getUsername())
                  .password(user.getPassword())
                  .roles(user.getRole())
                  .build();
    }
}
```

We throw a custom exception if trying to register an existing user (to avoid duplicate). Password is encoded with BCrypt. By default, BCryptPasswordEncoder uses a random salt and multiple rounds, which is aligned with OWASP recommendations ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=%2A%20Where%20possible%2C%20implement%20multi,based%20password%20policies)).

`TaskService` might handle creating and retrieving tasks:

```java
@Service
public class TaskService {
    @Autowired private TaskRepository taskRepo;
    @Autowired private UserRepository userRepo;

    public Task addTask(String username, String title, String description) {
        AppUser user = userRepo.findByUsername(username)
                     .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("User not found"));
        Task task = new Task();
        task.setTitle(title);
        task.setDescription(description);
        task.setOwner(user);
        return taskRepo.save(task);
    }

    public List<Task> getUserTasks(String username) {
        return taskRepo.findByOwnerUsername(username);
    }

    public Task updateTaskStatus(Long taskId, String username, boolean completed) throws AccessDeniedException {
        // Only owner can update their task (or admin, which we'll handle in controller perhaps)
        Task task = taskRepo.findByIdAndOwnerUsername(taskId, username)
                   .orElseThrow(() -> new AccessDeniedException("No access to task or not found"));
        task.setCompleted(completed);
        return taskRepo.save(task);
    }

    public void deleteTask(Long taskId, String username) throws AccessDeniedException {
        Task task = taskRepo.findById(taskId).orElseThrow();
        if(!task.getOwner().getUsername().equals(username)) {
            throw new AccessDeniedException("Not owner of task");
        }
        taskRepo.delete(task);
    }
}
```

We ensure only the owner can update or delete their task here. (Admins might have separate endpoints to manage anyone's tasks, which we'll allow via controller checks and using admin repository methods).

### 9.4 Security Configuration (JWT & OAuth2)

We configure Spring Security as per earlier plan:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableMethodSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Autowired private UserService userService;
    @Autowired private JwtFilter jwtFilter;

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }

    @Bean
    public AuthenticationManager authManager(AuthenticationConfiguration config) throws Exception {
        return config.getAuthenticationManager();
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()  // We disable CSRF since we use JWT for auth (stateless API)
            .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS).and()
            .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/api/auth/register", "/api/auth/login").permitAll()
                .requestMatchers("/h2-console/**").permitAll()  // permit H2 console for dev
                .requestMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            );
        http.headers().frameOptions().disable(); // for H2 console UI
        http.addFilterBefore(jwtFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
        return http.build();
    }
}
```

We permit `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login` for anyone (those will be handled in AuthController). Everything else requires auth, with admin endpoints locked to ADMIN role. We also disabled CSRF because this is a token-based API (no cookies for auth). If this app had a web login for the admin interface, we might enable CSRF there (maybe split config by path).

We include our `JwtFilter` as described earlier to intercept JWTs. We'll assume we wrote `jwtFilter` similar to the one in section 3.2, which uses a `JwtUtil` to validate tokens. The secret key for JWT is stored in `application.properties` as something like `jwt.secret=someRandomLongSecretValue` and `JwtUtil` reads it via `@Value`.

**JwtUtil example:**

```java
@Component
public class JwtUtil {
    @Value("${jwt.secret}")
    private String secret;
    private final long expirationMs = 3600000; // 1 hour

    public String generateToken(UserDetails userDetails) {
        Date now = new Date();
        Date exp = new Date(now.getTime() + expirationMs);
        return Jwts.builder()
                .setSubject(userDetails.getUsername())
                .claim("roles", userDetails.getAuthorities().stream()
                      .map(GrantedAuthority::getAuthority).collect(Collectors.toList()))
                .setIssuedAt(now)
                .setExpiration(exp)
                .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, secret)
                .compact();
    }

    public String extractUsername(String token) {
        return Jwts.parser().setSigningKey(secret)
                   .parseClaimsJws(token).getBody().getSubject();
    }
    public boolean validateToken(String token) {
        try {
            Jwts.parser().setSigningKey(secret).parseClaimsJws(token);
            return true;
        } catch(JwtException | IllegalArgumentException e) {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

This simple util signs and validates tokens. It doesn't handle things like token revocation or refresh, but it's sufficient for our case. We include roles in the token in case needed on client side (but we still enforce on server side from DB roles to be safe).

### 9.5 Controllers with Security Annotations

Now, define REST controllers:

**AuthController:**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/auth")
public class AuthController {
    @Autowired private UserService userService;
    @Autowired private AuthenticationManager authManager;
    @Autowired private JwtUtil jwtUtil;

    @PostMapping("/register")
    public ResponseEntity<?> register(@Valid @RequestBody RegisterRequest request) {
        try {
            userService.registerUser(request.getUsername(), request.getPassword());
            return ResponseEntity.ok("User registered successfully");
        } catch(UserAlreadyExistsException e) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CONFLICT).body("Username is taken");
        }
    }

    @PostMapping("/login")
    public ResponseEntity<?> login(@RequestBody LoginRequest request) {
        try {
            Authentication auth = authManager.authenticate(
                new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(request.getUsername(), request.getPassword()));
            UserDetails user = (UserDetails) auth.getPrincipal();
            String token = jwtUtil.generateToken(user);
            return ResponseEntity.ok(new JwtResponse(token));
        } catch(BadCredentialsException e) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED).body("Invalid username or password");
        }
    }
}
```

`RegisterRequest` and `LoginRequest` are simple DTOs with `username` and `password` fields (with validation annotations like @NotBlank). We handle duplicate user with 409 status. On login success, we return a JWT in a JSON body (we could also set it as a cookie if this were a web app, but as an API we typically return it and the client stores it).

**UserController (for normal user operations):**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/user")
public class UserController {
    @Autowired private TaskService taskService;

    @GetMapping("/tasks")
    public List<Task> getMyTasks(Authentication authentication) {
        String username = authentication.getName();
        return taskService.getUserTasks(username);
    }

    @PostMapping("/tasks")
    public ResponseEntity<Task> createTask(Authentication auth, @Valid @RequestBody TaskRequest taskReq) {
        String username = auth.getName();
        Task created = taskService.addTask(username, taskReq.getTitle(), taskReq.getDescription());
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(created);
    }

    @PutMapping("/tasks/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<?> markTaskDone(Authentication auth, @PathVariable Long id) {
        try {
            Task updated = taskService.updateTaskStatus(id, auth.getName(), true);
            return ResponseEntity.ok(updated);
        } catch(AccessDeniedException e) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN).body("You cannot modify this task");
        }
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/tasks/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<?> deleteTask(Authentication auth, @PathVariable Long id) {
        try {
            taskService.deleteTask(id, auth.getName());
            return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
        } catch(AccessDeniedException e) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN).body("You cannot delete this task");
        }
    }
}
```

Here we rely on `Authentication auth` injected, which Spring populates via the JWT filter. We trust `auth.getName()` (the username). We could also get `UserDetails` via `auth.getPrincipal()` if needed for roles, but here methods themselves are user-specific.

We use `@Valid` on the TaskRequest to ensure title is not blank and maybe length-limited. The service ensures the user exists and sets them as owner.

We catch AccessDeniedException from our service and return 403. Alternatively, we could annotate the service method with `@PreAuthorize` as another approach:

```java
@PreAuthorize("#username == authentication.name or hasRole('ADMIN')")
public Task updateTaskStatus(Long taskId, String username, boolean done) { ... }
```

But we already handle logic inside, so it's fine.

**AdminController (for admin operations):**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/admin")
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
public class AdminController {
    @Autowired private UserRepository userRepo;
    @Autowired private TaskRepository taskRepo;

    @GetMapping("/users")
    public List<AppUser> listUsers() {
        return userRepo.findAll();
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/users/{username}")
    public ResponseEntity<?> deleteUser(@PathVariable String username) {
        Optional<AppUser> userOpt = userRepo.findByUsername(username);
        if(userOpt.isEmpty()) {
            return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
        }
        AppUser user = userOpt.get();
        userRepo.delete(user);
        // Also delete their tasks
        taskRepo.deleteAll(taskRepo.findByOwnerUsername(username));
        return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
    }
}
```

We annotate the whole controller with `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` so every method requires admin. Alternatively, we already restricted `/api/admin/**` in WebSecurity config, so this is redundant but illustrative. The admin can list all users and delete a user (and their tasks). In real life, you might cascade tasks on user deletion or use database cascade, but here we manually do it.

**Important:** The admin deletion function should consider not deleting itself or something, but that's an edge-case logic detail.

We must ensure that admin endpoints cannot be accessed by non-admin: We have both the URL restriction and the @PreAuthorize, so it's doubly enforced.

### 9.6 Testing Security

Now, let's walk through how this design upholds security:

- **Registration**: Input validation ensures username/password are not empty or overly long. Password is immediately hashed ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,or%20a%20period%20of%20inactivity)) ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=the%20user%E2%80%99s%20private%20data,even%20if%20they%20were%20salted)). If a duplicate username is tried, we respond with 409 without revealing if the username existed or not (though by sending 409, we kind of do reveal that, but that's common and accepted for registration flows, as opposed to login where you wouldn't reveal user existence clearly). We could adjust to always return OK for registration and send an email to confirm, to avoid enumeration - but that's beyond scope.

- **Login**: On three failed attempts from same IP or same user, we could lock out or slow down (not implemented here due to complexity). But in logs, we would see multiple "Invalid username or password" from AuthController which we should log at WARN with username maybe (careful: if username might be an email, that's PII, but logging failed login attempts with the username is generally acceptable for security monitoring). Spring Security's internal logs or events could also be used ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=9,events)).

  If login succeeds, we generate a JWT with expiration (1 hour). We include roles in the token. The token is signed with our secret key (which is long and random enough, stored securely in config). We choose 1 hour expiration as a balance between user convenience and limiting token lifespan ([JWT Security Best Practices | Curity](https://curity.io/resources/learn/jwt-best-practices/#:~:text=short%20an%20expiration%20time%20for,valid%20for%20days%20or%20months)). For more security, we might only do 15 minutes and implement refresh tokens.

- **JWT usage**: The client (maybe a React app) stores the JWT (likely in memory or localStorage). With each API call, it adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. If someone somehow stole the token (XSS or packet if no HTTPS), they'd have access until it expires. Mitigation: short expiration, and we could also embed in the JWT some identifier that's tied to the user's device and check it (or just rely on short exp and user can revoke by changing password which could change a server-stored secret salt making existing tokens invalid). But our design is acceptable in typical JWT usage.

- **Access Control**: The JWT filter sets `SecurityContext` with user roles. So:

  - Normal users hitting their endpoints: The `UserController` methods use `auth.getName()` which comes from token and is secure. There's no way for a user to get another's data via these endpoints because:
    - `getMyTasks` uses their username only.
    - `updateTaskStatus` and `deleteTask` in service check the task's owner matches the username. If not, throw AccessDenied which yields 403.
    - They cannot call the admin endpoints because the filter will set them as USER role and the request to `/api/admin` will either be blocked by security config (403 Forbidden) or by @PreAuthorize (also 403).
    - They also cannot manipulate someone else's task by changing the ID in URL, because the service checks owner. For example, if user1 tries to mark task of user2 done, `taskRepo.findByIdAndOwnerUsername(id, user1)` returns empty, we throw AccessDenied. So Broken Access Control (IDOR) is prevented.
  - Admin users:
    - They can access admin endpoints because their JWT has role ADMIN, satisfying `hasRole('ADMIN')`.
    - They can list users (fine).
    - They can delete a user. Our implementation deletes the user and that user's tasks. We should consider if the user to delete is an admin themselves; currently nothing stops one admin from deleting another admin - that might be okay or not depending on policy. But from a security perspective, it's an authorized action since they are admin. If we wanted to prevent rogue admin actions, that's more an internal policy question (maybe require two admins, etc., beyond app scope).
    - On user deletion, since we cascade delete tasks, we avoid orphan sensitive data. Also, we might log this event as an audit: e.g., `logger.info("Admin {} deleted user {}", auth.getName(), username)` in that controller, to have a record ([Advanced Spring Boot Security: Implementing OAuth2, JWT, and Custom Authentication – Code Frosting](https://www.codefro.com/2024/08/29/advanced-spring-boot-security-implementing-oauth2-jwt-and-custom-authentication/#:~:text=)).

- **SQL Injection**: We used JPA repository methods and parameter binding everywhere. No string concatenation of untrusted input for queries. `findByOwnerUsername` and others use parameters safely. Thus, no SQL injection possible in our data layer ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=4)). If someone tried to trick via the username like setting username to something that includes a SQL wildcard, it will be treated as literal because our query is derived or uses `?`.

- **XSS**: Our API returns JSON, which doesn't execute in browsers by itself (unless someone does something odd like directly browsing the endpoint). We are not serving any HTML views in this case (except H2 console in dev). The main XSS risk would be if the client application does something unsafe with the data. For example, if the web UI takes the task title and sets it as innerHTML somewhere without escaping. That would be a client bug. On server side, to mitigate XSS in case some UI is directly rendering our outputs, we could ensure the task title doesn't contain scripts. We did not sanitize the `title` beyond @NotBlank and length possibly. We could add a regex to allow only letters, numbers and spaces in titles for extra safety (business decision). But at least we should document that the API will return whatever was input. If this were a concern, we could integrate an HTML sanitizer to strip script tags from descriptions, for example, if descriptions allowed HTML. Here, let's say we restrict description to plain text (no HTML allowed). In a richer app, we'd implement or use a library to strip disallowed HTML on input.

- **CSRF**: Since we opted for stateless JWT, CSRF is not an issue (no cookies). We disabled Spring’s CSRF protection explicitly. If we had a session-based login for, say, admin UI, we would enable CSRF tokens for those endpoints and ensure the admin UI includes them. But our scenario is more API-driven.

- **Sensitive Data Exposure**:

  - Passwords: never exposed (only stored hashed). We never return password fields in any JSON. The `AppUser` entity might, if directly serialized, show password. To avoid this, we should add `@JsonIgnore` on the password field or avoid returning AppUser objects directly. In AdminController, `listUsers()` returns `List<AppUser>` which by default would JSON-serialize all fields including password! That's not good. We should project only username and role. We can fix it by:
    - Adding `@JsonIgnore` on password in AppUser class, so it's not in output ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=the%20user%E2%80%99s%20private%20data,even%20if%20they%20were%20salted)).
    - Or create a DTO for output (UserDto with username and role).
    - For simplicity, let's mark password with @JsonIgnore. This way, even if admin lists users, the passwords aren't sent out. The admin doesn’t need to see hashes anyway.
  - Other sensitive info: Our data isn't very sensitive (tasks). If tasks had sensitive info, we'd consider encryption. For demonstration, we can consider description could sometimes have private info. We could encrypt description in DB using a JPA Converter as discussed, but then search would be hard. We'll skip actual encryption here but note that if we had PII in tasks, we'd do it.
  - Transport security: We assume when deployed, this runs over HTTPS. In dev, we disabled SSL for convenience. In production, you'd have server.ssl enabled with a certificate or run behind a proxy that terminates SSL. So no eavesdropping.
  - We also set `server.error.include-stacktrace=never`, so if any error bubbles up to Spring's error handling, it won't include stacktrace in the JSON (just message maybe). And we didn't include sensitive details in exception messages either.

- **Logging & Monitoring**:

  - We would have logs for key events: login attempts (Spring Security can log them, or we can log in AuthController for failures).
  - Important actions like user deletion we would log manually as shown.
  - We should also log unexpected errors: our global exception handler (if we add one) would log the exception stack for debugging, but send generic message to client.
  - We might add an AccessDeniedHandler to log when a user tried to do something forbidden, to catch any unusual activity.
  - If we had Actuator, we could use audit events feature. In production, we might enable Actuator endpoints like `/actuator/auditevents` which can show login events, etc., but that itself should be secured behind admin.

- **DevSecOps aspects**:
  - We manage dependencies in Maven; we'd use `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates` to check for updates periodically, or rely on Dependabot/GitHub alerts. For example, if a new Spring Boot patch fixes a security issue, we upgrade promptly.
  - Run OWASP Dependency-Check plugin in CI to catch known vulnerable libs.
  - Use JUnit tests to test that:
    - A user cannot get another user's task (simulate by creating tasks for two users and attempt with one JWT to get other's).
    - Endpoints require auth (an anonymous request to /api/user/tasks gets 401).
    - Admin endpoints reject normal user token.
    - CSRF: not applicable here, but if it was, a test that a request without token is 403.
  - Containerization: If we containerize, use a minimal JRE base image and run as non-root.

This case study, while simplified, shows how each layer (controller, service, repository) includes security considerations:

- **Controllers**: handle authentication (login) and input validation (@Valid), and restrict access either via annotations or by calling service methods appropriately.
- **Service**: enforces business security rules (ownership, etc.), uses safe repository methods.
- **Repository**: leverages ORM to avoid injection.
- **Security Config**: centralizes auth mechanisms (JWT filter, password encoder) and major access rules (URL restrictions).
- **Entities**: include validation annotations and avoid exposing sensitive fields (JsonIgnore).
- **Utilities**: for cryptography (JwtUtil) uses standard library (JJWT) with strong algorithms, and we keep secret keys out of code.

Finally, let's simulate a few requests to ensure everything:

- **User Registration & Login Flow:** Alice registers with password "secret". It's hashed and stored. She logs in, gets a JWT. The JWT might look like a long string (header.payload.signature). It contains "sub": "alice", "roles": ["ROLE_USER"], "exp": time. It's signed with server secret.
- **Task Operations:** Alice calls POST /api/user/tasks with her JWT and a JSON body `{"title":"Buy groceries","description":"Milk, Bread"}`. The JWT filter passes her through as authenticated user "alice". The controller calls taskService.addTask("alice", ...). Service finds AppUser from DB (exists). Saves Task with owner alice. Returns it. The JSON response includes id, title, description, completed, and owner (owner will be serialized fully if we allow it, which includes password which we ignored). Actually, to avoid sending entire owner object (which has password even if ignored), we might want to mark `Task.owner` with `@JsonIgnore` to prevent recursion or use DTOs. Simpler: mark owner with JsonIgnore, so the API does not send the whole user within each Task. The client can correlate tasks to user since it knows it's their tasks. For admin if they get tasks of others, they might need user info, but they can call the user API to get that by username. This is a design choice on how to present data; security-wise, including the owner's info in Task JSON isn't necessary and could leak user's hashed password if not careful. So we add `@JsonIgnoreProperties({"password","tasks"})` on the `owner` field or so.
- **Access Control:** Mallory (another user) tries to mark Alice's task complete by calling PUT /api/user/tasks/{id} with her JWT. The filter sets Mallory as auth, the service tries findByIdAndOwnerUsername(id, "mallory") – this returns empty (because owner is alice). It throws AccessDenied. We catch and return 403 "You cannot modify this task". Mallory is thwarted (Broken Access Control avoided).
- **SQLi test:** If someone tried a login with username `admin' --` and some password, our authentication queries the UserDetailsService which does userRepo.findByUsername("admin' --"). JPA will parameterize that behind the scenes (likely it will escape or parameterize properly such that it looks for a username literally equal to `admin' --`). It won't break the query. So safe.
- **XSS test:** If Alice creates a task with title `<script>alert(1)</script>`, our API stores it (we didn't forbid it). If later the front-end renders this title without escaping, an alert would pop. This is on the client. The API could choose to strip `<script>` tags. We might add a sanitize step: e.g., using Jsoup to remove tags from title. Alternatively, restrict title to not allow `<` by pattern. For demonstration, assume the client side handles it or that such input is unlikely. But it's a potential XSS if not handled. To be safe, we decide to restrict characters in title using a validation annotation: e.g., `@Pattern(regexp="^[A-Za-z0-9 _-]+$")` on title, meaning only letters, numbers, spaces, underscores, hyphens. That would block script tags (and also any punctuation not allowed). If we do that, any disallowed char will cause validation error 400, which is fine for a title field.

- **Sensitive data**: We ensured password never leaves server. Tasks might not be that sensitive. If they were, perhaps they'd be visible only to the user and maybe encrypted. But we've done enough for demonstration.

### 9.7 Summary of Applied Security Measures

Let's list how our case study addressed each OWASP Top 10 item:

- **Injection:** Used parameterized JPA queries, no dynamic SQL built from input. Validate inputs to avoid unexpected malformed data. (Prevents SQL injection, LDAP injection not relevant here).
- **Broken Auth:** Implemented Spring Security's framework for auth. Stored passwords with BCrypt (mitigating credential theft risk) ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=%2A%20Where%20possible%2C%20implement%20multi,based%20password%20policies)). Implemented JWT with strong secret and expiry (to handle session). No default accounts with weak passwords. Could improve by locking after failures or adding MFA for admin.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Enforced HTTPS (assumed). Passwords hashed (no plaintext). JSON does not include sensitive fields (password omitted). Could add encryption for particularly sensitive data if needed (not critical for tasks).
- **XXE:** Not applicable as we didn't parse XML from users. If we did (e.g., file upload of XML), we'd disable external entities. Our JSON parsing is safe with Jackson by default (no polymorphic issues since we don't use default typing).
- **Broken Access Control:** We used both role checks and ownership checks. Users cannot act as admins or access others' data. Admin routes secured. We deny any request that isn't allowed with proper 403 or 401. We followed "deny by default" – any URL not explicitly permitted requires auth ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,the%20data%20from%20other%20users)). Additionally, method-level checks on data ensure even if a URL was accessible, the data returned is only the user's.
- **Security Misconfiguration:** We turned off things like H2 console in production. We set appropriate settings (cookie flags, error info disabled). No default passwords or sample apps. Using frameworks' defaults (which are secure) and not overriding them insecurely. Our config is lean – we would remove H2 console completely in prod. The server doesn't reveal stack traces. We updated any library (assuming).
- **XSS:** We didn't generate HTML on server, but we did validate input and would sanitize if needed. Relying on the client to escape output is risky; we took step of not including malicious content by input pattern. Also, if we had a UI template, Spring would escape by default. We also could set Content-Security-Policy header in our SecurityConfig (not shown, but possible) to mitigate any XSS attempts on the client ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=context,from%20permitted%20content%20delivery%20networks)).
- **Insecure Deserialization:** We avoided using Java serialization or accepting any serialized objects. Everything is JSON and handled by Jackson safely. So no risk of RCE via deserialization here. We also didn't enable any funky serialization in user sessions or caching.
- **Using Known Vulns:** Suppose we depend on spring boot and jjwt etc. We would monitor and update. We took measures in DevSecOps to scan and update dependencies ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=,of%20a%20Website%20Application%20Firewall)). For instance, if a vulnerability in Spring Data JPA arises, we patch the version.
- **Insufficient Logging/Monitoring:** We added logging for important events (especially admin actions). We would enable Spring Security’s logging for auth failures. We set up a mechanism (in concept) to aggregate logs. We ensure we have alerts for multiple failed logins. We also audit admin actions. This would help detect an attack or misuse. Logging framework ensures logs are stored and not lost. We also would monitor the application with an APM or at least metrics (Actuator could be used to track unusual throughput or errors).

By implementing the above, our application is **significantly hardened** against common attacks. There is always more that can be done (e.g., content security policy, advanced rate limiting, etc.), but we struck a balance suitable for an advanced developer to maintain.

## Conclusion

Building a secure Spring Boot application requires careful attention at every layer: from configuring the framework correctly, writing secure code, to deploying in a secure environment. In this guide, we covered how to set up Spring Boot with a security-first approach, mitigate each OWASP Top 10 vulnerability with concrete measures, implement robust authentication and authorization with Spring Security (including modern JWT-based stateless auth), enforce validation and encoding to thwart injection and XSS, secure data handling in the database, manage sessions and CSRF tokens to protect web interactions, and adopt logging, monitoring, and DevSecOps practices to maintain security over time.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Rely on Proven Frameworks:** Spring Security provides many defenses out-of-the-box (CSRF protection, session fixation prevention, password encoding) – use them instead of custom solutions ([Features :: Spring Security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/features/index.html#:~:text=Spring%20Security%20provides%20comprehensive%20support,libraries%20to%20simplify%20its%20usage)).
- **Shift Security Left:** Incorporate security in design and development, not just as an afterthought. Validate inputs and design APIs with least privilege from the start.
- **Defense in Depth:** Apply multiple layers of security. For example, even though we use JWT (preventing CSRF inherently), we still validate user input and roles on the server, just in case.
- **Stay Updated:** Keep dependencies updated and monitor for new vulnerabilities in the libraries and platform ([10 best practices to secure your Spring Boot applications](https://escape.tech/blog/security-best-practices-for-spring-boot-applications/#:~:text=7)). Use tools to automate this where possible.
- **Secure the Deployment:** The most secure code can be undermined by an insecure server config. Use HTTPS, secure cookies, environment-based config, and hardened containers/VMs. Integrate security checks into CI/CD so that security is continuously validated.
- **Monitor and Respond:** Implement thorough logging and monitoring. Know when something goes wrong via alerts. Regularly review logs or use automated systems to detect anomalies ([OWASP Top 10 Security Risks & Vulnerabilities 2020 | Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/#:~:text=Not%20having%20an%20efficient%20logging,damage%20of%20a%20website%20compromise)).
- **Practice and Improve:** Regularly perform security testing (automated scans, and maybe periodic pen-tests). Threat-model new features to see how they might be attacked and ensure defenses are in place (for example, if we added file uploads feature, we'd consider virus scanning, path validation to avoid directory traversal, etc.).

By following the principles and examples in this guide, advanced developers can significantly reduce the risk of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in their Spring Boot applications. Security is an ongoing process, but with a solid foundation and DevSecOps culture, your application can stay one step ahead of threats.
