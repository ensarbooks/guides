# Developing a Chrome Extension to Extract LinkedIn Profile Information: Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

### Overview of Chrome Extensions

Chrome extensions are small software programs that extend and customize your web browsing experience ([What are extensions?  |  Manifest V2  |  Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/overview#:~:text=Extensions%20are%20small%20software%20programs,as%20HTML%2C%20JavaScript%2C%20and%20CSS)). They are built using familiar web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) and allow you to tailor Chrome’s functionality to your needs. An extension typically serves a single, focused purpose (for example, modifying a webpage or adding a browser button) and can consist of multiple components that work together (like background scripts, content scripts, and user interface elements). In this guide, we will leverage these capabilities to build an extension that extracts information from LinkedIn profile pages.

### Ethical Considerations and LinkedIn’s Terms of Service

Before diving in, it’s crucial to address ethics and legality. **LinkedIn’s Terms of Service explicitly forbid** unauthorized automated scraping of its platform ([The Fine Line of LinkedIn Data Scraping: Legality, Consequences, and Best Practices | Engage AI](https://engage-ai.co/linkedin-data-scraping-legality-consequences-best-practices/#:~:text=The%20Legal%20Landscape)). While web scraping public data isn’t outright illegal, using automation on LinkedIn without permission can violate their terms and risk your account. LinkedIn actively employs detection mechanisms to guard against scraping – for instance, viewing too many profiles too quickly can trigger anti-scraping “alarm bells” on their end ([The Fine Line of LinkedIn Data Scraping: Legality, Consequences, and Best Practices | Engage AI](https://engage-ai.co/linkedin-data-scraping-legality-consequences-best-practices/#:~:text=While%20scraping%20LinkedIn%20can%20yield,set%20off%20LinkedIn%E2%80%99s%20alarm%20bells)). **Always** ensure you have permission to use the data you collect, respect privacy, and avoid excessive or harmful scraping. This guide is for educational purposes and personal use; if you deploy such an extension, do so responsibly and in accordance with LinkedIn’s policies.

## Setting Up the Chrome Extension

### Project Structure and Manifest File

Every Chrome extension starts with a well-defined project structure. At minimum, create a new folder for your extension and inside it prepare a **`manifest.json`** file (the extension manifest). The manifest is a JSON configuration that describes your extension’s properties and capabilities to Chrome (name, version, what files to load, permissions, etc.). For our LinkedIn scraper, the project structure will look something like this:

```
linkedin-scraper-extension/
├── manifest.json
├── contentScript.js
├── popup.html   (optional UI)
├── popup.js     (optional UI script)
└── icons/       (optional icons)
```

In the manifest, we specify basic info (like name and version) and crucially, we define a **content script** that will run on LinkedIn pages. A content script is a JavaScript file that Chrome will inject into web pages matching specified URLs. For example, to run `contentScript.js` on LinkedIn profile pages, your manifest might include:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "LinkedIn Profile Scraper",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Extracts profile info from LinkedIn pages",
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://www.linkedin.com/*"],
      "js": ["contentScript.js"]
    }
  ],
  "host_permissions": ["https://www.linkedin.com/*"],
  "permissions": []
}
```

In the snippet above, `"matches": ["https://www.linkedin.com/*"]` tells Chrome to inject our script into any LinkedIn page. We also include `"host_permissions"` for the LinkedIn domain (required in Manifest V3) and can list general extension permissions under `"permissions"`. The manifest configuration may vary based on needs, but it will be similar to the example shown here ([Mastering LinkedIn Data Extraction: Build a Chrome Extension to Scrape User Details — An Advanced Guide | by Simuratli | Level Up Coding](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/mastering-linkedin-data-extraction-build-a-chrome-extension-to-scrape-user-details-an-advanced-b8a1a15cbfd8#:~:text=,cookies)). Remember that **every extension needs a manifest** to function; this file is essentially the blueprint of your extension.

### Permissions Required for Data Extraction

Chrome extensions operate under the principle of least privilege, so you must declare any special permissions your extension needs in the manifest. For a LinkedIn scraping extension, required permissions might include:

- **Host permissions** for LinkedIn: As seen above, we declare access to `https://www.linkedin.com/*` so our content script can run on those pages ([Mastering LinkedIn Data Extraction: Build a Chrome Extension to Scrape User Details — An Advanced Guide | by Simuratli | Level Up Coding](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/mastering-linkedin-data-extraction-build-a-chrome-extension-to-scrape-user-details-an-advanced-b8a1a15cbfd8#:~:text=,cookies)).
- **activeTab (optional)**: This permission grants temporary access to the currently active tab when the user invokes the extension (for example, by clicking a browser action). In our case, if we choose to only run the scraping on demand (when the user clicks a button), the `activeTab` permission could be used instead of always injecting the content script.
- **Storage (optional)**: If you plan to save data using Chrome’s storage API (to store scraped info or user preferences), you should include the `"storage"` permission. Chrome’s Extension Storage API is available to extensions to save data and is more appropriate than using web page localStorage ([Extensions / Develop  |  Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop#:~:text=Chrome%20Extensions%20have%20a%20specialized,tracks%20whenever%20data%20is%20updated)).
- **Downloads (optional)**: If you want to automatically save the extracted data as a file to the user’s computer (e.g. a CSV), you’ll need the `"downloads"` permission to use the `chrome.downloads` API ([Extensions / Develop  |  Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop#:~:text=Manage%20downloads)).
- **Scripting or Tabs (Manifest V3)**: In Manifest V3, if you programmatically inject scripts, you might use the `"scripting"` permission. Also, the `"tabs"` permission can be useful for interacting with or obtaining info about browser tabs (though it’s not strictly required just to inject a content script declared in the manifest).

It’s good practice to **only request the minimum permissions necessary**. Not only does this reduce security risks, but it also makes your extension compliant with Chrome Web Store policies and more trustworthy to users ([ How to Publish Your Chrome Extension on the Chrome Web Store - DEV Community](https://dev.to/artem_turlenko/how-to-publish-your-chrome-extension-on-the-chrome-web-store-3p3e#:~:text=%2A%20Manifest%20%26%20Permissions%3A%20Double,with%20compliance%20with%20Chrome%E2%80%99s%20policies)). For example, if you decide to auto-inject your content script via the manifest (which we do above), you might not need `"activeTab"` at all – so you can omit it. Double-check your `manifest.json` and remove any permissions that aren’t needed for your functionality ([ How to Publish Your Chrome Extension on the Chrome Web Store - DEV Community](https://dev.to/artem_turlenko/how-to-publish-your-chrome-extension-on-the-chrome-web-store-3p3e#:~:text=%2A%20Manifest%20%26%20Permissions%3A%20Double,with%20compliance%20with%20Chrome%E2%80%99s%20policies)).

With the folder, manifest, and at least a content script file ready (we will fill in the content script code in a later section), your basic extension setup is done. Next, we’ll explore how LinkedIn pages are structured so we know what to target in our scraper.

## Understanding LinkedIn’s Structure

### How LinkedIn Profiles Are Structured in HTML

LinkedIn’s profile pages are essentially regular web pages, but they are part of a modern single-page application (SPA). This means that much of the content is dynamically loaded via JavaScript as you navigate, rather than through full page reloads. In practical terms, when you click to view a profile on LinkedIn, the page may update content without a full refresh, using background AJAX calls. As a result, **the DOM (Document Object Model) of a profile page is populated on the fly**, and certain elements might not be present immediately on initial load or might change when you scroll or click sections. In fact, if you start from the LinkedIn homepage and navigate to a profile, the site often just injects the profile content into the current page (common in SPAs) ([Hacking LinkedIn search results with a Chrome Extension — Milestone #3 | by Valentin Palussière | codeburst](https://codeburst.io/hacking-linkedin-search-results-with-a-chrome-extension-milestone-3-1be44d835059#:~:text=So%2C%20translating%20to%20our%20use,model%20of%20Single%20Page%20Application)). This has two implications for us:

1. Our content script might need to handle the possibility that elements take some time to load or that navigation within LinkedIn doesn’t trigger a fresh content script injection. We’ll address strategies for this in the extraction section (like waiting for content or reacting to URL changes).
2. We should identify stable anchors in the HTML to reliably find the data we want. LinkedIn’s developers do not provide an official API for scraping profile data (for obvious reasons), and they frequently change the HTML structure and class names. However, certain structural markers (like specific element types or IDs) can be used. For example, the profile page is divided into sections – a top section for the user’s name, headline, and location, and subsequent sections for “About”, “Experience”, “Education”, etc. Many of these sections have unique IDs in the HTML, such as `id="experience-section"` for the experience list, `id="education-section"` for education, and so on ([python - HTML tags changes during web scraping LinkedIn using Selenium and BeautifulSoup - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75773779/html-tags-changes-during-web-scraping-linkedin-using-selenium-and-beautifulsoup#:~:text=experience%20%3D%20soup.find%28%22section%22%2C%20%7B%22id%22%3A%20%22experience)). These IDs can serve as reliable hooks to find those sections regardless of class name changes.

It’s important to note that **LinkedIn’s HTML and classes can change over time**. A scraper that works today might break if LinkedIn updates their site (for example, renaming a CSS class or changing the layout) ([GitHub - jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension: A chrome extension to scrape linkedin profiles](https://github.com/jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension#:~:text=Note)). Therefore, designing your extension in a way that makes it easy to update the selectors (the DOM queries) is wise. We will keep our scraping logic centralized so that if LinkedIn’s structure shifts, we can adjust a few query selectors to fix it.

### Identifying Key Profile Elements

Now, let’s break down the key elements of a LinkedIn profile page we want to extract, and how they appear in the DOM:

- **Name** – The full name of the person is typically contained in an `<h1>` element near the top of the profile page. In the current LinkedIn UI, this `<h1>` is within a section that might have classes like `pv-text-details__left-panel` or similar. For instance, the HTML may look like: `<div class="pv-text-details__left-panel"><div>...<h1>Person’s Name</h1></div></div>`. In our content script, we can target this by looking for the `<h1>` tag on the page, or a more specific selector if necessary. (There is usually only one `<h1>` on a profile – the name – so `document.querySelector('h1')` is a quick way to get it.)
- **Headline (Job Title / Position)** – This is the text right below the name, which often shows the person’s current title and company, or a headline they wrote about themselves. In HTML, this is often in a `<div>` or `<h2>` element with a class like `text-body-medium break-words` (one of LinkedIn’s utility class combinations for that text) ([linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension/popup.js at main · jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension · GitHub](https://github.com/jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension/blob/main/popup.js#:~:text=name%3A%20%27div.mt2.relative%20%3E%20div%3Anth,child%281%29%20%3E%20h1)). For example, one scraper found the headline in a `div` with class `"text-body-medium break-words"` containing the text of the headline. We can use a selector for that class or a relative selector (e.g., “the first `<h2>` or `<div>` after the name header”).
- **Location** – The user’s location (and possibly industry) appears as a small text under the headline. It may be within a `<span>` element with classes like `text-body-small t-black--light break-words` ([linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension/popup.js at main · jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension · GitHub](https://github.com/jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension/blob/main/popup.js#:~:text=location%3A%20%27div.mt2.relative%20%3E%20div.pb2.pv,words)) (denoting a small, grey text). We can target that span by its class or by its position in relation to the name/headline.
- **About (Summary)** – If the user has written an “About” section, it appears in a collapsible block. Initially only the first few lines may be shown, with a “See more” link to expand it. The HTML for the “About” text might have a class like `inline-show-more-text` and resides in a `<section>` for the “About” section. We’ll need to click the “See more” button to get the full text (more on that in extraction).
- **Experience** – This section lists current and past positions. In HTML, it’s a `<section id="experience-section">` containing a list (`<ul>`) of `<li>` items, each representing a job or role ([python - HTML tags changes during web scraping LinkedIn using Selenium and BeautifulSoup - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75773779/html-tags-changes-during-web-scraping-linkedin-using-selenium-and-beautifulsoup#:~:text=experience%20%3D%20soup.find%28%22section%22%2C%20%7B%22id%22%3A%20%22experience)). Each job entry typically includes the job title (often in an `<h3>` tag), the company name (in a `<p>` tag or another `<h4>`), dates (within `<h4>` or `<span>` tags), and description. LinkedIn sometimes groups multiple roles at the same company under one company header – those appear as nested lists within the experience section. Identifying experience entries may involve looking for specific classes (for example, one known class for job titles is `pv-entity__summary-info` or related). We can also simply select all list items under `#experience-section ul` to get each experience.
- **Education** – Similarly, the education section is typically `<section id="education-section">` with a list of education entries (schools, degrees). Each entry might have the school name in an `<h3>` and degree details in `<p>` tags, etc.
- **Other Sections** – There are other sections like “Skills”, “Licenses & Certifications”, “Volunteer Experience” etc. For the scope of this guide, we’ll focus on the main personal info, headline, experience, and education, but the same principles apply to any section: find a unique container (by id or other attribute) and then drill down to the details you need.

To discover these elements, use Chrome’s **Developer Tools (Inspect Element)** on a LinkedIn profile page. By inspecting the DOM, you can find the exact tags and classes. For example, using DevTools, you might see something like:

```html
<h1 class="text-heading-xlarge inline t-24 v-align-middle break-words">
  John Doe
</h1>
<div class="text-body-medium break-words">Senior Engineer at TechCorp Inc.</div>
<span class="text-body-small inline t-black--light break-words"
  >San Francisco Bay Area</span
>
```

These correspond to the name, headline, and location respectively (class names may differ slightly, but the structure is as above). Indeed, in one open-source scraper, the selectors used were: `h1` for name, `div.text-body-medium.break-words` for headline, and a `span.text-body-small.t-black--light.break-words` for location ([linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension/popup.js at main · jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension · GitHub](https://github.com/jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension/blob/main/popup.js#:~:text=name%3A%20%27div.mt2.relative%20%3E%20div%3Anth,child%281%29%20%3E%20h1)). Knowing this structure, we can confidently write DOM queries in our extension to extract each piece of information.

## Extracting Profile Data

### Using JavaScript and DOM Manipulation to Scrape Data

With our content script running on the profile page, we can use plain JavaScript DOM APIs to grab the information. The content script operates as if it’s part of the page, so `document` refers to the LinkedIn profile’s DOM. We will use methods like `document.querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` to find elements.

**Basic extraction example:** In `contentScript.js`, we can retrieve the name and headline as follows:

```js
// contentScript.js

// Get the name element (h1 tag) and extract text
const nameElement = document.querySelector("h1");
const name = nameElement ? nameElement.innerText.trim() : "";

// Get the headline element (div with specific classes) and extract text
const headlineElement = document.querySelector(
  "div.text-body-medium.break-words"
);
const headline = headlineElement ? headlineElement.innerText.trim() : "";

// Get the location element (span with specific classes) and extract text
const locationElement = document.querySelector(
  "span.text-body-small.t-black--light.break-words"
);
const location = locationElement ? locationElement.innerText.trim() : "";

// Log the results (or store them for later use)
console.log("Name:", name);
console.log("Headline:", headline);
console.log("Location:", location);
```

In the code above, we used selectors based on the classes we observed. We included `.trim()` to remove any extra whitespace/newlines from the text. The optional chaining (`?.`) or conditional checks ensure we don’t get errors if an element isn’t found. This approach is straightforward: for each piece of data, find the corresponding element and get its `innerText`.

([linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension/popup.js at main · jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension · GitHub](https://github.com/jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension/blob/main/popup.js#:~:text=const%20elementNameProfile%20%3D%20document))In a reference implementation of a LinkedIn scraper, the content script followed a similar pattern – querying the DOM for name, title, location, etc., and retrieving the text content. Once you have the raw text, you can structure it as needed (e.g., form an object like `{ name, headline, location, experience: [...] }`).

**Extracting list data (Experience, Education):** For sections like experience, where there are multiple entries, you’d use `document.querySelectorAll()` to get all matching elements. For example:

```js
// Example: Extract all job titles in the Experience section
const experienceItems = document.querySelectorAll(
  "#experience-section ul > li"
);
experienceItems.forEach((item) => {
  const jobTitleElem = item.querySelector("h3");
  const companyElem = item.querySelector("p.pv-entity__secondary-title");
  const dateRangeElem = item.querySelector(
    "h4.pv-entity__date-range span:nth-child(2)"
  );
  const descriptionElem = item.querySelector("p.pv-entity__description");
  let jobTitle = jobTitleElem ? jobTitleElem.innerText.trim() : "";
  let company = companyElem ? companyElem.innerText.trim() : "";
  let dates = dateRangeElem ? dateRangeElem.innerText.trim() : "";
  let description = descriptionElem ? descriptionElem.innerText.trim() : "";
  // Store or output these details...
});
```

The above is an illustrative example – the selectors combine IDs, element types, and classes to navigate the nested structure. We look for each `<li>` in the experience list, then within each item, find specific sub-elements (like the job title in an `<h3>` and company in a `<p>`). These selectors might need adjustment depending on LinkedIn’s current DOM, but the idea is to traverse the DOM tree for each experience entry.

### Handling Dynamically Loaded Content

LinkedIn often hides or lazy-loads parts of the profile content. Two common cases to handle are:

1. **“See more” buttons for expanded content:** The “About” section and long experience descriptions might be truncated by default. You’ll notice a “...see more” link or button. To scrape the full content, your script should simulate a click on these before grabbing text. For instance, if the “About” section has a “see more” link, you can do something like:

```js
const seeMoreButtons = document.querySelectorAll(
  ".pv-profile-section__see-more-inline, .inline-show-more-text__see-more"
);
seeMoreButtons.forEach((btn) => btn.click());
```

This tries to click any “see more” buttons for experience or about sections. Make sure this runs before you extract the text from those sections, and perhaps give the page a moment to load the new content (you can use a `setTimeout` of a second or use a MutationObserver to detect the new content). In our reference code, they specifically clicked the “see more” in the Experience section if it was present ([linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension/popup.js at main · jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension · GitHub](https://github.com/jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension/blob/main/popup.js#:~:text=const%20clickOnMoreResume%20%3D%20async%20,)).

2. **Single Page Application navigation:** As discussed, if a user navigated to a profile without a full reload, our content script (if only injected on page load) might not run. To handle this, you have a few options:
   - Eager approach: Use a broad match pattern (`"matches": ["https://www.linkedin.com/*"]`) so that your content script runs on many pages (including when the user first lands on LinkedIn). The script can then detect if it’s on a profile page by checking `window.location` or the presence of specific profile DOM elements, and only run the scraping logic at the appropriate time.
   - Use the **`chrome.webNavigation` API** in the background. This allows your extension to listen for history changes in the tab. LinkedIn updates the URL (to something like `.../in/username`) when navigating to a profile. By listening to `onHistoryStateUpdated` events for LinkedIn URLs, your background script could manually inject the content script at that moment ([Hacking LinkedIn search results with a Chrome Extension — Milestone #3 | by Valentin Palussière | codeburst](https://codeburst.io/hacking-linkedin-search-results-with-a-chrome-extension-milestone-3-1be44d835059#:~:text=chrome.webNavigation.onHistoryStateUpdated.addListener%28%20function%20%28event%29%20,)). This is a bit advanced, but it’s a robust solution to ensure your script runs even in SPA navigation scenarios.
   - Advise the user to refresh the page when on a profile (simplest workaround if not coding a dynamic solution). If the extension icon action triggers a reload of the content script, that can get around the SPA issue.

For a beginner-friendly implementation, you might choose simplicity: have the content script always run on LinkedIn pages and within it, check if `document.querySelector('h1')` exists (indicating a profile). If not, do nothing. This way, if the user navigates to a profile in the same tab, you may need them to refresh once for the script to catch on. It’s not perfect, but it’s easier to implement. As you get more comfortable, you can refine this with the techniques above.

### Avoiding Detection by LinkedIn

Our extension will operate client-side (in the user’s browser) and only read data the user can already see, which is generally hard for LinkedIn to detect compared to server-side scraping. However, if you automate this extension to scrape many profiles quickly, you could still run into issues. Here are some tips to stay under the radar:

- **Do not excessively crawl profiles**: If you plan to scrape multiple profiles, consider adding delays between actions or requiring a manual click for each profile’s data extraction. This ensures you mimic normal browsing behavior. LinkedIn flags accounts that perform actions at superhuman speed or volume ([The Fine Line of LinkedIn Data Scraping: Legality, Consequences, and Best Practices | Engage AI](https://engage-ai.co/linkedin-data-scraping-legality-consequences-best-practices/#:~:text=While%20scraping%20LinkedIn%20can%20yield,set%20off%20LinkedIn%E2%80%99s%20alarm%20bells)), so keeping the pace human-like is important.
- **Limit data requests**: Since our approach just reads the already-loaded page, we’re not making additional requests to LinkedIn’s servers except perhaps clicking the “see more” (which is something a normal user would do). Avoid trying to call LinkedIn’s private APIs or loading hidden data – that’s more detectable. Stick to what’s in the DOM.
- **Use the extension only when needed**: Instead of having it automatically scrape every profile you visit, you might design it to activate only when you click a button (this ties in with the UI discussion below). That way, you’re deliberately choosing when to scrape, reducing unintended bulk actions.

Finally, always be mindful of LinkedIn’s terms: data you collect should not be misused. If this is for personal use (e.g., backing up your connections’ info or doing research on a small scale), you’re less likely to run afoul of issues. In contrast, using this extension to scrape hundreds of profiles for marketing without LinkedIn’s consent could lead to your account being restricted. **Use responsibly!**

## Storing and Exporting Data

### Saving Data in Local Storage or a Database

Once your content script has gathered the profile information, you’ll likely want to store it somewhere for the user to use. There are a few approaches:

- **Immediate use (no long-term storage)**: If your goal is just to grab data and immediately export it (e.g., download a file or copy to clipboard), you might not need to store it at all. The content script can simply gather the data and pass it to the next step (like creating a file).
- **Chrome Extension Storage**: Chrome provides a built-in storage API for extensions, offering both local and sync (cloud-synced) storage options ([Extensions / Develop  |  Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop#:~:text=Chrome%20Extensions%20have%20a%20specialized,tracks%20whenever%20data%20is%20updated)). You can use `chrome.storage.local.set` to save data (like an array of scraped profiles) and `chrome.storage.local.get` to retrieve it. This is sandboxed storage just for your extension, and doesn’t expire unless you remove the extension or clear it. For example, after scraping, you could do:
  ```js
  chrome.storage.local.set({ latestProfile: profileData });
  ```
  to save the data object. This requires the `"storage"` permission as mentioned earlier.
- **Background Script or In-Memory**: Another pattern is to send the data from the content script to a background script (or service worker in Manifest V3) via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` or `chrome.tabs.sendMessage`. The background script could accumulate data from multiple profiles in a list. This would survive while the extension is running, but if the browser is closed, you’d lose it unless you saved it to `chrome.storage` or a file.
- **External Database or Server**: This is advanced and usually not necessary for a simple extension, but you could send data to a remote server via an HTTP request. Be cautious: this raises privacy/security concerns and would require declaring permissions for external hosts, and may violate policies if not transparently done. For our purposes, we’ll stick to local storage or file export.

For a beginner-friendly solution, using **Chrome’s local storage API** is convenient. It’s essentially like using `localStorage` but made for extensions (accessible through the `chrome.storage` API). You don’t have to worry about database setup or expiration. Keep in mind that if you plan to collect multiple profiles and then export them all at once, you should store them (e.g., push each profile’s data into an array in storage).

### Exporting Data to CSV or JSON Files

After extracting the profile information, users will want to make use of it outside the extension. Two common formats are **CSV** (for spreadsheets) and **JSON** (for structured data). Here’s how you can enable exporting:

- **CSV Export**: You can programmatically generate a CSV string from the data and trigger a download. For example, if you have an array of profile objects like:
  ```js
  let profiles = [
    { name: "John Doe", headline: "Engineer at TechCorp", location: "SF, CA" },
    ...
  ];
  ```
  you can build a CSV:
  ```js
  let csvContent = "Name,Headline,Location\n";
  profiles.forEach((p) => {
    csvContent += `"${p.name}","${p.headline}","${p.location}"\n`;
  });
  ```
  Then, you can use the **Downloads API** to save it as a file. Create a Blob from the string and use `chrome.downloads.download`:
  ```js
  const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: "text/csv" });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  chrome.downloads.download({
    url: url,
    filename: "linkedin_profiles.csv",
  });
  ```
  This will invoke Chrome’s download manager to save the file (the user will see it downloading). Using the `chrome.downloads` API as shown requires adding `"downloads"` to your manifest permissions ([Extensions / Develop  |  Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop#:~:text=Manage%20downloads)). Alternatively, without using the API, you could create an off-screen link:
  ```js
  let a = document.createElement("a");
  a.href = url;
  a.download = "linkedin_profiles.csv";
  a.click();
  ```
  This can work without the downloads permission in some cases (as it uses the page context to initiate a download), but using the official API is cleaner.
- **JSON Export**: This can be even simpler – you can `JSON.stringify()` your data object or array and either download it similarly (with a `.json` file extension) or just display it to the user to copy. For example:

  ```js
  const dataStr = JSON.stringify(profileData, null, 2); // pretty-print with 2-space indent
  ```

  Then create a Blob and download as above, or open a new tab with that JSON string for easy copying. A new tab approach might be:

  ```js
  const url = "data:text/json;charset=utf-8," + encodeURIComponent(dataStr);
  window.open(url);
  ```

  which opens a new tab with the JSON content that the user could save (this doesn’t require special permission either, but the user would then manually save it).

- **User interface for export**: It’s a good idea to provide a button or option for the user to trigger the export (we’ll discuss UI in the next section). For instance, you can have a “Download CSV” button in the extension’s popup that triggers the above logic.

No matter which format, ensure you **format the data correctly** (escaping commas or quotes in CSV, etc.). For CSV, wrapping fields in quotes as shown helps if there are commas within the text (like in the headline or location). JSON avoids that issue by structure.

If you only scrape one profile at a time, you might not even need to store multiple – you could immediately offer the data for download when the user clicks “Extract”. However, if you plan to allow accumulating many profiles and then exporting all together, manage an array in storage and perhaps give an option “Export All collected profiles”.

Lastly, inform the user where the file will go (Chrome typically saves downloads to the default download folder). The extension could also display a brief message like “Profile data saved as CSV!” once done, to confirm the action.

## Enhancing the Plugin

### Adding UI Elements for User Interaction

Thus far, our extension could technically work with just a content script that auto-runs on LinkedIn and perhaps uses `console.log` or auto-downloads a file. However, that’s not user-friendly. We can create a simple **browser action popup** to control the extension. This involves a few steps:

1. **Add a Popup HTML**: Create a `popup.html` file that will serve as the UI when the extension icon is clicked in Chrome’s toolbar. This HTML can be very simple – for example, a popup with a title, maybe some instructions, and a button like “Extract Profile Data” or “Export to CSV”.
2. **Link it in the Manifest**: In the `manifest.json`, add an `"action"` (for Manifest V3) section pointing to your popup. For example:
   ```json
   "action": {
     "default_popup": "popup.html",
     "default_icon": "icon.png"
   }
   ```
   This tells Chrome to show `popup.html` when the extension’s icon is clicked ([Hello World extension  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#:~:text=%7B%20,)). The icon image is optional (Chrome will use a default puzzle piece if not provided).
3. **Popup Script**: You can include a `<script src="popup.js"></script>` in your popup HTML. In `popup.js`, you’ll write JavaScript to handle UI events (like button clicks in the popup). For instance, when the user clicks “Extract”, the popup script can send a message to the content script or directly perform actions if it has the right context.

([How to install the unpacked extension in Chrome - Webkul Blog](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/)) _Chrome’s Extensions page with Developer Mode enabled._ The screenshot above shows the Chrome extensions management page. We have a puzzle icon in the toolbar for extensions; clicking an extension’s icon will open its popup (if defined). By enabling **Developer mode** (top right toggle), we can load our unpacked extension for testing. Once loaded, our extension’s icon will appear (you can pin it via the puzzle menu). When developing the popup, you can reload the extension to see changes reflected in real-time.

In our LinkedIn scraper scenario, a good workflow is: the user visits a LinkedIn profile page, then clicks the extension’s toolbar icon. The popup appears with perhaps the profile name (we can even have the content script send the name to the popup for confirmation) and options like “Save as JSON” or “Save as CSV”. The user clicks a button, and we trigger the data collection (if not already done) and then the file download.

**Connecting popup and content script:** There are two ways to get the data upon button click:

- _Content script already ran:_ If our content script auto-runs on page load, it might have the data ready or can quickly gather it. The popup can simply request that data. We can use `chrome.tabs.query` to find the active LinkedIn tab and then `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` to send a request (like `{action: "getProfileData"}`) to the content script. The content script, upon receiving this message, can respond with the data object. This uses Chrome’s messaging system.
- _Inject on demand:_ Alternatively, we could not inject the content script automatically, and only inject it when the user clicks “Extract”. Using the `"activeTab"` permission and `chrome.scripting.executeScript` (in MV3), the popup script can programmatically run the content script on the current tab. For example,
  ```js
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: { tabId: currentTabId },
    files: ["contentScript.js"],
  });
  ```
  and then perhaps use messaging to get results. This approach is a bit more advanced and typically you’d still need to somehow get the data out of that script.

For simplicity, many choose the first approach: auto-run content script, store the data (maybe in `chrome.storage` or a global variable), and then popup just triggers an export. This way, the heavy lifting (scraping) is done in the content script as soon as the page loads or when the user opens the popup.

On the UI itself, you can also display information. For example, after successful extraction, show “Profile data ready!” or list some of the extracted fields in the popup UI. This gives feedback to the user. You could also include a checkbox or two in the popup for user preferences, like “Include Experience details” or “Include Education details”, which your content script can take into account (through conditional logic based on these settings).

### Options to Select Which Data to Extract

Not every user will need all information, so adding some configurability can make your extension more versatile. Here are ways to implement that:

- **Popup Checkboxes or Form**: In the popup.html, include form controls (checkboxes, toggles) for various data categories. For instance: one checkbox for “Experience”, one for “Education”, one for “About”. If checked, the extension will gather that info; if unchecked, maybe it skips it. You can store these preferences using `chrome.storage` or simply read their states when the user clicks the action button.
  - For example,
    ```html
    <label
      ><input type="checkbox" id="includeExp" checked /> Include
      Experience</label
    >
    ```
    in popup.html, and in popup.js:
    ```js
    let includeExp = document.getElementById("includeExp").checked;
    chrome.tabs.sendMessage(
      tabId,
      {
        action: "scrapeProfile",
        includeExp: includeExp,
        includeEdu: includeEdu,
      },
      handleResponse
    );
    ```
    The content script then checks `request.includeExp` and if false, maybe doesn’t compile the experience data.
- **Extension Options Page**: Chrome allows an options page for persistent settings (defined via `"options_page"` in manifest). This is useful for settings that apply generally rather than per session. For a simple scraper, using the popup is sufficient, but if you had more complex configuration (like API keys, or default file format), an options page might be appropriate.
- **Selective Extraction via Context Menu**: This is another enhancement idea. You could add a context menu item (with the `"contextMenus"` permission and API) so that when the user right-clicks on a LinkedIn profile page, they can select something like “Scrape this profile’s experience only”. That would be handled by your extension and could trigger different behavior. However, this is an advanced feature and not necessary for a basic implementation.

In summary, enhancing the UI/UX is about giving control to the user. For our extension, even a single button that triggers “scrape and download” is an improvement over requiring the user to open dev tools. As you grow the extension, you can add more polish: show a loading spinner while data is being gathered, display a success message or badge text on the icon indicating data is ready, etc. Start simple and iterate.

## Testing and Debugging

### Debugging Tools and Common Issues

During development, you’ll want to test the extension frequently to ensure everything works smoothly. Here’s how to do it and what potential pitfalls to watch for:

- **Loading the Unpacked Extension**: In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/` and enable Developer Mode. Then click “Load unpacked” and select your extension’s folder. This will load your extension into Chrome for testing (you’ll see it appear in the list). You can keep the Extensions page open – it has an “Update” button to reload extensions after you make changes to the code. ([Hello World extension  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#:~:text=1,chrome%3A%2F%2Fextensions))Once loaded, navigate to a LinkedIn profile and try out the functionality. If you have a popup, click the extension icon to open it. Developer Mode also allows you to see any errors: if the manifest is misconfigured, Chrome will show an error on this page.

- **Using Chrome DevTools**: The content script runs in the context of the LinkedIn page, so to debug it, open DevTools on a LinkedIn profile (right-click -> Inspect). In the DevTools Console, you can see `console.log` outputs from your content script (they’ll show up as if the page logged them, but you can often identify them by file name/origin). You can also go to the **Sources** tab, find your content script (it will usually be listed under the page’s scripts, often in a section like `Extensions > your-extension-id > contentScript.js`), and set breakpoints or step through code. If something isn’t working, add `console.log` statements in the content script to trace the execution and variables.

- **Inspecting the Popup**: Chrome also allows you to inspect the extension popup. With the popup open, right-click inside it and choose Inspect. This opens DevTools for the popup.html, where you can debug the popup’s script just like a normal web page. This is useful to ensure button clicks are registering, and to see any errors in the popup script.

- **Background/Service Worker Debugging**: If you have a background script or (in Manifest V3) a service worker, you can inspect that as well. On the Extensions page (`chrome://extensions`), find your extension and click the "Service worker" link (in Manifest V3) to see its console. Or in Manifest V2, there would be an “Inspect views: background.html” link. This is only necessary if you implement background logic (like the webNavigation listener approach or similar messaging logic).

- **Common issues**:
  - _Manifest errors_: If your extension isn’t loading, check the Extensions page for manifest error messages. A common mistake is a JSON formatting error in manifest.json (missing comma, etc.) or a wrong field name.
  - _Content script not running_: If you don’t see any logs from your content script or it’s clearly not doing anything, ensure your `"matches"` pattern is correct. For example, if you put `"https://www.linkedin.com/in/*"` as the match, it will only run on profile URLs specifically under `/in/`. If a profile is shown under another path or if you visit other LinkedIn pages, it won’t run. Using a broader `"https://www.linkedin.com/*"` match (as we did in the example) covers all LinkedIn pages, but you might then need to gate your logic. Also note, as discussed, if you navigate via SPA without reloading, the content script might not re-inject. Testing by refreshing the page or directly opening a profile URL in a new tab can confirm the script works on a fresh load.
  - _Selectors failing_: You might log the `name` variable and find it’s empty. This likely means the selector didn’t find the element. Use DevTools to verify the element’s HTML and adjust your selector. For example, LinkedIn might change a class name from `text-body-medium` to something like `text-body-medium break-words ml0` (adding an extra class). If our selector was too strict or slightly off, it fails. You can try more general selectors (e.g., `document.querySelector('h1')` for name is very safe because the profile name is the only `<h1>`). For company names in experience, instead of relying on a class that might change, you might use relationship (like the first `<p>` tag after the job title could be the company).
  - _Timing issues_: Maybe the content script runs before LinkedIn has loaded the profile data (though usually the script will run after the DOM is mostly constructed). If you find that elements are not yet present, you may need to wrap your extraction code in a `window.onload` or use a `MutationObserver` to wait for the DOM node to appear. Alternatively, a simple `setTimeout` of a second before scraping could give the page time to finish rendering (not ideal, but a quick fix if needed).
  - _Multiple runs_: If your script is set to run on every LinkedIn page, be careful it doesn’t try to scrape when on non-profile pages (it might throw errors if it expects certain sections). We handled this by checking if certain elements exist. It’s a good idea to ensure your code only runs fully when `document.querySelector('h1')` (name) exists, otherwise exit.

If something goes wrong, use the feedback: error messages in console, logs, etc., to pinpoint the issue. Chrome will usually tell you if you tried to do something not allowed (e.g., if you try to use a permission you didn’t declare, it logs an error). Also test different scenarios: for example, test your extension on a profile with a very long “About” section, or a profile with no experience entries, to see if your code handles those gracefully (no experience might mean `document.querySelectorAll('#experience-section li')` returns 0 items, which is fine – just ensure it doesn’t break your logic).

**Updating Selectors when LinkedIn changes**: As noted earlier, LinkedIn might update their site. If users report the extension stopped working, the likely culprit is a changed DOM structure. To fix it, you’d go inspect a profile again, find the new element structure, and update your `querySelector` strings accordingly. If your code is well-organized, these might all be in one section of your script, which makes it easier to adjust ([GitHub - jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension: A chrome extension to scrape linkedin profiles](https://github.com/jorgeyza/linkedin-scraping-chrome-extension#:~:text=Note)).

### Ensuring Smooth Functionality

To ensure everything runs smoothly, run through a final checklist:

- Test on multiple LinkedIn profiles (maybe your own and a few connections or public profiles). This ensures consistency.
- Test the export functionality – does the downloaded file open correctly in Excel or a text editor? Are all fields captured?
- Verify that no data is left behind or stored unintentionally. For instance, if you store data in `chrome.storage`, maybe clear it or override it each time unless you intend to accumulate.
- Check performance: The script running on a profile should be near-instant. If you notice it’s slow or hangs, debug where it’s getting stuck (perhaps waiting too long on something). Usually, scraping a single page’s DOM is very fast.
- User experience: Is it clear to the user how to use the extension? Perhaps add a little note in the popup like “Navigate to a LinkedIn profile and click 'Extract' to download the data.” Instructions can go a long way for usability.
- **Compliance**: If you plan to publish, ensure your extension follows Chrome Web Store policies. For example, if you collect any personal data, you may need a privacy policy. Also ensure you’re not using forbidden code (like remote scripts).

Testing in **Developer Mode** is your friend during development ([ How to Publish Your Chrome Extension on the Chrome Web Store - DEV Community](https://dev.to/artem_turlenko/how-to-publish-your-chrome-extension-on-the-chrome-web-store-3p3e#:~:text=,all%20features%20work%20as%20expected)). Keep iterating until it works without errors. Once you’re happy, it’s time to package and perhaps publish your extension for others (or just yourself) to use.

## Packaging and Publishing

### Creating a Distributable Extension Package

When your extension is working as expected, you might want to **package** it. Packaging is basically turning your extension folder into a `.crx` file (Chrome extension file) or a zip file that can be distributed.

For personal use, you actually don’t need to formally package – you can keep loading it unpacked. But if you want to share it or back it up, packaging helps. Chrome provides a simple way to pack:

- Go to `chrome://extensions` and ensure Developer Mode is on.
- Click the **“Pack extension”** button. ([ How to Publish Your Chrome Extension on the Chrome Web Store - DEV Community](https://dev.to/artem_turlenko/how-to-publish-your-chrome-extension-on-the-chrome-web-store-3p3e#:~:text=1.%20Navigate%20to%20,file%20safe%20for%20future%20updates)) You will be prompted to select the extension’s folder and, if this is an update to a previously packed extension, an optional private key file. Since this is likely your first time, just select the extension folder and pack.
- Chrome will generate a `.crx` file (the extension package) and a `.pem` file (the private key). The `.crx` can be installed in Developer mode by others (by dragging it into the Extensions page), and the `.pem` is used to keep the same extension ID if you update the extension later. **Keep the .pem safe** if you plan to publish outside the Web Store or want to maintain the extension ID across versions ([ How to Publish Your Chrome Extension on the Chrome Web Store - DEV Community](https://dev.to/artem_turlenko/how-to-publish-your-chrome-extension-on-the-chrome-web-store-3p3e#:~:text=3,file%20safe%20for%20future%20updates)).

([How to install the unpacked extension in Chrome - Webkul Blog](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/)) _Extension loaded in Chrome and “Pack extension” option._ In the image above, the extension “BigCommerce Aliexpress Importer” is highlighted in the Extensions page, and you can see the **“Pack extension”** button at the top. In our case, after packing, we’d get a file like `linkedin-profile-scraper.crx`. However, note that modern Chrome may not allow direct installation of .crx files without some flags or via the Web Store for security reasons (except in Developer mode). So packing is mostly useful for publishing to the Chrome Web Store or for distribution in enterprise settings.

If your intention is to release the extension to others (publicly or privately), the recommended approach is to publish it via the **Chrome Web Store** rather than sharing .crx files. The Web Store handles installation and updates seamlessly for users.

### Publishing on the Chrome Web Store

Publishing your extension makes it available to install for anyone (or a limited audience if unlisted). Here are the steps to publish:

1. **Create a Developer Account**: Go to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard and sign in with a Google account. You will need to pay a one-time registration fee of $5 USD to activate your developer account ([ How to Publish Your Chrome Extension on the Chrome Web Store - DEV Community](https://dev.to/artem_turlenko/how-to-publish-your-chrome-extension-on-the-chrome-web-store-3p3e#:~:text=If%20you%20haven%E2%80%99t%20already%2C%20create,Web%20Store%20Developer%20Dashboard%20account)). This gives you the ability to publish extensions (and themes) on the Web Store.
2. **Prepare your Extension Package**: You will need to upload your extension as a ZIP file. This ZIP should contain your extension’s files (manifest, content script, etc.) with the manifest.json at the root of the ZIP. If you used “Pack” earlier, you might have a crx – but for Web Store, you upload a ZIP of the folder itself (crx is not used here). Create a ZIP of the extension folder (making sure to exclude any unnecessary files like .git or node_modules if you had those) ([ How to Publish Your Chrome Extension on the Chrome Web Store - DEV Community](https://dev.to/artem_turlenko/how-to-publish-your-chrome-extension-on-the-chrome-web-store-3p3e#:~:text=1,they%27re%20invisible%20by%20default)). Essentially, when someone installs your extension, they get exactly the contents of this ZIP.
3. **Add a New Item in Developer Dashboard**: In the Developer Dashboard, click “Add new item” ([ How to Publish Your Chrome Extension on the Chrome Web Store - DEV Community](https://dev.to/artem_turlenko/how-to-publish-your-chrome-extension-on-the-chrome-web-store-3p3e#:~:text=1,they%27re%20invisible%20by%20default)). You’ll be prompted to upload the ZIP file. Upload it, and the store will validate it. If your manifest or ZIP structure is invalid, it will error – otherwise, it will proceed, and you’ll see your item created (in an “Draft” state).
4. **Provide Extension Details**: Now you’ll need to fill out the listing information: the extension’s name (this comes from the manifest but you can adjust the display name), a detailed description, some category tags, and at least one screenshot image of your extension in action. You should prepare a couple of screenshots (1280x800 px or so, showing perhaps a LinkedIn profile and your extension popup or a result). Since our extension is about data extraction, you could show a screenshot of the downloaded CSV or the popup interface. Also, you’ll need a small icon (128x128px PNG) which the store will display. Fill in all required fields (the dashboard will highlight if something is missing) ([ How to Publish Your Chrome Extension on the Chrome Web Store - DEV Community](https://dev.to/artem_turlenko/how-to-publish-your-chrome-extension-on-the-chrome-web-store-3p3e#:~:text=3,user%20data%2C%20include%20a%20privacy)). If your extension handles user data, you’ll need to provide a privacy policy URL (for a simple scraper used personally, you might argue it doesn’t really handle data in a way that requires a policy, but to be safe, you can supply a link stating you don’t store or misuse data).
5. **Submit for Review**: Once everything is filled out, you can click “Publish” (or “Submit for review”). Google will then review your extension for compliance with their policies ([ How to Publish Your Chrome Extension on the Chrome Web Store - DEV Community](https://dev.to/artem_turlenko/how-to-publish-your-chrome-extension-on-the-chrome-web-store-3p3e#:~:text=,the%20permissions%20it%20actively%20uses)). This process can take a few days or sometimes longer. They check for things like malware, privacy issues, accurate description, and appropriate content. Given our extension is somewhat in a gray area (scraping a third-party site), it’s possible they might scrutinize it. Many data-scraping extensions do exist on the store, but ensure your description doesn’t sound like it’s for spamming or violating privacy. Emphasize how it works (it scrapes data the user can see, for personal use, etc.). If they have concerns, they might reject it and ask for modifications.
6. **Publishing and Updates**: Once approved, your extension becomes available on the Web Store at a unique URL. You can share that with others or search for it in the store. Users can install it with one click. For any update, you increment the version number in manifest and upload a new package in the dashboard. The update will go through a review and then roll out to users automatically.

A few additional tips for publishing:

- **Unlisted vs Public**: You have the choice to make the extension public (searchable by anyone) or unlisted (only accessible via direct link). If this extension is just for you or a specific group (and you’re wary of LinkedIn noticing it if it got too popular), unlisted might be the way to go.
- **Compliance**: As a reminder, published extensions need to follow Chrome Web Store policies. One relevant policy is not to scrape or use websites in a way that violates their terms of service. This is a bit of a gray area – some extensions that do similar things exist, but there’s a risk the Web Store could reject it if they interpret it as violating a third-party service’s policies. Many scrapers frame themselves as tools to export “your data” from LinkedIn (like your connections or profile info) which might be more palatable.
- **Description honesty**: Clearly state what the extension does in the description so users know. E.g. “This extension allows you to extract information from a LinkedIn profile you are viewing, including the name, headline, location, experiences, and education, and download it as a CSV file. **Note**: You must be logged in to LinkedIn and viewing a profile for it to work. This tool is for personal use on data you have access to.” Such a description sets the right expectation and also implicitly indicates you’re not hacking data you shouldn’t.

Once published, you can install the extension like any other user and it will update automatically when you push new versions. Monitor any user feedback or issues, and continue to improve the extension.

---

By following this comprehensive guide, you have built a Chrome extension from scratch that can scrape LinkedIn profile information in a controlled, ethical manner. You set up the extension’s manifest and structure, learned how to target LinkedIn’s DOM for key data, implemented data extraction with care for dynamic content and avoidance of detection, and provided ways to store and export the results. You also added a user interface to make the tool accessible and went through testing and publishing steps.

Developing an extension involves skills in web development, but as you’ve seen, the fundamentals are quite approachable. With this foundation, you can further customize the extension – for example, to scrape additional sections, integrate with other tools (maybe send the data to a Google Sheet via an API, etc.), or even adapt the principles to other websites. Always keep user experience and ethical use in mind. Happy coding, and enjoy the convenience of your new LinkedIn profile data extractor!

### **1. `manifest.json` (Chrome Extension Configuration)**

This file defines the extension settings, permissions, and which scripts to load.

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "LinkedIn Profile Scraper",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Extracts profile information from LinkedIn pages and exports it as CSV.",
  "permissions": ["storage", "downloads", "scripting", "activeTab"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://www.linkedin.com/*"],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": "icons/icon.png"
  },
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://www.linkedin.com/in/*"],
      "js": ["contentScript.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **2. `contentScript.js` (Extracting Data from LinkedIn)**

This script runs inside LinkedIn profile pages, extracts profile information, and stores it for later retrieval.

```js
// contentScript.js

function extractProfileData() {
  let profileData = {
    name: "",
    headline: "",
    location: "",
    experience: [],
  };

  // Extract Name
  const nameElement = document.querySelector("h1");
  profileData.name = nameElement ? nameElement.innerText.trim() : "Unknown";

  // Extract Headline
  const headlineElement = document.querySelector(
    "div.text-body-medium.break-words"
  );
  profileData.headline = headlineElement
    ? headlineElement.innerText.trim()
    : "Unknown";

  // Extract Location
  const locationElement = document.querySelector(
    "span.text-body-small.t-black--light.break-words"
  );
  profileData.location = locationElement
    ? locationElement.innerText.trim()
    : "Unknown";

  // Extract Experience
  const experienceItems = document.querySelectorAll(
    "#experience-section ul > li"
  );
  experienceItems.forEach((item) => {
    let jobTitle = item.querySelector("h3")?.innerText.trim() || "Unknown";
    let company =
      item.querySelector("p.pv-entity__secondary-title")?.innerText.trim() ||
      "Unknown";
    let dateRange =
      item
        .querySelector("h4.pv-entity__date-range span:nth-child(2)")
        ?.innerText.trim() || "Unknown";
    profileData.experience.push({ jobTitle, company, dateRange });
  });

  // Store extracted data in Chrome storage
  chrome.storage.local.set({ profileData });

  console.log("Profile Data Extracted:", profileData);
}

// Run the extraction when the page is loaded
extractProfileData();
```

---

### **3. `popup.html` (User Interface)**

This file defines the extension’s popup UI.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

        padding: 10px;
        width: 250px;
      }
      button {
        background-color: #0073b1;
        color: white;
        border: none;
        padding: 10px;

        cursor: pointer;
        font-size: 14px;
        margin-top: 10px;
      }
      button:hover {
        background-color: #005582;
      }
      p {
        font-size: 14px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3>LinkedIn Scraper</h3>
    <p>Click the button below to export the extracted profile data.</p>
    <button id="exportCSV">Export as CSV</button>
    <button id="exportJSON">Export as JSON</button>
    <script src="popup.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### **4. `popup.js` (UI Button Handlers and Data Exporting)**

Handles button clicks and retrieves stored data.

```js
// popup.js

// Function to download data as a CSV file
function downloadCSV(profileData) {
  let csvContent = "Name,Headline,Location\n";
  csvContent += `"${profileData.name}","${profileData.headline}","${profileData.location}"\n`;
  csvContent += "\nExperience:\n";
  csvContent += "Job Title,Company,Date Range\n";

  profileData.experience.forEach((exp) => {
    csvContent += `"${exp.jobTitle}","${exp.company}","${exp.dateRange}"\n`;
  });

  const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: "text/csv" });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  chrome.downloads.download({
    url: url,
    filename: "linkedin_profile.csv",
  });
}

// Function to download data as a JSON file

### **5. `background.js` (Optional - Handles Service Worker Tasks)**

This script can help detect LinkedIn profile navigation and auto-run extraction.

```js
// background.js

chrome.webNavigation.onCompleted.addListener(
  (details) => {
    if (details.url.includes("linkedin.com/in/")) {
      chrome.scripting.executeScript({
        target: { tabId: details.tabId },
        files: ["contentScript.js"],
      });
    }
  },
  { url: [{ hostContains: "linkedin.com" }] }
);
```

### **6. `icons/icon.png` (Optional)**

Add an `icons/` folder and place an icon (128x128 pixels) inside. Modify `manifest.json` to point to the icon.
