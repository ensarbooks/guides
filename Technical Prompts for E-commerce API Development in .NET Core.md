# Technical Prompts for E-commerce API Development in .NET Core

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Configure JWT Authentication**: Set up JWT Bearer authentication in the API. For example, register JWT bearer in the services (e.g. `AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme).AddJwtBearer(...)`) with token validation parameters like issuer, audience, signing key, etc ([JWT Authentication In ASP.NET Core](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/jwt-json-web-token-authentication-in-asp-net-core/#:~:text=public%C2%A0void%C2%A0ConfigureServices%28IServiceCollection%C2%A0services%29%20%7B%20services.AddAuthentication%28JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme%29%20.AddJwtBearer%28options%C2%A0%3D)). Ensure the `app.UseAuthentication()` and `app.UseAuthorization()` middleware are in the pipeline so that `[Authorize]` attributes on controllers are enforced.
- **JWT Token Issuance (Login)**: Implement a login endpoint that validates user credentials and issues a JWT token. Upon successful login, create a JWT containing user ID and roles/claims, set an appropriate expiration, and sign it with a secret key. Return this token to the client for inclusion in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on subsequent requests.
- **Protect Endpoints with [Authorize]**: Apply the `[Authorize]` attribute on secured API controllers or actions to require a valid JWT. Use roles or policy parameters as needed, for example `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` to restrict access to admin users ([Role-based authorization in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles?view=aspnetcore-9.0#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20the%20following%20code,role)). This ensures that unauthorized requests are blocked with 401/403 responses by the framework.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Define user roles (e.g., Customer, Admin) and assign them upon user creation or through an admin interface. Use role-based authorization in controllers (as above) or define policies for more complex rules. For instance, register an authorization policy that requires a specific role or claim and use `[Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdministratorRole")]` for certain admin-only operations ([Role-based authorization in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles?view=aspnetcore-9.0#:~:text=builder.Services.AddAuthorization%28options%20%3D%3E%20%7B%20options.AddPolicy%28,)) ([Role-based authorization in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles?view=aspnetcore-9.0#:~:text=%5BAuthorize%28Policy%20%3D%20,return%20View%28%29%3B)).
- **Implement Refresh Tokens**: For better security, issue short-lived JWT access tokens and implement a refresh token mechanism. Store refresh tokens (securely, e.g., hashed in a database) when the user logs in, and provide an endpoint for clients to exchange an expired JWT and a valid refresh token for a new JWT. This helps to keep users logged in without long-lived JWTs, and allows token revocation if needed by invalidating the refresh token.
- **OAuth2 Social Login**: Integrate external authentication providers (like Google, Facebook, or Azure AD) if users can log in via social accounts. Use OAuth2/OpenID Connect by registering the external auth scheme (e.g., `AddAuthentication().AddGoogle(...)` with client ID/secret). Handle the external provider's callback in your app to create or match local user accounts and then issue your JWT or cookie.
- **Use ASP.NET Core Identity (Optional)**: Consider using ASP.NET Core Identity for user management, which can handle password hashing, user storage, and external logins out-of-the-box. Identity can be configured to produce JWTs if using IdentityServer4 or similar, or it can be used with cookie authentication for a web app. Ensure password rules and hashing algorithms are strong (Identity uses secure hashing like PBKDF2 by default).
- **Claims-Based Policies**: If roles are not granular enough, use claims-based authorization. Issue JWTs with custom claims (e.g., `"Subscription":"Premium"`). Define policies in `AddAuthorization` that require certain claims (`options.AddPolicy("PremiumUser", policy => policy.RequireClaim("Subscription","Premium"));`) and decorate endpoints with `[Authorize(Policy = "PremiumUser")]`. This allows flexible access control beyond static roles.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: For highly sensitive operations (like managing payment methods), consider enforcing 2FA for users. This could involve using an SMS/email code or an authenticator app code. In practice, this might be implemented by requiring a verified code before allowing certain actions or by issuing a stronger JWT only after 2FA. (This prompt is more relevant if you have an interactive login; with pure API, you'd handle 2FA as part of the auth flow.)
- **Logout/Token Revocation**: Provide a way to invalidate JWTs if needed (although JWTs are stateless, you can maintain a denylist). For example, implement a "logout" endpoint for JWT by server-tracking token identifiers or using short token lifetimes so that logout is essentially handled client-side by discarding the token. Invalidate refresh tokens on logout so they cannot be used to get new JWTs.

## Product Management

- **Product Entity & DB Setup**: Define a `Product` model with properties like `Id`, `Name`, `Description`, `Price`, `Stock`, etc. Set up an `ApplicationDbContext` with a `DbSet<Product>` and apply Entity Framework Core migrations to create the products table. Ensure the database connection string and provider (e.g., SQL Server, SQLite) are configured.
- **Get All Products Endpoint**: Implement a GET endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/products`) to retrieve the list of products. In the controller action, query the database context for all products asynchronously and return them. For example: `return Ok(await dbContext.Products.ToListAsync());` to return a 200 OK with the product list ([ASP.NET Core 6 Web API CRUD With Entity Framework](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/asp-net-core-6-web-api-crud-with-entity-framework/#:~:text=%5BHttpGet%5D%20public%20async%20Task%20,ToListAsync%28%29%29%3B)). Include related data like category via `.Include(...)` if needed for the response.
- **Get Product by ID**: Implement `GET /api/products/{id}` to fetch a single product by its ID. Use `FindAsync` or `FirstOrDefaultAsync` on the context and check for null to return 404 NotFound if the product doesn’t exist ([ASP.NET Core 6 Web API CRUD With Entity Framework](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/asp-net-core-6-web-api-crud-with-entity-framework/#:~:text=%5BHttpGet%5D%20%5BRoute%28,return%20Ok%28contact%29%3B)). This ensures clients get a proper HTTP status if they request a non-existent product.
- **Create Product (POST)**: Implement a POST endpoint to add a new product. The action should accept a DTO (e.g., `ProductCreateDto`) with required fields. Validate the input (via `[Required]` attributes or manual checks). Map the DTO to a `Product` entity and save it to the database with `SaveChangesAsync`. Return a 201 Created with the new product data. For example, create a new `Product`, set its properties, and call `dbContext.Products.AddAsync(product)` and `dbContext.SaveChangesAsync()` ([ASP.NET Core 6 Web API CRUD With Entity Framework](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/asp-net-core-6-web-api-crud-with-entity-framework/#:~:text=%5BHttpPost%5D%20public%20async%20Task%20,Phone)). Possibly return a Location header pointing to the new resource.
- **Update Product (PUT)**: Implement `PUT /api/products/{id}` to update an existing product. Fetch the product by ID, return 404 if not found. Apply changes from the incoming DTO (e.g., update name, price, etc.), then save changes. Consider using EF Core’s change tracking (fetch the entity, update fields, then `SaveChangesAsync`). Alternatively, use `PATCH` for partial updates if needed (with JSON Patch or manual). Concurrency should be handled – e.g., use rowversion or concurrency tokens to avoid overwriting newer data.
- **Delete Product**: Implement `DELETE /api/products/{id}` to remove a product. Find the product, if not found return NotFound. If found, remove it via `dbContext.Products.Remove(product)` and save changes. Return an appropriate status (200 OK with the deleted resource, or 204 No Content). Also, consider cascade deletes or restrictions if the product is referenced by orders (you might prevent deletion if it’s in an order, or use soft deletes).
- **Product Categories**: Introduce a `Category` entity and link it to products (one-to-many). Each `Product` can have a `CategoryId` and a navigation property. Create CRUD endpoints for categories as well (e.g., `GET /api/categories` and `GET /api/categories/{id}` with products). When returning products, include category info (either by eager loading with `.Include(p => p.Category)` or by mapping to a DTO that contains category name). Provide a way to filter products by category (e.g., `GET /api/products?categoryId=5`).
- **Product Attributes/Variants**: If needed, design a schema for product variants or attributes (e.g., size, color for a clothing product). This could be a separate table linked to Product (one-to-many, Product -> ProductVariant). Implement endpoints to manage variants or include them in product detail responses. Ensure that inventory is tracked per variant if applicable (e.g., stock per size/color).
- **Inventory Tracking**: Maintain a stock quantity for each product (or variant). Every time an order is placed, decrement the stock accordingly. This requires that the order placement logic checks stock availability (don’t allow ordering more than in stock) and, upon successful order, updates the stock atomically. Consider using database transactions during order creation to avoid race conditions where two orders might sell the last item simultaneously. If using EF, you might use a transaction or the `[ConcurrencyCheck]` attribute on the stock field.
- **Bulk Operations**: Provide endpoints for bulk operations if relevant (for example, bulk upload of products via CSV, or batch price update). These endpoints should handle large input gracefully, perhaps by processing asynchronously or in chunks. Also, enforce proper security (only admins can use them) and validate data thoroughly.
- **Search and Sorting**: Implement query capabilities on the product list endpoint. For example, allow clients to search products by name or description (`GET /api/products?search=phone`) and to sort results (`?sort=price_asc` or `price_desc`). This can be done by applying LINQ filters on the EF Core query. Be mindful of performance and consider adding indexes on searchable fields (like product name).

## Order Processing

- **Shopping Cart Model**: Decide how to manage the shopping cart. In a web API scenario, the cart can be maintained client-side (e.g., a web or mobile app holds the cart state and sends it on checkout) or server-side (e.g., a temporary cart in the database or in-memory cache per user). A simple approach is to have the client send the cart details to a checkout endpoint. Alternatively, create a `Cart` entity and `CartItem` entity to persist cart contents (keyed by a user ID or session ID) so the server can store carts between sessions.
- **Add to Cart Endpoint**: If maintaining cart server-side, implement `POST /api/cart/items` to add an item to the current user's cart. The request would include product ID and quantity. The API should verify product exists and possibly that enough stock is available. Save or update the cart item in the data store (increase quantity if item already in cart). Return the updated cart or item info. If cart is in-memory only, this might instead be handled client-side and this endpoint may not be necessary.
- **View Cart Endpoint**: Implement `GET /api/cart` to retrieve the current user's cart with all items, including product details (name, price) and a calculated subtotal. If the cart is tied to a user account, use the user's identity (from JWT) to fetch their cart. If it's session-based and the session ID is provided in a cookie or token, use that to identify the cart. This allows the front-end to display the cart contents before checkout.
- **Checkout Endpoint**: Implement a `POST /api/orders/checkout` (or `/api/orders`) endpoint that processes an order. The request would contain the cart items (if not stored on server) along with customer info needed (shipping address, etc.). On the server, validate stock for each item, calculate the total price, and create an `Order` record with status (e.g., "PendingPayment" or "Processing"). Save related `OrderItem` records for each product in the order with its quantity and price at time of order. Wrap this in a transaction so that all order items and stock updates succeed or fail together.
- **Order Entity Design**: Create an `Order` entity (with fields like OrderId, UserId, OrderDate, TotalAmount, Status, etc.) and an `OrderItem` entity (OrderItemId, OrderId, ProductId, Quantity, UnitPrice, etc.). Establish relationships in EF Core (Order has many OrderItems). When an order is placed, you will add an Order and multiple OrderItems to the DB. Optionally, include fields for shipping address, payment transaction ID, and tracking number on the Order.
- **Inventory Deduction**: During checkout, once payment is confirmed (or if COD, at order placement), decrement product stock levels. This can be done by subtracting the quantity in each OrderItem from the associated Product’s stock and saving. Ensure this happens within the same transaction as order creation to avoid inconsistency (so if stock update fails, order is not saved). Alternatively, use database constraints or stored procedures for this atomic update.
- **Order Confirmation**: After successfully creating the order (and possibly processing payment), return a confirmation response. This could include the new Order ID and status. If synchronous payment was part of the request, indicate payment success. If payment is asynchronous (like via an external redirect), create the order in a pending state and update it later (the endpoint can return the order pending payment).
- **Order Status Updates**: Implement an endpoint or mechanism for updating order status. For example, an admin or automated process might mark an order as "Shipped". `PUT /api/orders/{id}/status` with a status value can update the Order.Status (with appropriate authorization). When an order ships, record the shipping carrier and tracking number in the order. The system might also automatically set status to "Completed" when delivered or "Cancelled" if a refund occurs.
- **Order History Endpoint**: Provide `GET /api/orders` (with auth) to list orders for the authenticated user. This should return summary info (order IDs, dates, total, status) and perhaps allow filtering by status or date. For admin users, you might allow querying all orders or by user. Ensure regular users can only fetch their own orders (enforce via user ID check or global filter).
- **Order Details Endpoint**: Implement `GET /api/orders/{id}` to retrieve detailed information about a specific order. This should include the order data and its items (product names, quantities, prices). Ensure authorization: only the owner of the order or an admin can view it. This is useful for showing order confirmation or history details on the client side.
- **Shipping Integration**: If the app requires generating shipping labels or tracking, integrate with a shipping API (like UPS/FedEx API) after an order is marked as ready to ship. This could be done in an admin interface outside the API, but the API can store tracking numbers. Provide an endpoint for clients to retrieve tracking info: e.g., `GET /api/orders/{id}/tracking` which returns the carrier and tracking URL/number if available.
- **Email Notifications**: (Optional but common) After an order is placed, trigger an email confirmation to the user with order summary. You can integrate an email service (SMTP, SendGrid, etc.) in the order processing flow. This might be done asynchronously (e.g., place a message on a queue to have a background service send the email) so the checkout response isn’t delayed. Similarly, email notifications on status changes (shipped, delivered) improve user experience.
- **Cancellation & Refunds**: Implement order cancellation logic. For instance, if an order is in "Pending" or "Processing" and not yet shipped, allow the user or admin to cancel it via `DELETE /api/orders/{id}` or a custom action. This would set status to "Cancelled", possibly initiate a refund via the payment gateway, and return items to stock. Ensure that once an order is shipped, cancellation is either disallowed or triggers a returns process.
- **Testing the Order Workflow**: Simulate an entire order placement in a test environment to verify all steps. For example, ensure that when a product’s stock is 5 and two orders of 3 are placed concurrently, one order might succeed and the other should fail or back-order if stock goes negative – this helps validate concurrency control. Use integration tests or careful manual testing for these scenarios.

## Payment Gateway Integration

- **Install Payment SDKs**: Add the NuGet packages for the payment providers you plan to support. For example, install `Stripe.net` for Stripe integration or the PayPal Checkout SDK for PayPal. Having these libraries will simplify calling the provider APIs. Configure any necessary client keys or secrets in your configuration (appsettings) for use in code.
- **Configure Payment Settings**: Store API keys and secrets securely. For Stripe, you might add a section in _appsettings.json_ for Stripe and load it into a config object. Set the Stripe API key at startup, e.g., `StripeConfiguration.ApiKey = Configuration["Stripe:SecretKey"];` so that the Stripe library is ready to use ([How To Integrate Stripe in ASP.NET Core? - WireFuture](https://wirefuture.com/post/how-to-integrate-stripe-in-asp-net-core#:~:text=builder.Services.Configure%3CStripeSettings%3E%28builder.Configuration.GetSection%28%20,StripePaymentService)). Similarly, for PayPal, configure the environment (sandbox or live) with your client ID/secret using their SDK (e.g., create a `PayPalEnvironment` with creds) ([Integrating PayPal Payment Gateway with .NET Core](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/integrating-paypal-payment-gateway-with-net-core/#:~:text=public%20static%20PayPalEnvironment%20Environment%28%29%20,)). Never hard-code secrets; use user-secrets or environment variables for local dev and secure app settings in production.
- **Abstract Payment Service**: Create an interface like `IPaymentService` with methods such as `ProcessPayment(Order order)` or `CreateCheckoutSession(order)`. Implement this interface for each provider (e.g., `StripePaymentService`, `PayPalPaymentService`). This layer encapsulates provider-specific logic. For Stripe, for instance, you might implement `CreateCheckoutSession` to call Stripe’s SDK to create a Checkout Session and return the session URL or ID ([How To Integrate Stripe in ASP.NET Core? - WireFuture](https://wirefuture.com/post/how-to-integrate-stripe-in-asp-net-core#:~:text=public%20Session%20CreateCheckoutSession,)). For PayPal, you might implement a method to create an order via the PayPal API and get an approval URL.
- **Stripe Checkout**: If using Stripe, you can choose between Stripe Elements (processing card details directly) or Stripe Checkout (hosted page). A common approach is to use Stripe Checkout for simplicity: in your API, create a Checkout Session with line items representing the order (product name, quantity, price) and specify success/cancel URLs. The Stripe.NET SDK allows you to create a session by supplying payment method types, line items, and URLs ([How To Integrate Stripe in ASP.NET Core? - WireFuture](https://wirefuture.com/post/how-to-integrate-stripe-in-asp-net-core#:~:text=public%20Session%20CreateCheckoutSession,)). Return the session ID or URL to the client so they can redirect the user to Stripe’s checkout page. After payment, Stripe will redirect back to the provided URL (typically front-end handles that and calls your API to verify payment).
- **PayPal Integration**: For PayPal, use the PayPal Checkout SDK. Typically, you'd create an order (payment) via their API and get a link to PayPal's approval page. Implement an endpoint like `POST /api/payments/create-paypal-order` that uses `PayPalHttpClient` to create an order with purchase units for the cart total. Return the approval URL. After the user approves and PayPal redirects back, implement another endpoint to capture the payment (or do it on front-end and notify back). This will confirm the transaction and you can then mark the order as paid.
- **Payment Webhooks**: Implement webhook endpoints to handle asynchronous payment notifications. For example, Stripe will send a webhook event when payment is successful (if using Stripe Checkout or PaymentIntents). Set up an endpoint like `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` that listens for events, verify the event’s signature (Stripe provides a signing secret), and on a successful payment event, update the corresponding Order in your system to "Paid". Similarly, PayPal can send IPN or webhooks for payment capture events. This ensures your system knows about payments even if the client doesn’t return to your site.
- **Handle Payment Status**: In your order processing, distinguish between orders that are awaiting payment vs paid. For instance, if using an external checkout (Stripe/PayPal), you might create the Order with status "PendingPayment". Only set it to "Processing" or "Confirmed" after the webhook or return call indicates the payment went through. If payment fails or is abandoned, have a way to cancel or expire the pending order after some time.
- **Secure Payment Data**: Never log or store sensitive payment details (card numbers, CVV). Use the payment provider’s tokens. For example, if accepting card details directly, use Stripe Elements or similar to get a token or PaymentMethod ID on the client, then send that to your API to charge – this way, raw card data never touches your server. Comply with PCI DSS by outsourcing as much as possible to the provider.
- **Multi-Currency and Localization**: If your e-commerce supports multiple currencies, ensure the payment API calls specify the correct currency code (USD, EUR, etc.) and that your prices are converted appropriately. Also, handle localization in payment pages (Stripe Checkout auto-localizes based on the user's location; for PayPal ensure the locale is correct if needed).
- **Test Payments**: Use sandbox modes for testing. Stripe provides test API keys that simulate charges (and specific test card numbers to produce certain outcomes). PayPal’s sandbox allows test buyer and seller accounts. Write integration tests for payment flows using these modes if possible, or at least conduct manual testing to ensure the end-to-end flow (order -> payment -> webhook -> order update) works reliably.

## Security Measures

- **Enforce HTTPS**: Configure the application to use HTTPS only. In `Program.cs`, ensure `app.UseHttpsRedirection()` is enabled. Also enable HSTS in production with `app.UseHsts()` for strict transport security ([Enforce HTTPS in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl?view=aspnetcore-9.0#:~:text=ASP,app%20isn%27t%20in%20development%20mode)). This will tell browsers to always use HTTPS and add security headers. Obtain an SSL certificate for your host if not using a platform that provides one. All API requests should be protected in transit to prevent eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **CSRF Protection (if needed)**: If your API is consumed by web browsers using cookies (e.g., if you implement cookie auth for admin portal), protect against cross-site request forgery. Use anti-forgery tokens for state-changing requests. In MVC, decorating controllers with `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` ensures that POST/PUT/DELETE requests contain a valid token ([Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF) attacks in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery?view=aspnetcore-9.0#:~:text=,%2F%2F)). For pure JWT-based APIs, CSRF is less of an issue (since cookies are not used for auth), but if you set any auth cookies or allow any form of cookie authentication, include anti-forgery tokens.
- **Secure Sensitive Data**: Do not expose sensitive user info via the API. For example, never return passwords (even hashed) or payment details. Use HTTPS (as above) so that even token exchanges and user data are encrypted in transit. At rest, encrypt sensitive fields if necessary – for example, if storing credit card tokens or personal data, consider using AES encryption via the Data Protection API or similar. ASP.NET Core's Data Protection can be used to protect data before saving ([Get started with the Data Protection APIs in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/using-data-protection?view=aspnetcore-9.0#:~:text=%2F%2F%20protect%20the%20payload%20string,Protect%20returned%3A%20%7BprotectedPayload)), which is particularly useful for things like encryption of cookies or other persisted tokens.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Rigorously validate all incoming data. Use model validation attributes (like `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, `[Range]`) on DTOs to automatically enforce rules. For more complex rules, write custom validators or manual checks in controllers. This prevents malformed or malicious data from causing issues (e.g., extremely large values, negative quantities, or script injection in text fields). Always prefer parameterized queries (EF Core uses them by default) to avoid SQL injection.
- **Avoid Sensitive Data in JWT**: JWT tokens should contain only necessary info (user id, role, maybe minimal claims). Do not put secret data in JWTs as they can be decoded on the client side (they are just base64 encoded, not hidden). Also keep the JWT size small (large tokens can impact performance). Use strong signing keys and rotate them if possible. For extra security, consider using reference tokens (store auth info server-side and issue an opaque token referencing it) if JWT content sensitivity is a concern.
- **CORS Configuration**: Set up CORS so that only trusted domains can call your API from a browser context. For example, if your frontend is at `https://myshop.com`, configure the policy: `builder.Services.AddCors(options => options.AddPolicy("MyPolicy", policy => policy.WithOrigins("https://myshop.com").AllowAnyHeader().AllowAnyMethod()));` and use `app.UseCors("MyPolicy")`. This will prevent malicious websites from making AJAX calls to your API with a user's credentials.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to mitigate brute force or DDoS on certain endpoints (like login or payment). You can use middleware or libraries (e.g., the AspNetCoreRateLimit nuget or cloud infrastructure features) to limit requests per IP or per user in a time window. This helps prevent abuse (like password guessing or flooding your order API).
- **Audit Logging**: For security-critical actions (login, password change, payment, etc.), record audit logs. This could be as simple as writing to a log file or database table when certain events occur (user X changed password at time Y, IP Z). These logs help in forensic analysis in case of a breach and can also be used to alert on suspicious behavior (e.g., many failed logins might trigger an alert).
- **Use Security Headers**: Even though it's an API, if any part of the app serves web pages (maybe Swagger UI or an admin portal), ensure headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc., are set appropriately. For pure API JSON responses, these matter less, but you should at least ensure no sensitive information is revealed in headers or error messages.
- **Regular Security Testing**: Perform penetration testing or use tools (like OWASP ZAP) against your API. Address common vulnerabilities: for example, ensure that user IDs in paths can’t be tampered with to access others’ data (implement authorization checks correctly), and that error messages don't disclose stack traces or config info. Keep libraries up to date to pull in security patches.

## Performance Optimization

- **In-Memory Caching**: Utilize in-memory caching for data that is expensive to fetch and does not change frequently (e.g., product catalog, popular products, lookup tables for categories). ASP.NET Core’s IMemoryCache can be used to store these. For instance, cache the result of a product query so subsequent requests can serve from cache instead of hitting the DB. In a controller, you might do: `if(!_cache.TryGetValue("ProductList", out List<Product> products)) { products = await db.GetProductsAsync(); _cache.Set("ProductList", products, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)); }` ([Implementing In-Memory Cache in ASP.NET Core Web API](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/implementing-in-memory-cache-in-asp-net-core-web-api/#:~:text=if%20%28_memoryCache.TryGetValue%28%24,Price%20%3D%2099.99M)) ([Implementing In-Memory Cache in ASP.NET Core Web API](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/implementing-in-memory-cache-in-asp-net-core-web-api/#:~:text=_memoryCache.Set%28%24)). Always invalidate or update the cache when underlying data changes (e.g., clear or update the product cache on product create/update/delete).
- **Distributed Caching**: If the API is running on multiple servers (web farm or microservices), use a distributed cache like Redis instead of (or in addition to) in-memory cache so that all instances share cached data ([Cache in-memory in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/memory?view=aspnetcore-9.0#:~:text=ASP,requests%20to%20the%20same%20server)). ASP.NET Core supports IDistributedCache with Redis or SQL Server backing. This prevents cache misses on one server that another server has already computed, and avoids inconsistent data if one server’s cache is stale. It’s especially helpful for session data or rate-limiting counters in a multi-server scenario.
- **Database Indexes**: Review your database indexes. Ensure that columns frequently used in queries or filters (such as Product CategoryId, Order UserId for user order lookups, etc.) have proper indexes. Indexes can greatly speed up read operations. In EF Core, you can use the `[Index]` attribute on entity properties or the `HasIndex()` Fluent API in your DbContext configuration to create indexes via migrations ([The Index attribute in Entity Framework Core](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/configuration/data-annotation-attributes/index-attribute#:~:text=Explain%20code%20,code%20Copied)). Be careful to not over-index (which can slow down writes) – focus on query hotspots identified through profiling.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Utilize async/await for all I/O operations (database calls, HTTP calls to payment gateways, etc.). This allows the server to handle more concurrent requests by not blocking threads on I/O. Ensure your controller actions are `async Task<IActionResult>` and use EF Core’s async methods like `ToListAsync()`, `SaveChangesAsync()`, etc. The entire call chain should be async. This way, your app can scale with high throughput and use threads efficiently rather than waiting on external resources.
- **Bulk Operations Efficiency**: When performing bulk inserts or updates (like a batch of new products or processing many order items), consider using EF Core’s batch capabilities or even raw SQL/bulk tools if needed. EF Core 7 supports `ExecuteUpdate`/`ExecuteDelete` which can batch operations in a single query. For inserting many rows, a bulk extension or SqlBulkCopy might be used to speed things up. This reduces the overhead of saving thousands of entities one by one.
- **Paging and Filtering**: Never fetch more data than needed in one go. If a table can grow large (products, orders), implement pagination on the API (e.g., `GET /api/products?page=2&pageSize=50`). This limits the data per request and reduces memory usage and response size. Use `.Skip().Take()` in LINQ for EF Core to retrieve only the needed slice. Also return metadata (total count or next page link) if needed for the client.
- **Profiling and Monitoring**: Use tools to profile the application. Enable Application Insights or use middleware like MiniProfiler to track the performance of each request, DB query timings, etc. Identify slow queries (maybe missing an index or pulling back too much data) and optimize them. Look at metrics like request per second, CPU usage, memory usage under load, and tune the code or SQL accordingly.
- **Connection Pooling and Efficiency**: Rely on built-in connection pooling (ADO.NET does this by default). Make sure you are not opening and closing connections excessively in a way that pool can't handle (EF Core manages this nicely under the hood). Also, reuse HttpClient instances for outbound calls (like to payment services) rather than creating a new HttpClient for each request, to avoid socket exhaustion.
- **Caching of Static/Config Data**: If your API uses reference data (like list of countries, tax rates, etc.), load these once (at startup or on first use) and cache them for the lifetime of the application (or a long duration). No need to hit the DB for these on every request if they rarely change. You could store them in memory or a static class that all controllers can access, or in a MemoryCache entry that never expires (with manual invalidation when needed).
- **Optimize Serialization**: The API by default uses JSON serialization. Ensure your JSON responses are optimized – for example, remove unnecessary properties from response DTOs to reduce payload size. You can also enable response compression in ASP.NET Core (Add ResponseCompression middleware) to gzip responses which can greatly reduce bandwidth usage for large JSON. If performance is critical and JSON serialization is a bottleneck, consider alternative format like MessagePack or protobuf (especially for internal microservice communication using gRPC).
- **Threading and CPU work**: Minimize heavy CPU-bound work on the request thread. For example, if generating a PDF or image, consider offloading that to a background job. If it must be in request, at least make sure it’s optimized or use Task.Run to do it on a thread pool (though that still uses server CPU). Ideally, long CPU tasks should not block the handling of other requests. Also, consider using parallelism carefully (e.g., parallel LINQ or multithreaded loops) if you need to utilize all CPU cores for a big task, but be mindful not to starve the request thread pool.

## API Documentation

- **Add Swagger (OpenAPI)**: Integrate Swagger for API documentation. Install Swashbuckle (if using .NET 6/7) by adding the `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` NuGet. In your startup config, register Swagger services: e.g., call `builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();` ([Get started with Swashbuckle and ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-swashbuckle?view=aspnetcore-8.0#:~:text=builder)). This will auto-generate an OpenAPI document from your controllers and models. It's crucial for complex APIs to help other developers (or even front-end team) understand available endpoints and their schemas.
- **Enable Swagger UI**: In the HTTP request pipeline, enable the Swagger middleware and the Swagger UI. Use `app.UseSwagger();` to expose the JSON at `/swagger/v1/swagger.json` and `app.UseSwaggerUI();` to serve the interactive UI page ([Get started with Swashbuckle and ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-swashbuckle?view=aspnetcore-8.0#:~:text=app.UseSwagger%28%29%3B%20app.UseSwaggerUI%28%29%3B%20)). Typically, you might do this only in development (by wrapping in an `if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())` check) or secure it in production, depending if you want it publicly accessible. Once enabled, you can open the Swagger UI in a browser to see and test your endpoints.
- **Document Endpoints and Models**: Enhance the auto-generated docs with additional information. Use XML comments in your code (enable XML documentation file in project settings) on controllers and models, and then in `AddSwaggerGen` call `options.IncludeXmlComments(xmlPath)` to include those in Swagger. This way, each endpoint can have a summary/explanation, and each model property can have descriptions which will appear in the docs. This is very useful for developers consuming the API to know what each field means.
- **Organize with Tags**: By default, Swagger will tag endpoints by controller name. You can customize or use `[ApiExplorerSettings(GroupName = "...")]` or `[SwaggerOperation(Tags = new[] {"tag"})]` attributes to group endpoints. For instance, tag all product-related endpoints with "Products" and order ones with "Orders" for clarity in the UI. This helps when the API grows large, as one can easily toggle sections in Swagger UI.
- **Versioning in Docs**: If you implement API versioning (via URL or headers), configure Swagger to support multiple versions. You might call `SwaggerDoc` for each version in AddSwaggerGen (e.g., "v1", "v2") and use endpoint conventions to separate them. Versioning ensures backward compatibility for clients; documenting each version clearly in Swagger (with separate JSON docs) will prevent confusion about which endpoints belong to which version.
- **Include Security Schemes**: Since the API uses JWT auth, configure Swagger to allow setting a Bearer token. In AddSwaggerGen, use `options.AddSecurityDefinition("Bearer", ...)` to define a JWT auth scheme (usually a simple header input). Also use `AddSecurityRequirement` so that Swagger UI knows which endpoints require auth. This will put an "Authorize" button in the UI allowing you to paste a JWT and thereby authorize try-outs of secured endpoints.
- **Example Requests/Responses**: Use Swagger or data annotation capabilities to provide example inputs and outputs. Swashbuckle allows `[SwaggerRequestExample]` or you can manually edit the OpenAPI if needed. At minimum, ensure your responses (especially for complex types like Order with items) are well defined by your models, so the schema in the docs is accurate. This reduces the guesswork for API consumers.
- **Testing via Swagger**: Encourage using the Swagger UI in development to manually test endpoints. Because it provides an interactive form for each endpoint (with fields for parameters and body), a developer can quickly verify that an endpoint works and see the response without writing a separate client. This is both a debugging aid and documentation feature.
- **Generate Client Code**: Use the OpenAPI specification to generate API clients in various languages if needed. Tools like NSwag or AutoRest can take the Swagger JSON and produce C# classes or TypeScript services for the frontend. Provide these to third parties if they integrate with your API, as it speeds up their development and ensures accuracy.
- **Keep Documentation Updated**: Make it part of your development process to update docs/comments when endpoints change. Outdated documentation can be very harmful. If possible, automate the deployment of the latest Swagger JSON (maybe at a URL or as a static site) so that anyone can see the current API spec. If using Swagger, this is as simple as accessing the `/swagger/v1/swagger.json` or the UI. For completeness, consider writing a README or developer guide that complements Swagger with higher-level info (like authentication steps, example flows such as "how to place an order" combining multiple calls).

## Logging and Monitoring

- **Structured Logging with Serilog**: Integrate Serilog to capture structured logs for the application. Install Serilog (and perhaps sinks like Serilog.Sinks.File or Seq if needed). In Program.cs, before building the app, configure Serilog as the logging provider. For example: `Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration().ReadFrom.Configuration(config).CreateLogger(); builder.Host.UseSerilog();`. Also add Serilog request logging: `app.UseSerilogRequestLogging();` to automatically log HTTP requests with useful info (status, timing) ([c# - How to add Serilog in Program.cs in .NET6? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76641381/how-to-add-serilog-in-program-cs-in-net6#:~:text=builder.Host.UseSerilog%28%28ctx%2C%20lc%29%20%3D,Configuration)). This provides insight into traffic and errors in a machine-readable format (JSON logs or similar).
- **Audit Trail**: Use logs to maintain an audit trail of important actions. For instance, log an Information or Warning level entry when an order is placed or a payment fails. Include contextual details (user id, order id, error message). With structured logging, you can have properties like `OrderId=123` in the log, making it easy to filter logs for a specific order through your log management system.
- **Exception Logging**: Implement global error handling to catch unhandled exceptions and log them. In ASP.NET Core, use `app.UseExceptionHandler` to handle exceptions in production and return a friendly error response. Inside the exception handler, log the exception details (stack trace, message, etc.) using the logging framework. This ensures you have a record of all errors that occur, which is invaluable for troubleshooting.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrate Application Insights or another APM (Application Performance Management) tool if running in Azure (or equivalent for other clouds). Application Insights can record request durations, dependency call durations (like SQL queries), and exceptions automatically. Just adding the Application Insights SDK and configuration will start capturing telemetry. You can create custom events or metrics too (e.g., log a custom metric for "orders placed"). This helps in identifying performance bottlenecks in production by looking at aggregated metrics and traces.
- **Health Checks**: Implement health check endpoints and monitoring. ASP.NET Core Health Checks allow you to easily expose the health of the application and its dependencies. Add `builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()` and map an endpoint, e.g., `app.MapHealthChecks("/health")` ([Health checks in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-9.0#:~:text=builder)) ([Health checks in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-9.0#:~:text=app.MapHealthChecks%28)). You can plug in checks for the database (e.g., AddSqlServerHealthCheck) and other services. Then, configure your orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker, or load balancer) to call this endpoint to verify the app's health. This way, if something like the DB connection fails, the health check can report unhealthy and trigger a restart or alert.
- **Real-time Monitoring Dashboards**: Use a combination of logging and metrics to set up dashboards. For example, in Application Insights or Grafana (with Prometheus if using), create charts for requests per minute, error rate, average latency, etc. Monitor these dashboards to spot anomalies (e.g., a spike in response time or errors might indicate an emerging issue). Logging frameworks like Serilog can also write to metrics systems or you can use EventCounters in .NET for certain things.
- **Alerts**: Set up alerts on critical conditions. For instance, if the error rate goes above a threshold, or if the health check endpoint fails, have the system send an alert (email, SMS, etc.) to the development/Ops team. This ensures that issues are addressed promptly. Azure Monitor or CloudWatch (AWS) etc., can be configured to trigger alerts based on logs or metrics.
- **Log Sensitive Data Carefully**: Ensure you **do not log** sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or personal user data. Audit your logging statements to avoid accidental leaks. For instance, logging entire request bodies for debugging can be dangerous if those bodies include passwords. Use logging scopes or filters to include useful context (like request ID, user ID) without dumping confidential info.
- **Use Correlation IDs**: Implement correlation IDs for tracing requests end-to-end, especially in distributed systems. ASP.NET Core by default has `RequestId` (trace identifier) which Serilog can include. You can also use a middleware to read an incoming header (like X-Correlation-ID) or generate one, and attach it to log scopes. This way, all logs for a given request (even across services) can be tied together by this ID. It makes debugging across multiple microservices or components much easier.
- **Periodic Log Reviews**: Make it a practice to review logs regularly, not just when there's an issue. You might discover warnings or subtle errors that haven't been noticed. Perhaps some background job is failing quietly or there are a lot of 404s indicating a client is calling a wrong URL. Continuous monitoring and log analysis can lead to proactive improvements (like fixing an endpoint that clients are struggling with, or tightening security if you see many failed auth attempts).

## Scalability and Load Balancing

- **Containerization**: Package the application in a Docker container to ensure it can run consistently across environments. Write a Dockerfile using the official .NET runtime images (e.g., `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0` for runtime, and build with `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0` if needed). Multi-stage build to copy the published app into the runtime image. Expose the port (e.g., 80) and use environment variables for configuration (like connection strings, API keys). This container can then be deployed to a container orchestrator or cloud service easily.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design the app to run on multiple instances behind a load balancer. Ensure statelessness: do not use in-memory sessions or caches that aren't shared (use distributed cache for any shared state). If using JWTs, they are stateless and work fine on multiple servers. Use a load balancer (cloud LB, Nginx, etc.) to distribute incoming requests to multiple API instances. Test that you can run, say, 3 instances of the API and still function correctly (especially with things like caching and user session).
- **Distributed Cache & Session**: If you decide to use session state for any reason (like shopping cart in session), configure a distributed cache (SQL, Redis) for session storage across the farm ([Cache in-memory in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/memory?view=aspnetcore-9.0#:~:text=ASP,requests%20to%20the%20same%20server)). This ensures that if successive requests from the same user hit different servers, they still share the same session data. Even for caching, as mentioned, use a distributed cache to share results across instances.
- **API Gateway**: In a microservice architecture, use an API Gateway to route requests to the correct service and to offload concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and aggregation. Tools like Ocelot (for .NET) or Azure API Management or AWS API Gateway can serve as a single entry point. This way, the client doesn’t need to know about multiple service URLs. The gateway can route `/api/orders` to the Order service, `/api/products` to the Product service, etc., and also handle JWT validation globally.
- **Microservices Decomposition**: Consider splitting the application into smaller services if the domain and load warrants it. For example, a Product Service, Order Service, Payment Service, etc., each with its own database. Communicate between services either synchronously (REST/gRPC) or asynchronously (using messaging). This can improve scalability and maintainability, as each service can scale independently (e.g., during a sale, maybe the Order service needs more instances). Be prepared to handle distributed transactions or eventual consistency if data spans services (e.g., an order service might need to inform product service to decrement stock via events).
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: If using Kubernetes, create Deployment and Service manifests for the API. The Deployment will manage the number of pods (instances) and can scale them (manually or via Horizontal Pod Autoscaler based on CPU/memory). The Service (of type LoadBalancer or ClusterIP with an ingress) will distribute traffic to pods. Use readiness probes (perhaps hitting `/healthz` endpoint) so K8s only sends traffic to healthy pods. Utilize auto-scaling: e.g., scale out when CPU > 70%. Also use rolling updates for zero downtime deployments.
- **Message Queues for Load Leveling**: Introduce a message broker (like RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Kafka) for tasks that can be processed asynchronously. For example, order placement could put a message "OrderCreated" on a queue that a warehouse service consumes to fulfill. This decouples the immediate HTTP response from heavier processing. It also adds resiliency – if the processing part fails, the message stays and can be retried. Use this pattern for sending confirmation emails, syncing data to other systems, etc., to keep the API response snappy.
- **Distributed Transactions**: In a distributed environment, you may not have traditional transactions spanning services. Use eventual consistency and compensating actions. For instance, if payment succeeds but order entry fails, have a recovery process (maybe a saga) that checks for orphaned payments. Tools like MassTransit with saga support or custom coordination logic might be used to ensure all parts of a multi-step process complete or are rolled back.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: For static content (product images, etc.), use a CDN to offload traffic from the core application. Even though the API might provide image URLs (perhaps from Azure Blob or S3), a CDN in front of those storage endpoints will cache and serve them faster globally. This reduces the load on your API/storage especially if images are frequently accessed.
- **Cloud Scaling Services**: If deploying to cloud platforms (Azure App Service, AWS Beanstalk/ECS/EKS), leverage their auto-scaling features. Configure rules such as: if average CPU > 80% for 5 minutes, add an instance; scale down when < 30%. Similarly, scale based on queue lengths (e.g., if using a queue, scale the consumers when backlog grows). Ensure your app can startup quickly and handle being started/stopped frequently (avoid long initialization, and handle graceful shutdown by listening for cancellation token in .NET, etc.).
- **Database Scaling**: Anticipate scaling at the data layer. For reads, you can use read replicas to offload read traffic (and configure your app or EF Core to direct read-only queries to replicas). Use caching as mentioned to reduce direct DB hits. If using Azure SQL or others, choose appropriate service tiers or use sharding/partitioning for very high scale. Monitor DB performance counters (DTUs or CPU, memory, I/O) and optimize queries or scale up the DB as needed.
- **High Concurrency Considerations**: Ensure code that might run concurrently is thread-safe. For example, if you have any singleton services or in-memory structures, consider locking or using concurrent collections. Avoid static mutable state if possible, as that becomes a bottleneck or risk when multiple requests hit it. Also, test your application with concurrent users (use load testing tools) to see if any race conditions or deadlocks occur. This will let you catch issues in how you manage resources under load.

## Unit and Integration Testing

- **Set up Unit Test Project**: Use xUnit (or NUnit/MSTest) for unit tests. Create a separate test project in the solution, and reference the API project or its relevant libraries. Ensure you can access internal classes if needed (you can use `[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("YourTestProject")]` in the API if you want to test internal methods). Write tests for the smallest units of logic – e.g., services, controllers (with dependencies mocked), utility classes, etc.
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Use a mocking framework like Moq to simulate database repositories, external services, or any dependency so that unit tests are isolated. For example, if testing the OrderService, mock the ProductRepository to return a certain stock count. In a controller test, you can mock the service that the controller calls. With Moq, you set up expectations like `mockRepo.Setup(r => r.GetById(1)).ReturnsAsync(product)` and inject `mockRepo.Object` into the service or controller. This way, your test focuses on business logic (e.g., that an order is marked OutOfStock if stock insufficient) without requiring a real DB. In the test, you might instantiate the controller with a Mock repository: `_mockRepo = new Mock<IProductRepository>(); _controller = new ProductsController(_mockRepo.Object);` ([Testing Controllers with Unit Tests and Moq in ASP.NET Core -](https://code-maze.com/unit-testing-controllers-aspnetcore-moq/#:~:text=private%20readonly%20Mock,readonly%20EmployeesController%20_controller)).
- **Test Controllers**: Verify that controllers return correct IActionResult and status codes. For example, test that `GET /products/{id}` returns 404 for a missing product: set up the repository mock to return null and assert that controller action returns `NotFoundResult`. Also test the happy path returns 200 and the correct data. Use xUnit's Assert to check result types and values (e.g., `Assert.IsType<OkObjectResult>(result)` and then `.Value`). For easier testing, consider not using [ApiController] conventions for unit tests (or configure the controller's ModelState manually) because [ApiController] auto-behavior (like automatic 400 on model validation failure) might not trigger in a simple unit test context.
- **Business Logic Testing**: Write tests for any complex business calculations or decisions. For instance, if you have a method to calculate discounts or to apply tax, feed it various inputs and assert the outputs. If order total calculation sums item prices and adds tax, test that logic with known values. These pure functions or service methods are ideal for unit testing because they have clear input-output.
- **Authentication/Authorization Testing**: At the unit level, you might not test the [Authorize] attributes (that's more of an integration concern with the framework). But you can test components like a custom authorization handler or any token generation logic. For example, if you have a method that creates JWTs, you could unit test that it produces a token containing expected claims. Similarly, if you wrote custom middleware for auth, unit test it by faking an HttpContext. However, much of auth can be assumed to work if using the framework correctly; focus on your extensions.
- **Integration Testing with TestServer**: Leverage `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` to create an in-memory test server for your API. This allows you to write tests that make actual HTTP calls to your endpoints without deploying the API. For example, create a test class with `IClassFixture<WebApplicationFactory<Program>>` so you get a factory. Then in a test, do `var client = _factory.CreateClient(); var response = await client.GetAsync("/api/products");` and assert on the HTTP response ([Integration tests in ASP.NET Core | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests?view=aspnetcore-9.0#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Arrange%20var%20client%20%3D,CreateClient)). The factory will startup your full API (with routing, filters, etc.) but typically you will configure it to use a test database (like an in-memory DB) to avoid affecting real data.
- **Using In-Memory or Test DB**: When doing integration tests that hit the database, use an isolated environment. One approach is using the EF Core InMemory provider for a fake database. Configure the application for testing to use InMemory DB by overriding the startup in the WebApplicationFactory (there’s mechanisms to configure services). Alternatively, use a test container or localdb and apply migrations for testing. The key is each test should run in a predictable state (consider seeding necessary data at start of test or using a fresh DB instance per test to avoid data leaking between tests).
- **Test Payment Flow with Mocks/Sandbox**: Hitting real payment gateways in tests is not feasible, so abstract the payment integration behind an interface (as suggested) and inject a fake implementation in tests. The fake can simulate success or failure scenarios. Then write integration tests for order checkout that use the fake payment service – e.g., have the fake mark payment as succeeded – and ensure the order status becomes Paid and order is created. This way, you test the integration logic without external calls. For actual payment provider SDK calls, rely on their sandbox environment for manual testing, but for automated tests, use fakes.
- **Endpoint Response Contract Testing**: Write tests to ensure your endpoints return the correct shape of data. For example, an integration test for GET product by id could deserialize the JSON response and assert that it has the expected fields and values. This can catch issues where a refactor might accidentally change JSON property names or omit data. You can use `System.Text.Json` or `Newtonsoft.Json` in the test to parse the response content.
- **Testing Error Cases**: Don’t just test the “happy path”. Write tests for edge cases and error scenarios: e.g., attempting to add a product with missing required fields (should return 400 BadRequest with validation errors), or trying to order more items than in stock (maybe your API returns 400 or a specific error code). If you have custom error handling, test that it yields the intended output. These tests help ensure your API fails gracefully and as expected.
- **Automate Tests in CI**: Integrate the test execution into your CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.). This way, every pull request or build will run the unit and integration tests. It prevents regressions – if someone breaks the order total calculation, a test fails and catches it before the code is merged or deployed. Aim for a good coverage, but focus on critical logic rather than trivial getters/setters to keep maintenance reasonable.
- **Load Testing**: In addition to unit/integration tests, perform load tests to validate scalability (this is usually outside of typical unit tests). Use tools like JMeter, Locust, or k6 to simulate multiple users hitting the API (especially the heavy endpoints like checkout). This isn't run on each build, but maybe before a release or in a staging environment to ensure no performance regressions. While not part of the automated test suite, it's an important testing aspect for a complex e-commerce API.
- **Continuous Integration & Delivery**: Ensure that after tests pass, you have a clear path to deploy. Automate database migrations in a staging environment and run integration tests against a staging deployment as well (smoke tests). This goes beyond coding prompts, but it's crucial: treat infrastructure as code (use Terraform/ARM for cloud infra), and use pipelines to deploy after tests, so that the path from development to production is smooth and reliable.
