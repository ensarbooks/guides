# **Advanced Integration Guide: React, TypeScript & Material UI with a MySQL API**

This comprehensive guide walks through integrating a MySQL-backed REST API into a React.js project using TypeScript and Material UI. It’s structured for advanced developers and covers everything from project setup to deployment. We will use modern tools and best practices for state management, API communication, form handling, authentication, theming, testing, deployment, and performance optimizations. Each section includes step-by-step instructions, code examples, and references to relevant resources.

## 1. **Project Setup**

A solid project foundation is crucial. We’ll create a new React project (using **Create React App** or **Vite** with TypeScript), install required dependencies, configure linting/formatting, and organize the project structure for scalability.

### **Installing Dependencies**

Start by bootstrapping a React TypeScript project. For example, using Vite:

```bash
# Using Vite to create a React + TS project
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-app
npm install
```

This sets up a basic React TypeScript app. Next, install essential dependencies:

- **React Router** for routing: `npm i react-router-dom` ([JWT Authentication in React with react-router - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sanjayttg/jwt-authentication-in-react-with-react-router-1d03#:~:text=Before%20we%20proceed%2C%20let%27s%20ensure,begin%20by%20installing%20these%20dependencies))
- **Material-UI (MUI)** core and icons: `npm i @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`
- **State management** tools: Redux Toolkit and React-Redux (`npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`), and/or React Query (`npm i @tanstack/react-query`)
- **Axios** for API calls: `npm i axios` ([JWT Authentication in React with react-router - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sanjayttg/jwt-authentication-in-react-with-react-router-1d03#:~:text=Before%20we%20proceed%2C%20let%27s%20ensure,begin%20by%20installing%20these%20dependencies))
- **Forms & Validation**: React Hook Form and Yup (`npm i react-hook-form yup @hookform/resolvers`) ([How I use React Hook Form with Yup and TypeScript - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dicky54putra/how-i-react-hook-form-with-yup-and-typescript-1hk7#:~:text=npm%20install%20react))
- **Testing** libraries: Jest (comes with CRA or use `npm i --save-dev jest @types/jest` for Vite), React Testing Library (`npm i --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom`) ([React Testing Library | Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/#:~:text=npm%20install%20)) ([React Testing Library | Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/#:~:text=You%20want%20to%20write%20maintainable,you%20and%20your%20team%20down)), Cypress (`npm i cypress --save-dev`)

After installing, ensure your **TypeScript** config (`tsconfig.json`) has strict mode enabled and is set up for React. Enabling strict type-checking (e.g. `"strict": true`) catches errors early and enforces best practices ([React with TypeScript: Best Practices — SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-with-typescript-best-practices/#:~:text=developer%20productivity%20by%20catching%20errors,consistency%2C%20especially%20in%20team%20environments)). With dependencies in place, we can set up linting.

### **ESLint and Prettier Configuration**

Configuring ESLint and Prettier will help maintain code quality and consistency. Install ESLint and Prettier along with relevant plugins:

```bash
npm i --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint-plugin-react
npm i --save-dev prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier
```

Initialize ESLint with a config file:

```bash
npx eslint --init
```

Choose a TypeScript + React setup when prompted (ESLint can extend recommended configs for React and TS). For example, a generated **.eslintrc.json** might include:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "plugin:prettier/recommended"
  ],
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint", "react"],
  "rules": {
    // custom rules if any
  }
}
```

Extending `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` and `plugin:react/recommended` applies best-practice linting for TS and React ([How to set up ESLint and Prettier in React TypeScript 5 project? 2023 - DEV Community](https://dev.to/quizzes4u/how-to-set-up-eslint-and-prettier-in-react-typescript-5-project-2023-hd6#:~:text=%7B%20,eslint%2Frecommended%22%2C%20%22plugin%3Areact%2Frecommended%22)). The `plugin:prettier/recommended` extension integrates Prettier with ESLint to disable conflicting rules and format code automatically ([How to set up ESLint and Prettier in React TypeScript 5 project? 2023 - DEV Community](https://dev.to/quizzes4u/how-to-set-up-eslint-and-prettier-in-react-typescript-5-project-2023-hd6#:~:text=7,conflicts%20between%20Eslint%20and%20Prettier)). Prettier ensures a consistent code style across the project. Create a **.prettierrc** (or add to package.json) to define formatting preferences (e.g., 2-space indentation, single quotes, semicolon usage, etc.). In VSCode, installing the ESLint and Prettier extensions will enable on-save linting and formatting.

After setup, run `npm run lint` (and `npm run format` if configured) to verify everything works. From now on, ESLint will catch issues (like unused variables or incorrect hook dependencies) and Prettier will auto-format code, which is especially useful in team environments ([React with TypeScript: Best Practices — SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-with-typescript-best-practices/#:~:text=developer%20productivity%20by%20catching%20errors,consistency%2C%20especially%20in%20team%20environments)).

### **Project Structure**

Organize your source code for clarity and scalability. A common structure might be:

```
my-app/
 └── src/
     ├── components/      # Reusable UI components
     ├── pages/           # Page-level components (views for routes)
     ├── services/        # API service modules (Axios calls)  ([React TypeScript Folder Structure To Follow | Stackademic](https://stackademic.com/blog/react-typescript-folder-structure-to-follow-ae614e786f8a#:~:text=api%20%26%20services%3A))
     ├── store/           # State management (Redux slices or context)
     ├── hooks/           # Custom hooks
     ├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions (interfaces, etc.)
     ├── utils/           # Utility functions
     ├── App.tsx
     └── main.tsx (or index.tsx)
```

**Components**: Small, focused pieces of UI, e.g. `Button`, `Navbar`, etc., often in their own folders with an index file for easy imports ([React TypeScript Folder Structure To Follow | Stackademic](https://stackademic.com/blog/react-typescript-folder-structure-to-follow-ae614e786f8a#:~:text=)) ([React TypeScript Folder Structure To Follow | Stackademic](https://stackademic.com/blog/react-typescript-folder-structure-to-follow-ae614e786f8a#:~:text=,access%20point%20for%20that%20component)).  
**Pages**: Container components mapped to routes (e.g. `HomePage.tsx`, `AdminDashboard.tsx`).  
**Services**: Modules encapsulating API calls (e.g. `userService.ts` with functions to fetch or update user data). Keeping API calls in a dedicated service file or folder makes it easy to see all API usage in one place ([JWT Authentication using Axios interceptors | Mihai Andrei](https://mihai-andrei.com/blog/jwt-authentication-using-axios-interceptors/#:~:text=,if%20he%20is%20logged%20in)) ([JWT Authentication using Axios interceptors | Mihai Andrei](https://mihai-andrei.com/blog/jwt-authentication-using-axios-interceptors/#:~:text=I%20like%20to%20keep%20all,calls%20used%20in%20the%20app)). We’ll set this up in the API integration section.  
**Store**: Redux Toolkit setup (slices and store configuration) or other state logic.  
**Hooks**: Reusable custom hooks (e.g. `useAuth()` for authentication logic, `useToggle()` for toggling boolean state) ([React TypeScript Folder Structure To Follow | Stackademic](https://stackademic.com/blog/react-typescript-folder-structure-to-follow-ae614e786f8a#:~:text=hooks%3A)). Prefix hook filenames with “use” and use camelCase (e.g. `useFetchData.ts`).  
**Types**: Global TypeScript types (could also organize types by feature, but a central folder helps avoid circular imports). For instance, define `types/User.ts` for a User interface if the API returns user objects.  
**Utils**: General utilities (e.g. date formatters, calculation helpers).  
**Assets**: (if needed) for static assets like images or icons (though with MUI, many icons are via @mui/icons-material).

This structure follows a **feature-based** approach, separating concerns and making it easy to locate code. For example, by isolating API calls in `services/`, you can update how HTTP requests work (authentication, error handling, etc.) in one place ([React TypeScript Folder Structure To Follow | Stackademic](https://stackademic.com/blog/react-typescript-folder-structure-to-follow-ae614e786f8a#:~:text=api%20%26%20services%3A)). Keep components presentational where possible and delegate data fetching or business logic to services or hooks – this makes components easier to test and reuse.

With the project scaffolded, linting in place, and structure organized, you have a robust foundation to start building features.

## 2. **State Management**

Managing application state in a predictable way is essential, especially as the app grows. We will use **Redux Toolkit** for global client state (like authentication info or UI state) and **React Query** for server state (data from the API). These tools handle different needs: Redux is excellent for client-side state and complex state logic, while React Query simplifies data fetching and caching.

### **Redux Toolkit Configuration**

Redux Toolkit (RTK) reduces boilerplate and provides sane defaults for Redux. Start by setting up a Redux store. Create a file `src/store/index.ts`:

```ts
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import authReducer from "./authSlice";
// import other reducers as the app grows

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    auth: authReducer,
    // other slice reducers...
  },
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
```

Here we configure the store with a mapping of slice reducers. RTK’s `configureStore` abstracts the standard Redux store creation and automatically sets up the Redux DevTools extension and middleware ([A Guide To Redux Toolkit With TypeScript — Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/05/guide-redux-toolkit-typescript/#:~:text=2,the%20calls%20and%20provides%20a)). Next, create a slice, e.g., for authentication in `src/store/authSlice.ts`:

```ts
import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

interface AuthState {
  user: any | null;
  token: string | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}
const initialState: AuthState = {
  user: null,
  token: null,
  isAuthenticated: false,
};

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: "auth",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    loginSuccess: (
      state,
      action: PayloadAction<{ user: any; token: string }>
    ) => {
      state.user = action.payload.user;
      state.token = action.payload.token;
      state.isAuthenticated = true;
    },
    logout: (state) => {
      state.user = null;
      state.token = null;
      state.isAuthenticated = false;
    },
    // ... (additional reducers like updateProfile if needed)
  },
});

export const { loginSuccess, logout } = authSlice.actions;
export default authSlice.reducer;
```

This uses `createSlice` to define a slice of state and its reducers in one go. The **name** is used as the Redux action prefix, **initialState** defines state shape, and **reducers** field automatically generates action creators and action types for each case ([A Guide To Redux Toolkit With TypeScript — Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/05/guide-redux-toolkit-typescript/#:~:text=1,function.%20It)) ([A Guide To Redux Toolkit With TypeScript — Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/05/guide-redux-toolkit-typescript/#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Part%203%20export%20const,)). We have `loginSuccess` to store user info and JWT on login, and `logout` to clear state. With this, Redux Toolkit under the hood creates action types like `"auth/loginSuccess"` and the corresponding action creator.

Now integrate the store in your app. In your entry file (e.g., `main.tsx` or `index.tsx` in src), wrap the `<App />` with `<Provider store={store}>` from `react-redux`:

```tsx
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./store";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!);
root.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);
```

This provides the Redux store to all React components. You can now use `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks from react-redux in components to read state or dispatch actions.

For asynchronous logic, Redux Toolkit offers **createAsyncThunk** (for fetching data or other side effects) and even an advanced integrated data fetching tool called **RTK Query**. However, in this guide we’ll use React Query for data fetching, so we may not need `createAsyncThunk` except for complex sequences or non-REST side effects. In cases where you want to use Redux for API calls, `createAsyncThunk` can dispatch pending/fulfilled/rejected actions automatically around an async call ([A Guide To Redux Toolkit With TypeScript — Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/05/guide-redux-toolkit-typescript/#:~:text=Provider,standardised%20way%20to%20handle%20errors)).

**When to use Redux**: Use it for states that are not just cached server data – e.g., authentication status, UI toggles (dark mode setting, modals), or complex client logic. Redux Toolkit’s slices keep this organized and type-safe, and the Redux DevTools let you trace state changes easily in development.

### **Setting up React Query**

For server-provided data (like lists of records from the MySQL API), **React Query (TanStack Query)** is a powerful solution. It handles caching, background refetching, and updating stale data with far less code than manually managing loading and error state in Redux or useEffect ([React Query: Making Your Server-State Problems Disappear (Like Magic) - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sathish/react-query-making-your-server-state-problems-disappear-like-magic-2fjn#:~:text=,what%20matters%3A%20building%20your%20app)).

First, set up the React Query context provider at the root. Install if not already: `npm i @tanstack/react-query`. In your entry file (around `<App />`):

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();
root.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </Provider>
);
```

Wrapping the app with `QueryClientProvider` makes React Query's cache available. We initialized a default QueryClient which holds configuration like cache time, retry logic, etc., using sensible defaults.

Now you can use the hooks `useQuery` and `useMutation` in components to fetch and modify data. **React Query usage example**: create a hook or directly in a component to fetch, say, a list of products:

```ts
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { getProducts } from "../services/productService";

function ProductList() {
  const {
    data: products,
    error,
    isLoading,
  } = useQuery(
    ["products"], // unique key for this query
    getProducts // function that returns a promise (e.g., axios get)
  );

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error loading products!</div>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {products?.map((p) => (
        <li key={p.id}>{p.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useQuery` with key `'products'` will call `getProducts()` (which should be an async function in our service). React Query manages the loading and error state automatically and caches the result ([React Query: Making Your Server-State Problems Disappear (Like Magic) - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sathish/react-query-making-your-server-state-problems-disappear-like-magic-2fjn#:~:text=,what%20matters%3A%20building%20your%20app)). If the component unmounts and remounts quickly, it can return cached data immediately, making the UI feel snappy. By default, data is treated as **stale-while-revalidate** – meaning React Query will return cached data instantly and re-fetch in the background to update if it's outdated ([React Query: Making Your Server-State Problems Disappear (Like Magic) - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sathish/react-query-making-your-server-state-problems-disappear-like-magic-2fjn#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20how%20it%20works%3A)). The default cache time is 5 minutes, but this is configurable.

**Data mutations**: For creating or updating data via the API, use `useMutation`. For example, in a form submission (we will see this in the CRUD section), you can call `useMutation(createProduct)` and then manually invalidate the `'products'` query cache using `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['products'])` to refetch the list with the new product ([React Query: Making Your Server-State Problems Disappear (Like Magic) - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sathish/react-query-making-your-server-state-problems-disappear-like-magic-2fjn#:~:text=Cache%20Invalidation%3A%20Making%20Sure%20Your,Is%20Fresh%20as%20a%20Daisy)).

**React Query vs Redux**: They serve different purposes. React Query is specifically optimized for **server state** – data that comes from an external source and might be stale or need refetching. It spares you from writing extra Redux boilerplate for loading flags, error storage, caching, etc. Redux, on the other hand, excels at representing client state and orchestrating complex updates. In many projects, using both is beneficial: Redux for things like current user info and UI state, and React Query for remote data. They can work together (for instance, you might store the auth token in Redux, and React Query’s fetch functions can pull it from Redux or a global variable to include in API calls).

At this point, our app has a state management foundation: a Redux store for global state and React Query for API data. Next, we’ll integrate the API calls using Axios and handle authentication.

## 3. **API Integration with Axios**

Integrating the MySQL-based API involves setting up a reliable layer to make HTTP requests. We’ll use **Axios** for its convenient API and features like interceptors. Proper error handling and authentication are key: we want to globally handle issues like network errors or authorization failures. Here’s how to set up an Axios instance and integrate it with our state management:

### **Axios Instance Configuration**

Create a file `src/services/apiClient.ts` (or `http.ts`) to configure Axios. By centralizing configuration, you avoid repeating base URLs or headers in every request and can apply universal logic (like attaching auth tokens).

```ts
import axios from "axios";
import { store } from "../store"; // if you need to access Redux state for token

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || "https://api.example.com", // base URL of your API
  timeout: 10000, // 10 seconds timeout for requests
});
```

Set the `baseURL` to your API server’s address (possibly loaded from an environment variable for flexibility). Next, add **request interceptors** to include the JWT token on every request after login:

```ts
apiClient.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    const token = store.getState().auth.token;
    if (token && config.headers) {
      config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    }
    return config;
  },
  (error) => {
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

This interceptor runs before every request and adds an `Authorization` header if a token is available. We retrieve the token from Redux state here. _(Alternatively, you could store the token in localStorage and read from there, but accessing Redux state keeps it in memory and in sync.)_ Using Axios interceptors lets us avoid attaching tokens manually to each API call ([JWT Authentication using Axios interceptors | Mihai Andrei](https://mihai-andrei.com/blog/jwt-authentication-using-axios-interceptors/#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Add%20request%20interceptor%20this,return%20config%3B)) ([JWT Authentication using Axios interceptors | Mihai Andrei](https://mihai-andrei.com/blog/jwt-authentication-using-axios-interceptors/#:~:text=this.axiosInstance.interceptors.request.use%28%20%28config%29%20%3D,Promise.reject%28error)).

Now add a **response interceptor** to handle errors globally:

```ts
apiClient.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    const { response } = error;
    if (response) {
      if (response.status === 401) {
        // Unauthorized error - token might be invalid/expired
        // Option: dispatch a logout action, or attempt token refresh if refresh token available
        store.dispatch({ type: "auth/logout" });
        // You might also redirect to login page if using react-router:
        // window.location.href = '/login';
      }
      // You can handle other status codes globally if needed (403, 500, etc.)
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

This interceptor checks if the server responded with a 401 Unauthorized. In that case, we dispatch a logout (which clears state) and optionally redirect to the login page. This way, if an API call fails due to an expired token, the user is forced to re-authenticate. In a more advanced setup, you could attempt a **refresh token** flow here: if you have a refresh token, call a refresh API endpoint, update the token, and retry the original request ([JWT Authentication using Axios interceptors | Mihai Andrei](https://mihai-andrei.com/blog/jwt-authentication-using-axios-interceptors/#:~:text=if%20%28%20error,this.isRefreshing%20%3D%20true)) ([JWT Authentication using Axios interceptors | Mihai Andrei](https://mihai-andrei.com/blog/jwt-authentication-using-axios-interceptors/#:~:text=try%20,refreshToken)). That logic can be complex, but Axios interceptors are powerful enough to handle it (queuing requests while refreshing, etc.). For simplicity, we’ll use the logout approach and assume the user must log in again if their session expires.

With Axios configured, export `apiClient` and use it for all requests:

```ts
export default apiClient;
```

### **Creating API Service Functions**

Instead of using `apiClient.get('/users')` scattered in components, it’s better to encapsulate API calls in service functions. This improves maintainability and testability. For example, create `src/services/userService.ts`:

```ts
import apiClient from "./apiClient";
import { User } from "../types/User";

export async function getUsers(): Promise<User[]> {
  const response = await apiClient.get("/users");
  return response.data;
}

export async function createUser(data: User): Promise<User> {
  const response = await apiClient.post("/users", data);
  return response.data;
}

// ... updateUser, deleteUser as needed
```

Similarly, if you have other entities (products, orders, etc.), create service modules for each. By doing this, components (or React Query hooks) can just call these functions. This keeps Axios usage in one place. It also makes it easy to mock these functions in tests, or swap out implementation if the API changes.

**Using the service in React Query**: As seen, `useQuery('users', getUsers)` will call our `getUsers` function. If `getUsers` throws (Axios will throw on HTTP errors by default), React Query will catch it and populate the `error` state. We already set up the response interceptor to handle 401 globally; for other errors, you might show a message. You can also use `try/catch` around service calls if using them outside of React Query (like in Redux thunks or other logic).

**Error Handling UX**: For a better user experience, implement a global error alert or toast. For example, you can use a React Context or even Redux to store error messages and a `<Snackbar>` from Material UI to display them. The response interceptor could dispatch an action with `error.response.data.message` (if API provides error messages) and a generic message for network errors (when `!response`). Then an ErrorToast component subscribed to that store slice can show a notification. This way, API errors are handled in one spot, rather than every API call manually checking for errors.

In summary, our API integration approach is: use a shared Axios instance with auth and error interceptors, and define reusable functions for all CRUD operations. This yields cleaner components and one place to maintain API interaction logic ([JWT Authentication using Axios interceptors | Mihai Andrei](https://mihai-andrei.com/blog/jwt-authentication-using-axios-interceptors/#:~:text=I%20like%20to%20keep%20all,calls%20used%20in%20the%20app)).

## 4. **Building CRUD Forms**

Creating forms for Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) operations is a common task. We will use **Material UI** components for the UI, **React Hook Form (RHF)** to manage form state, and **Yup** for schema validation. This combination allows building complex forms with minimal code while ensuring validation rules are enforced consistently ([How I use React Hook Form with Yup and TypeScript - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dicky54putra/how-i-react-hook-form-with-yup-and-typescript-1hk7#:~:text=React%20Hook%20Form%20is%20a,Form%20with%20Yup%20and%20TypeScript)).

### **Form Validation Schema with Yup**

For each form (e.g., a user registration form, product create form, etc.), define a Yup schema describing the validation rules. For instance, imagine a form to add a new _Product_ with fields: name (string, required), price (number, required, positive), and description (string, optional):

```ts
import * as yup from "yup";

export const productSchema = yup.object({
  name: yup.string().required("Name is required"),
  price: yup
    .number()
    .typeError("Price must be a number")
    .positive("Price must be positive")
    .required("Price is required"),
  description: yup.string().max(500, "Description too long"),
});
```

This schema will be used to validate form data. Each field has rules: `name` and `price` are required, price must be numeric and > 0, etc. The messages provided will appear if the rule fails. We can derive a TypeScript type from this schema if needed using `yup.InferType<typeof productSchema>` for strong typing of form data.

### **Creating a Reusable Form Component**

Let's create a form component using React Hook Form and Material UI. First, install the necessary packages if not already: `npm i react-hook-form yup @hookform/resolvers`. We already did this in setup, but note that `@hookform/resolvers` provides the glue to use Yup with RHF.

In `src/components/ProductForm.tsx`:

```tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { yupResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/yup";
import { productSchema } from "../utils/validationSchemas";
import { TextField, Button, Box } from "@mui/material";
import { createProduct } from "../services/productService";
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";

type ProductFormInputs = {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description?: string;
};

const defaultValues: ProductFormInputs = {
  name: "",
  price: 0,
  description: "",
};

export default function ProductForm() {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    reset,
    formState: { errors, isSubmitting },
  } = useForm<ProductFormInputs>({
    defaultValues,
    resolver: yupResolver(productSchema), // integrate Yup schema for validation
  });

  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const { mutateAsync } = useMutation(createProduct, {
    onSuccess: (newProduct) => {
      // Invalidate or update the "products" list cache to include the new product
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(["products"]);
    },
  });

  const onSubmit = async (data: ProductFormInputs) => {
    try {
      await mutateAsync(data);
      reset(); // clear form on success
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to save product", error);
      // optionally set global error state for a toast
    }
  };

  return (
    <Box component="form" onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      <TextField
        label="Name"
        variant="outlined"
        fullWidth
        {...register("name")}
        error={!!errors.name}
        helperText={errors.name?.message}
        sx={{ mb: 2 }}
      />
      <TextField

        variant="outlined"
        type="number"
        fullWidth
        {...register("price")}
        error={!!errors.price}
        helperText={errors.price?.message}
        sx={{ mb: 2 }}
      />
      <TextField

        error={!!errors.description}
        helperText={errors.description?.message}
        sx={{ mb: 2 }}

        type="submit"

        disabled={isSubmitting}
      >
        {isSubmitting ? "Submitting..." : "Submit"}
      </Button>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

Let’s break down what’s happening here:

- We use `useForm` from React Hook Form to manage the form state. We pass a generic type `ProductFormInputs` to `useForm` to get typed values. We also provide `defaultValues` and a **resolver**: `yupResolver(productSchema)` connects our Yup schema to RHF, so RHF will run validation using Yup for us ([How I use React Hook Form with Yup and TypeScript - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dicky54putra/how-i-react-hook-form-with-yup-and-typescript-1hk7#:~:text=const%20form%20%3D%20useForm%28,resolver%29%2C)).
- We destructure `register`, `handleSubmit`, `reset`, and `formState` from `useForm`.
  - `register` is used to connect input fields to the form state. We spread `...register('name')` into the TextField, which attaches the appropriate `onChange`, `onBlur`, `ref`, and value handlers.
  - `formState.errors` contains any validation errors for fields (populated after touching fields or on submit).
  - `formState.isSubmitting` is true while the form is in the process of being submitted (useful to disable the submit button and show a loading state).
- Each **TextField** from MUI is configured with the `error` prop (boolean) and `helperText` to display validation messages if present ([How I use React Hook Form with Yup and TypeScript - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dicky54putra/how-i-react-hook-form-with-yup-and-typescript-1hk7#:~:text=...%20%3CInputField%20%7B...form.register%28,form.formState.isSubmitting%7D%20required)). For example, if the user leaves Name empty and blurs, `errors.name?.message` might be "Name is required" from our schema, and the TextField will show that message.
- We use React Query’s `useMutation` for the create API call. The `createProduct` service function is passed in, and we specify an `onSuccess` callback to invalidate the "products" query cache so that the product list will refetch (or we could optimistically update the cache).
- The form’s `onSubmit` handler (wrapped by RHF’s `handleSubmit`) calls `mutateAsync` to create the product. We `reset()` the form to default values on success, clearing it for a new entry.
- We disable the submit button and change its text when `isSubmitting` is true, giving immediate feedback that the submission is in progress ([How I use React Hook Form with Yup and TypeScript - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dicky54putra/how-i-react-hook-form-with-yup-and-typescript-1hk7#:~:text=6)).

Using React Hook Form in this way provides performance benefits – it uses uncontrolled form inputs under the hood and only triggers re-renders on specific events, rather than on every keystroke as a React `useState` managed form might. Even with many fields, RHF scales well.

**Validation UX**: Yup and RHF integration means validation runs on submit by default (and on blur/change for touched fields). You can configure `mode: 'onChange'` in `useForm` if you want live validation feedback. The error messages from Yup appear under the fields automatically as we wired up. This ensures the user gets immediate feedback if something is wrong, and prevents invalid data from ever being sent to the API.

**Material UI Integration**: We directly spread `register()` onto MUI TextField. This works because MUI's TextField passes unknown props to the underlying input element. Alternatively, RHF provides a `<Controller>` component for cases where you need more control or for complex components (like a third-party date picker). But for basic inputs, spreading register is concise. Each TextField is wrapped in MUI styling and will automatically show as an error with red outline when the `error` prop is true.

You can create similar forms for editing existing records. For an edit form, you might call `useForm({ defaultValues: existingData })` to preload the form, and use a `useMutation(updateXYZ)` for submission.

This approach results in less repetitive code: all field validations are in the schema (no need to manually check each field in onSubmit), and RHF manages the form state and interactions. The combination of RHF + Yup is a **robust solution for building and validating forms** with type safety ([How I use React Hook Form with Yup and TypeScript - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dicky54putra/how-i-react-hook-form-with-yup-and-typescript-1hk7#:~:text=React%20Hook%20Form%20is%20a,Form%20with%20Yup%20and%20TypeScript)).

## 5. **Authentication & Authorization**

In this section, we'll implement **JWT-based authentication** for our React app, including user login, storing tokens, and protecting routes. We will also handle **role-based authorization** so that certain parts of the app are accessible only to users with specific roles (e.g., admin). React Router will be used to restrict routes.

### **JWT Authentication Flow**

**Login Process**: Typically, your MySQL-backed API will have an endpoint for authentication (e.g., `/api/login` that expects a username/password and returns a JWT on success). We will create a login form (using the same RHF approach) and send credentials via Axios.

Steps for login:

1. User enters credentials in a login form and submits.
2. The app calls `apiClient.post('/login', credentials)` via a service function (e.g., `authService.login(credentials)`).
3. On success, the API returns a JWT (and possibly user info and a refresh token). We dispatch `loginSuccess` action to Redux with the user info and token.
4. The Redux `auth` slice updates `state.auth.isAuthenticated` to true and stores the token. Our Axios interceptor will automatically start using that token for subsequent requests (since it reads from `store.getState().auth.token`).
5. We may also persist the token (and maybe user data) in localStorage so the user stays logged in on page refresh. This can be done in the loginSuccess reducer or via a listener: e.g., use Redux Persist or manually do `localStorage.setItem('token', token)` and load it on app start.

For example, an `authService.ts`:

```ts
export async function login(credentials: { email: string; password: string }) {
  const { data } = await apiClient.post("/login", credentials);
  // assuming data = { user: {...}, token: 'jwt-token-string' }
  return data;
}
```

And in a React component or a Redux thunk:

```ts
try {
  const { user, token } = await login({ email, password });
  dispatch(loginSuccess({ user, token }));
} catch (err) {
  // handle login error (show message to user)
}
```

Once logged in, the user’s auth state is in Redux and the token is set. We should also handle **logout**: clear the token from Redux (and storage) and possibly inform the server (though with JWT, usually server just relies on token expiry).

**Storing Tokens**: We chose to keep the token in Redux state (and localStorage for persistence). Storing JWT in localStorage is common, but note it's vulnerable to XSS attacks (if an attacker can run JS on your site, they could retrieve the token). A more secure alternative is to store the token in an HTTP-only cookie set by the server. However, that requires server support and handling CSRF. Given our context, we'll use localStorage for simplicity, but be aware of the trade-offs.

After a user logs in, they can access protected API routes (Axios will send the JWT). We also want to restrict front-end routes.

### **Protected Routes with React Router**

We will use React Router (v6) to define routes and create a **ProtectedRoute** component to guard private pages.

Install React Router if not already: `npm i react-router-dom`. In your routing configuration (could be in App.tsx or a separate routes component):

```tsx
import {
  BrowserRouter,
  Routes,
  Route,
  Navigate,
  Outlet,
} from "react-router-dom";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import LoginPage from "./pages/LoginPage";
import Dashboard from "./pages/Dashboard";
// ... other imports

function ProtectedRoute() {
  const isAuthenticated = useSelector(
    (state: RootState) => state.auth.isAuthenticated
  );
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    // If not logged in, redirect to login page
    return <Navigate to="/login" replace />;
  }
  // If logged in, render the outlet (child routes)
  return <Outlet />;
}

export default function AppRoutes() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/login" element={<LoginPage />} />
        {/* Protected routes */}
        <Route element={<ProtectedRoute />}>
          <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
          <Route path="/settings" element={<SettingsPage />} />
          {/* ...other protected routes... */}
        </Route>
        <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/dashboard" />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

In this setup, any route that is a child of `<ProtectedRoute>` will only render if the user is authenticated. The `<ProtectedRoute>` component uses `useSelector` to get `state.auth.isAuthenticated`. If false, it redirects to `/login` ([JWT Authentication in React with react-router - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sanjayttg/jwt-authentication-in-react-with-react-router-1d03#:~:text=,dom)). If true, it renders an `<Outlet />`, which means "render whatever child routes are here" (e.g., Dashboard, Settings). This pattern prevents unauthorized access to those routes. Trying to navigate to `/dashboard` while not logged in will immediately redirect to `/login`.

The state for `isAuthenticated` is updated on login/logout via Redux, so this works reactively — after a successful login, `isAuthenticated` becomes true, and if the user then navigates to a protected route, they’ll be allowed.

We should ensure that on app load, if a token exists in localStorage (from a previous session) and is valid, we dispatch an action to set `isAuthenticated` true and load the user info (perhaps by calling a "get current user" API endpoint). This is often done in an `App.jsx` useEffect or similar, to persist login state on refresh.

### **Role-Based Authorization**

If your application has user roles (e.g., regular user vs admin), you can restrict certain routes or UI elements based on roles. Suppose the user object has a `role` field (like `"admin"` or `"user"`). We can enhance ProtectedRoute or create a separate component for role-based checks.

One approach is to pass allowed roles as a prop to a route guard component:

```tsx
function RoleProtectedRoute({ allowedRoles }: { allowedRoles: string[] }) {
  const { isAuthenticated, user } = useSelector(
    (state: RootState) => state.auth
  );
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <Navigate to="/login" replace />;
  }
  const userHasRequiredRole = user && allowedRoles.includes(user.role);
  if (!userHasRequiredRole) {
    return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" replace />; // or render a <NotAuthorized /> component
  }
  return <Outlet />;
}
```

Then define routes like:

```tsx
<Route element={<RoleProtectedRoute allowedRoles={["admin"]} />}>
  <Route path="/admin-panel" element={<AdminPanel />} />
</Route>
```

In this case, even an authenticated user will be redirected if their role isn’t in the allowed list ([Role Based Authorization with React Router v6 and Typescript | Adarsha Acharya](https://www.adarsha.dev/blog/role-based-auth-with-react-router-v6#:~:text=if%20%28%21isAuthenticated%29%20%7B%20return%20,)) ([Role Based Authorization with React Router v6 and Typescript | Adarsha Acharya](https://www.adarsha.dev/blog/role-based-auth-with-react-router-v6#:~:text=In%20PrivateRoute%20we%20check%20the,variable)). You might have a dedicated “Unauthorized” page to show a friendly message if someone tries to access a page they shouldn’t.

For example, if a user with role "user" tries to access `/admin-panel`, `userHasRequiredRole` will be false and we redirect them (or display a message). This ensures only admins see the admin panel. Similarly, you can hide navigation links based on role (e.g., don’t show the "Admin" menu item if `user.role !== 'admin'`).

On the backend, of course, you must still enforce these permissions (never rely solely on front-end checks), but doing it in the front-end improves user experience by not even giving the option to access disallowed sections.

### **Maintaining Session and Logout**

We touched on storing the JWT and rehydrating on page refresh. To implement that:

- On app startup, check `localStorage.getItem('token')`. If present, you might optimistically set it in Axios default headers and dispatch an action to mark as authenticated. Ideally, verify it by calling an API (like `/me`) to fetch the current user's profile using that token. If that call succeeds, user is logged in and you get their data; if not, the token was invalid/expired and you clear it.
- Use `useEffect` in a top-level component (App) to perform this check on mount.

For logout:

- A logout button or action should dispatch `logout` (Redux slice will handle clearing state) and also remove the token from localStorage. The Axios interceptor will then no longer send a token.

We already set our response interceptor to handle expired tokens by logging out ([JWT Authentication using Axios interceptors | Mihai Andrei](https://mihai-andrei.com/blog/jwt-authentication-using-axios-interceptors/#:~:text=if%20%28%20error,this.isRefreshing%20%3D%20true)). After logout, React Router will prevent access to protected routes (since `isAuthenticated` is false). You might also programmatically navigate the user to the login screen on logout (e.g., in the logout function, call `navigate('/login')` using `useNavigate` from react-router).

**Summary**: We built a login system using JWT where the token is stored in Redux (and localStorage). We created a ProtectedRoute to guard private routes ([JWT Authentication in React with react-router - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sanjayttg/jwt-authentication-in-react-with-react-router-1d03#:~:text=,dom)). For role-based authorization, we extended the logic to check user roles before allowing access ([Role Based Authorization with React Router v6 and Typescript | Adarsha Acharya](https://www.adarsha.dev/blog/role-based-auth-with-react-router-v6#:~:text=if%20%28%21isAuthenticated%29%20%7B%20return%20,)). Our Axios instance ensures that all API calls include the JWT for auth, and handles the scenario of an expired token by logging the user out. Together, these measures implement a secure authentication flow on the frontend. Remember that client-side protection is mostly for UX; always validate JWTs and permissions on the server as well.

## 6. **Advanced Material UI Theming**

Material UI (MUI) comes with a robust theming system that allows global customization of components and easy switching between light and dark modes. In this section, we'll customize the theme to fit our application's branding, implement a Dark Mode toggle, and discuss best practices for global styles.

### **Creating a Custom Theme**

Material UI’s theme is an object that defines design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) and component styling options. By customizing it, you ensure a consistent look across the app. Start by creating a theme file, e.g. `src/theme.ts`:

```ts
import { createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";

export const lightTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: "light",
    primary: {
      main: "#1976d2", // your brand color
    },
    secondary: {
      main: "#dc004e",
    },
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: "Roboto, Arial, sans-serif",
  },
  components: {
    // Global component styles
    MuiButton: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          textTransform: "none", // disable uppercase transform on buttons
        },
      },
      defaultProps: {
        disableRipple: true, // example: disable ripple effect globally
      },
    },
    // ... override other components as needed
  },
});
```

This example customizes the primary and secondary colors and some Button styles. The theme can include many options:

- **Palette**: Colors for primary, secondary, error, warning, info, success, and modes (light/dark) etc. We set `mode: 'light'` here for a light theme. MUI will use different default colors for light vs dark mode (e.g., backgrounds) ([Theming - Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/?srsltid=AfmBOoqnb6Y4lBPNOZZrQmfOy07nzPD2NRFrUI4b4vS-4aIjX1xHyY17#:~:text=all%20design%20aspects%20of%20your,of%20your%20business%20or%20brand)).
- **Typography**: Define global font family, font sizes, etc.
- **Components**: This allows overriding default styles or props of MUI components globally. In the example, we remove the all-caps style on Button and disable ripples by default.

Similarly, define a `darkTheme` by spreading the light theme and changing mode and maybe colors:

```ts
export const darkTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: "dark",
    primary: {
      main: "#90caf9",
    },
    secondary: {
      main: "#f48fb1",
    },
    background: {
      default: "#121212", // dark background
      paper: "#1e1e1e",
    },
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: "Roboto, Arial, sans-serif",
  },
  components: {
    // ... (you can reuse styleOverrides from lightTheme if same)
    MuiButton: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          textTransform: "none",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Usually, for dark theme you adjust the palette (lighter primary/secondary to contrast dark background, and set the default background to a dark color). MUI’s dark mode automatically adjusts component internals (e.g., text will become white by default on dark backgrounds), but you can further tune it.

To use these themes, wrap your app (or at least the parts using MUI components) in a `<ThemeProvider>`:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider, CssBaseline } from "@mui/material";
import { lightTheme, darkTheme } from "./theme";
import AppRoutes from "./AppRoutes";

function App() {
  const [mode, setMode] = useState<"light" | "dark">("light");

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setMode((prev) => (prev === "light" ? "dark" : "light"));
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={mode === "light" ? lightTheme : darkTheme}>
      <CssBaseline />
      <Navbar onToggleTheme={toggleTheme} />
      <AppRoutes />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

In this example, we manage the theme mode in state and toggle between `lightTheme` and `darkTheme`. We include `<CssBaseline />` which is a MUI component that adds a set of baseline CSS styles (like a CSS reset plus default theming for typography) – this ensures our app starts with a consistent base across different browsers.

**ThemeProvider** uses React context to pass the theme to all MUI components in the subtree ([Theming - Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/?srsltid=AfmBOoqnb6Y4lBPNOZZrQmfOy07nzPD2NRFrUI4b4vS-4aIjX1xHyY17#:~:text=Material%C2%A0UI%20components%20adhere%20to%20the,custom%20theme%20into%20your%20application)). Any styled MUI component will use the nearest theme available. By wrapping at the root, we ensure the whole app uses our theme. The theme provides a consistent color scheme, typography, spacing, etc., which gives the app a professional and unified appearance ([Theming - Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/?srsltid=AfmBOoqnb6Y4lBPNOZZrQmfOy07nzPD2NRFrUI4b4vS-4aIjX1xHyY17#:~:text=The%20theme%20specifies%20the%20color,opacity%20of%20ink%20elements%2C%20etc)).

### **Implementing Dark Mode**

As shown, toggling dark mode is as simple as swapping the theme object. We keep a toggle (perhaps a button or switch in the Navbar) that calls `setMode`. When `mode` state changes, the ThemeProvider picks the corresponding theme. All components respond to the change automatically because they use the theme values for colors. For example, Material UI’s components will switch to using `palette.primary.main` from the new theme – if you provided different values for dark mode, those take effect.

MUI also supports reading the system color scheme preference. The hook `useMediaQuery('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` can tell you if the user’s OS prefers dark mode ([Dark mode - Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/?srsltid=AfmBOoocCpubX7PqgLU9OmZlQ7vbyvlnyaamIl7eyWOOqP9xKhSPYQol#:~:text=function%20App%28%29%20,div%3E%3B)). You could use this on initial load to decide the default theme. Additionally, you might want to persist the chosen theme mode (e.g., in localStorage) so that the user’s preference is remembered.

The key is that by using the theming system, switching dark mode doesn’t require adding/removing CSS classes manually – it’s a single state change. MUI handles the styling differences mostly by changing the palette mode.

**Customizing Components**: In the theme, the `components` section can be used for deeper customizations. For example, you could create a new variant of a Button or override styles of the TextField globally (like setting the border radius globally for inputs, etc.). This avoids needing to style each component individually throughout your app. Instead, you declare “All Buttons should have border-radius 8px” once in the theme.

For example:

```ts
components: {
  MuiPaper: {
    styleOverrides: {
      root: {
        borderRadius: 8,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This would give all Paper components (including Cards, Modals, etc. which use Paper) a rounded corner look.

### **Global Styling Best Practices**

While MUI’s theme covers component styling, sometimes you need global CSS (like for non-MUI elements, or html/body). Use `CssBaseline` (as included above) to handle a lot of this, as it applies a consistent base style (it sets background and text colors based on theme, etc.). If you need additional global styles, MUI provides a `<GlobalStyles>` component where you can define styles at the top level, or you can have a separate CSS file.

However, avoid heavily overriding MUI styles with plain CSS. It’s better to use the theme or styled API:

- Use the `sx` prop or `styled()` utility to apply custom styles that still respect the theme (e.g., `sx={{ marginTop: 2, color: 'primary.main' }}` uses theme spacing and colors).
- Keep your custom CSS classes minimal. When needed (e.g., an entire custom layout or third-party component integration), define them carefully to not conflict with MUI’s classes.

For fonts, you can include a link to Google Fonts in `index.html` or use `@font-face` in CSS, then set the font in the theme’s typography. We did `fontFamily: 'Roboto, Arial, sans-serif'` since Roboto is MUI’s default font (loaded by default in older MUI versions via FontLink component, but in MUI v5 you need to import it or use your own font).

**Dark mode specifics**: In dark mode, certain adjustments might be needed for custom components. MUI’s palette will automatically make `<Paper>` background slightly lighter than default background, etc. If you have custom elements, ensure their style adapts (you can use `theme.palette.mode` inside styled components to change styles based on light/dark). MUI documentation suggests using the `theme.applyStyles` utility or checking `theme.palette.mode` for conditional styling ([Dark mode - Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/?srsltid=AfmBOoocCpubX7PqgLU9OmZlQ7vbyvlnyaamIl7eyWOOqP9xKhSPYQol#:~:text=Toggling%20color%20mode)) ([Dark mode - Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/?srsltid=AfmBOoocCpubX7PqgLU9OmZlQ7vbyvlnyaamIl7eyWOOqP9xKhSPYQol#:~:text=Styling%20in%20dark%20mode)).

By leveraging the theming system, you achieve:

- **Consistency**: same spacing scale, font usage, and color references throughout.
- **Maintainability**: update a color or spacing in one place (the theme) to affect the whole app.
- **Dark mode support**: via a toggle that swaps theme objects (or even using MUI’s built-in color scheme toggling hooks for more advanced scenarios).

Finally, wrap up theming best practices:

- Use the theme’s spacing instead of arbitrary margins/paddings (e.g., theme.spacing(2) equals 16px if default 8px unit – when using `sx`, you can give numbers which are multiplied by theme.spacing unit).
- Use theme palette colors for texts and backgrounds to ensure adequate contrast (MUI’s dark/light palettes are designed for contrast).
- Test both light and dark modes to make sure all text is readable (sometimes you may need to tweak e.g., a custom chart or map component to switch its styling).

Now our app has a customizable look. We implemented a theme with brand colors, ensured components like buttons reflect our style globally, and added a dark mode that can be toggled easily. MUI’s theming capability allows applying a consistent tone to your app and switching between light/dark modes as needed ([Theming - Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/?srsltid=AfmBOoqnb6Y4lBPNOZZrQmfOy07nzPD2NRFrUI4b4vS-4aIjX1xHyY17#:~:text=The%20theme%20specifies%20the%20color,opacity%20of%20ink%20elements%2C%20etc)).

## 7. **Testing Strategies**

Testing is crucial to maintain a robust application. We will use **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and integration tests, and **Cypress** for end-to-end tests. Each type of test serves a purpose:

- **Unit tests** check individual functions or components in isolation.
- **Integration tests** verify that multiple units work together (for example, a component with context, or a form that calls an API).
- **End-to-end (E2E) tests** simulate real user scenarios in a browser, ensuring the entire app (frontend and backend) works as expected.

Let's explore each, with tips and best practices.

### **Unit Testing with Jest and React Testing Library**

**Jest** is a popular test runner that comes with Create React App by default. If using Vite, you can configure Jest or use Vitest for similar capabilities. **React Testing Library (RTL)** provides utilities to render components and interact with them in a way that reflects user interactions. Its guiding principle: _tests should resemble how users use the app_ ([React Testing Library | Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/#:~:text=,confidence%20they%20can%20give%20you)).

Set up: ensure Jest is configured in package.json (CRA has it out of the box). With Vite, add a `vite.config.ts` for testing or use a Vitest setup. Also, include `@testing-library/jest-dom` to get custom matchers (like `toBeInTheDocument()`).

**Testing a Component**: As an example, test the ProductForm component we made:

```tsx
// ProductForm.test.tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from "@testing-library/react";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { store } from "../store";
import ProductForm from "./ProductForm";

test("submitting ProductForm calls API and resets form", async () => {
  // Render with providers (since ProductForm uses Redux and React Query)
  const queryClient = new QueryClient();
  render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <ProductForm />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </Provider>
  );

  // Find input fields and button
  const nameInput = screen.getByLabelText(/name/i);
  const priceInput = screen.getByLabelText(/price/i);
  const submitButton = screen.getByRole("button", { name: /submit/i });

  // Fill out the form
  fireEvent.change(nameInput, { target: { value: "Test Product" } });
  fireEvent.change(priceInput, { target: { value: "50" } });

  // Submit the form
  fireEvent.click(submitButton);

  // Wait for the form submission (the button text changes to 'Submitting...' on submit)
  expect(await screen.findByText(/submitting.../i)).toBeInTheDocument();

  // Wait for the success state - form should reset, meaning the name input should be blank again eventually
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect((screen.getByLabelText(/name/i) as HTMLInputElement).value).toBe("");
  });
});
```

In this test, we:

- Render the component with required context providers (Redux store and QueryClientProvider) to match our environment.
- Use Testing Library's queries to get form elements (by label text for inputs, by role and text for the button). This mimics how a user identifies elements (by visible labels) ([React Testing Library | Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/#:~:text=will%20work%20with%20actual%20DOM,sense%20or%20is%20not%20practical)).
- Use `fireEvent.change` to simulate typing into inputs, and `fireEvent.click` to simulate a button press.
- We then wait for expected outcomes. We expect the "Submitting..." text to appear (meaning our button disabled state engaged). Then we wait for the form to reset and check that the name input's value is ''. We use `waitFor` because the submission is async (it involves a mutation which in test might resolve immediately if we haven't mocked it, but let's assume it does quickly).
- We did not actually mock the `createProduct` API call in this snippet. In a real test, you would want to mock network requests. One approach: use MSW (Mock Service Worker) to intercept the Axios call and return a fake response. Another approach is to spy on the `createProduct` function and return a resolved promise. For simplicity, assume it succeeds quickly.

This test covers an integration of form + react query + redux. However, for pure unit tests, you could isolate the component by mocking context or not including it. But often it's fine to include actual Redux store or a test store with needed slices for such tests (it’s fast enough if your store is small).

**Testing Library Best Practices**:

- Prefer `screen.getBy...` queries which search the rendered output, avoiding queries by test-id unless necessary. Queries like `getByLabelText` find input by its `<label>` text content, which ensures your form is accessible and the test is user-centric.
- Use `findBy...` or `waitFor` for async events (they retry until timeout).
- Use `expect(...).toBeInTheDocument()` (from jest-dom) to assert an element is present.
- Avoid testing implementation details (like internal state variables). Instead, test the visible outcome. For example, we tested the input value resets, not that `reset()` was called internally – focusing on behavior, not implementation ([React Testing Library | Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/#:~:text=,confidence%20they%20can%20give%20you)).

**Redux logic tests**: You can also unit test reducers or slices directly:

```ts
import authReducer, { loginSuccess, logout } from "./authSlice";

test("authReducer should handle loginSuccess and logout", () => {
  let state = authReducer(
    undefined,
    loginSuccess({ user: { name: "Alice" }, token: "abc123" })
  );
  expect(state.isAuthenticated).toBe(true);
  expect(state.user?.name).toBe("Alice");

  state = authReducer(state, logout());
  expect(state.isAuthenticated).toBe(false);
  expect(state.token).toBeNull();
});
```

This tests the slice reducer functions without involving React at all – it's straightforward given pure functions.

**Mocking API calls**: To make component tests deterministic, you often mock network requests. Tools like **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** integrate well with Testing Library. MSW can intercept the Axios calls our service functions make and return fake data, allowing us to simulate server responses without actually hitting a server. Setting up MSW in tests is a bit of overhead but pays off for complex interactions.

Alternatively, jest can mock modules: e.g. `jest.mock('../services/productService', () => ({ createProduct: jest.fn() }))` and then inside test define `createProduct.mockResolvedValue({ id: 123, ... })`. Then assert that `createProduct` was called with correct data on form submit. This way, you're not testing the actual API call, just that your component attempts to call it correctly.

The goal of unit tests is to verify each piece (component, function) behaves correctly in isolation. Aim to cover edge cases: e.g., validation logic (you can test that submitting with invalid data doesn’t call the API and shows errors), or that ProtectedRoute redirects appropriately.

### **Integration Testing**

Integration tests are a bit more broad – they test how different parts of the app work together. In front-end, the line between unit and integration can blur. For example, our ProductForm test is almost an integration test (component + API service integration).

Another integration test scenario: Testing route navigation and protected route behavior. We could render the whole app with MemoryRouter in a test:

```tsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "../store";
import AppRoutes from "../AppRoutes";

test("redirects to login if not authenticated", () => {
  render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <AppRoutes />
    </Provider>
  );
  window.history.pushState({}, "Test page", "/dashboard");

  expect(screen.getByText(/login/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

This assumes AppRoutes will render LoginPage if the location is /dashboard and user is not auth. We programmatically navigate to '/dashboard' and expect to see the login form. This is an integration test of the routing plus the ProtectedRoute logic.

You could also simulate a login: dispatch a login action or set up state before render, then verify `/dashboard` shows Dashboard component content.

Integration tests often involve more setup and might not need as many mocks if you use real Redux store or real components. They give confidence that the pieces interoperate correctly. Kent C. Dodds (author of Testing Library) famously suggests writing mostly integration tests, as they give more value and still run fast for front-end since everything is in-memory and synchronous except any simulated async logic ([Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration. - Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests#:~:text=Write%20tests,Integration%2C%20and%20End%20to%20End)).

### **End-to-End Testing with Cypress**

Unit and integration tests run in a simulated environment (JSDOM). **Cypress**, on the other hand, runs your application in a real browser (headless or visible) and automates interactions. E2E tests cover the entire stack: from the UI down to the API (you can choose to hit a real dev API or a mock).

Set up Cypress by adding it and maybe initializing config (`npx cypress open` creates a `cypress` folder). Write tests in `cypress/e2e` (with `.cy.ts` extension for TypeScript).

A simple Cypress test might look like:

```js
// cypress/e2e/auth.cy.ts
describe("Authentication Flow", () => {
  it("should allow a user to log in and see the dashboard", () => {
    cy.visit("http://localhost:3000/login"); // start at login page

    // Fill login form
    cy.get("input[name=email]").type("testuser@example.com");
    cy.get("input[name=password]").type("password123");
    cy.get("button[type=submit]").click();

    // After login, should redirect to dashboard
    cy.url().should("include", "/dashboard");
    cy.contains("Welcome,"); // assuming dashboard greets user
  });
});
```

This test runs the actual app. Before running, ensure the dev server (and possibly API server) is running, or use Cypress to start them via its plugins. Cypress will launch a browser, go to the login page, simulate typing and clicking, and then check that the URL changed and some expected text is present on the dashboard.

Cypress commands (`cy.get`, `cy.type`, `cy.click`) are chainable and have automatic retry. The assertions like `should('include', '/dashboard')` and `contains('Welcome')` verify expected outcomes.

You can write E2E tests for critical paths:

- Logging in, navigating to a page, creating a new item via the form, and seeing it listed.
- Trying to access an admin page as a non-admin and seeing an "unauthorized" message.
- The full register -> login -> perform action flow.

Cypress is powerful: it can simulate anything a user does in the browser. It even lets you inspect the application state or network calls if needed. However, treat it as a black box test as much as possible (interact through UI, not internal variables). It’s great for catching integration issues in a realistic environment (e.g., are our CORS settings correct so the front-end can talk to the API, does the ProtectedRoute actually protect pages when the app is built and running).

One might ask, why do E2E if we have integration tests? Because E2E tests the app as a whole in a browser, catching issues that unit tests can’t (like misconfigured routes in production, or build-time problems, or integration with real backend). They are slower than unit tests, but still valuable to run on CI for critical flows.

**Best practices for Cypress**:

- Use data-\* attributes on complex selectors (e.g., for an icon button with no text, give it `data-testid="delete-btn"` and use `cy.get('[data-testid=delete-btn]').click()`).
- Seed your database or use a test database if possible, so tests run with known data. Alternatively, use Cypress to call backend APIs or directly insert data before testing a scenario.
- Clean up after tests (or use a fresh state for each test run, which is often easiest by resetting the DB to a known state).

E2E tests can also be run against a deployed site (like staging), not only local. This helps ensure that everything works in the production build environment as well.

Cypress provides an interactive runner where you can watch the test step through, which is great for debugging. It’s developer-friendly, easy to learn, and has a lot of plugins for extra tasks ([React: Write end to end test using cypress - DEV Community](https://dev.to/clickpesa/react-write-end-to-end-test-using-cypress-3450#:~:text=Cypress%20is%20a%20great%20tool,advanced%20testing%20on%20your%20app)). It essentially covers the entire application flow in one shot, which is why it’s called end-to-end testing ([React: Write end to end test using cypress - DEV Community](https://dev.to/clickpesa/react-write-end-to-end-test-using-cypress-3450#:~:text=E,between%20different%20components%20and%20modules)).

### **Testing Summary**

Combine these testing strategies:

- Write **unit tests** for critical pure functions (utility functions, Redux reducers) and simple components (ensure a component renders correct output given props).
- Write **integration tests** for important components that involve state, context, or multiple pieces (forms, routes, etc.). These give confidence that our React Query + Axios + Redux interplay works.
- Use **Cypress E2E tests** for user stories and high-level regression (log in, navigate, do an action, expect result). Focus on the happy path and a few edge cases. E2E tests, even a handful, significantly reduce the chances of integration bugs in production because they simulate a real user on a real browser.

Remember to run tests in CI/CD pipeline. For example, run `npm test -- --coverage` for Jest to ensure coverage remains high and run Cypress in headless mode on a CI service for end-to-end.

By following these testing practices, you ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality. Tests act as a safety net, allowing confident refactoring and extension of the codebase.

## 8. **Deployment**

With our application built and tested, the final step is deployment. We want to make our React app available to users, and there are multiple ways to do so. We will discuss deploying to **Vercel** and **Netlify** (popular serverless hosting platforms for frontend apps) and using **Docker** for containerized deployment.

### **Deploying to Vercel**

**Vercel** is a seamless platform for deploying frontend applications. It offers a globally distributed CDN and automatic CI/CD for projects connected to Git. To deploy:

1. **Build the app for production**: Run `npm run build`. This creates an optimized `build/` directory with static files.
2. **Sign up on Vercel** and link your Git repository. Vercel will detect it's a React app (especially if it’s a CRA or Vite project) and set up appropriate build settings ([How to Deploy a React Site with Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-react-with-vercel#:~:text=Vercel%20CLI)).
3. Every git push can trigger a deployment. Vercel provides preview URLs for each commit on branches and production URL for the main branch.

If you prefer not to use Git integration, you can use Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

This will prompt for project settings and deploy the current directory. Vercel automatically detects React and runs the build, no config needed ([How to Deploy a React Site with Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-react-with-vercel#:~:text=1,template.vercel.app)).

Vercel is known for **zero configuration** deployments and supports features like environment variables (you can set them in the Vercel dashboard), custom domains, and serverless functions if needed. It’s highly optimized for React frameworks and static sites, meaning our app will be served from Vercel's edge network quickly around the world ([How to Deploy a React Site with Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-react-with-vercel#:~:text=Deploy%20React%20to%20Vercel)).

One thing to configure: since our app is a single-page app with client-side routing, we need to ensure all routes serve the index.html (so that React Router can handle routing). On Vercel, this is usually handled automatically for SPAs (it does a fallback to index.html for unknown routes). If needed, you can add a vercel.json config with a rewrites rule, but for CRA/Vite, it's typically not required.

### **Deploying to Netlify**

**Netlify** is another excellent platform for frontend deployments, similar to Vercel. Steps:

1. Build the app (`npm run build`).
2. Drag and drop the `build/` folder into Netlify’s web UI **OR** use Netlify’s Git integration: log in to Netlify, create a new site from Git, select your repo, and it will detect React and set build command (`npm run build`) and publish directory (`build`).
3. Netlify will deploy and give you a URL like `yourapp.netlify.app`. You can set a custom domain easily.

Netlify also automatically handles SPAs with its default configuration. If you find direct URL navigation doesn't work (404s), you might need a `_redirects` file with a catch-all: `/* /index.html 200`. But usually, Netlify’s detection for React app includes that rule.

Netlify CLI allows manual deploys as well, e.g., `netlify deploy` to deploy a draft and `netlify deploy --prod` for production.

Netlify provides environment variable configuration in its UI, continuous deployment on git push, and other features like serverless functions and form handling if needed. The big advantage is the simplicity: you can get a React app live in "less than 30 seconds" — push to GitHub and let Netlify handle it ([Losing my mind trying to deploy a simple app : r/react - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/react/comments/12mma0f/losing_my_mind_trying_to_deploy_a_simple_app/#:~:text=Netlify,on%20netlify%20and%20thats%20it)). Even without Git, the drag-and-drop of the build folder is a quick way to publish a demo or test version ([Losing my mind trying to deploy a simple app : r/react - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/react/comments/12mma0f/losing_my_mind_trying_to_deploy_a_simple_app/#:~:text=Losing%20my%20mind%20trying%20to,on%20netlify%20and%20thats%20it)).

### **Dockerizing the React App**

For teams that prefer containerization or need to deploy to container-centric platforms (like AWS ECS, Kubernetes, etc.), creating a Docker image of the app is a good approach. The React app itself is static (after build, it's just HTML, JS, CSS), so we typically use a web server (like Nginx or Caddy) to serve those files.

Use a **multi-stage Dockerfile** to optimize the image size and separate build environment from runtime ([How to Dockerize a React App: A Step-by-Step Guide for Developers | Docker](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-dockerize-react-app/#:~:text=When%20preparing%20your%20React%20app,dependencies%20from%20sneaking%20into%20production)):

```
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production image
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
# Copy a custom nginx config if needed (to handle routing)
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Explanation:

- The first stage uses Node.js to install deps and build the project. We copy only package files first and do `npm ci` to leverage caching (Docker will cache this layer if deps unchanged) ([How to Dockerize a React App: A Step-by-Step Guide for Developers | Docker](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-dockerize-react-app/#:~:text=,experience%20inside%20Docker)). Then copy the rest and run the build, producing the `build` folder.
- The second stage starts from a small Nginx image. It copies the build output into Nginx’s web root. We expose port 80 and start Nginx in foreground.

This results in a small final image (just Nginx + static files, no Node.js or dev dependencies) ([How to Dockerize a React App: A Step-by-Step Guide for Developers | Docker](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-dockerize-react-app/#:~:text=,things%20clean%2C%20secure%2C%20and%20efficient)). We separated build and runtime to ensure we only ship what’s necessary for serving the app, which improves security and performance (smaller image) ([How to Dockerize a React App: A Step-by-Step Guide for Developers | Docker](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-dockerize-react-app/#:~:text=When%20preparing%20your%20React%20app,dependencies%20from%20sneaking%20into%20production)).

Build the image with:

```bash
docker build -t my-react-app:latest .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 my-react-app:latest
```

This will serve the app on http://localhost (you can test it).

If your API is hosted elsewhere, ensure any necessary CORS settings are configured on the API, since our app will likely be served from a different origin in production.

**Routing with Nginx**: One thing with SPAs is to configure Nginx to redirect all 404s to `index.html`. In the Dockerfile above, we mention copying a custom nginx.conf. That file could contain:

```
location / {
  try_files $uri /index.html =404;
}
```

This tells Nginx to try to serve the requested file; if it doesn't exist (i.e., it's a client-side route like "/dashboard"), serve index.html instead, and only return 404 if index.html isn’t found (which would mean truly not found). This way, refreshing on a client route works. Include this config in the image as shown (copy to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`).

Now, with a Docker image, you can deploy to any container platform. This could be a Kubernetes cluster, AWS ECS/Fargate, Google Cloud Run, or even a VM with Docker installed. The environment is consistent (the container bundles Nginx and the app), eliminating the "works on my machine" problem, as the container environment is the same everywhere ([How to Dockerize a React App: A Step-by-Step Guide for Developers | Docker](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-dockerize-react-app/#:~:text=You%20might%20be%20wondering%2C%20%E2%80%9CWhy,and%20deployment%20game%2C%20such%20as)) ([How to Dockerize a React App: A Step-by-Step Guide for Developers | Docker](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-dockerize-react-app/#:~:text=,resources%20in%20a%20production%20environment)).

**Comparison**: Using Vercel/Netlify vs Docker:

- Vercel/Netlify are easier, especially for pure front-end. They handle scaling, CDN, SSL, etc., automatically. Great for most use cases.
- Docker gives more control and is useful if your deployment target is container-centric or if you want to unify how front-end and back-end are deployed (e.g., both as containers in a docker-compose or k8s).
- You can also deploy Docker image to services like **Heroku** or **Azure Web App** or **Google Cloud Run** which will run the container for you. Or use **Docker Compose** to run the frontend and maybe a Node/Express backend together for easy development or deployment.

Regardless of method, ensure to set environment variables for API URLs in production. For Netlify/Vercel, define them in the dashboard (they will be used at build time unless your app reads them at runtime). For Docker, you might bake the API URL into the build (not ideal if it varies) or better, have the frontend dynamically determine it (some use environment files that are fetched at runtime or use placeholders that you replace during container start).

Finally, after deployment, test the production app:

- Verify routes work (especially deep links).
- Check that API calls succeed (you might need to configure CORS on the API to allow the domain of your deployed app).
- Set up monitoring or analytics if needed (Vercel offers analytics, or use Google Analytics, etc., depending on requirements).

Our React app is now deployed! Whether we chose Vercel (“zero-config” deployment ([How to Deploy a React Site with Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-react-with-vercel#:~:text=Deploy%20React%20to%20Vercel))), Netlify (very fast and dev-friendly ([Losing my mind trying to deploy a simple app : r/react - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/react/comments/12mma0f/losing_my_mind_trying_to_deploy_a_simple_app/#:~:text=Netlify,on%20netlify%20and%20thats%20it))), or Docker (flexible and portable), the result is a live application accessible to users.

## 9. **Code Optimization & Best Practices**

To ensure our application remains performant and maintainable, we should follow optimization techniques and coding best practices. This final section covers performance tuning (like lazy loading and memoization) and general standards for clean, robust code.

### **Performance Optimization Techniques**

**Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**: We’ve touched on using React.lazy for lazy loading components not needed on initial render. For example, route-based splitting: import heavy page components with `React.lazy()`. This reduces initial bundle size and improves load time, especially for large apps ([ReactJS Performance Optimization: Best Practices - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sarthakc20/reactjs-performance-optimization-best-practices-jjn#:~:text=How%20This%20Helps)) ([ReactJS Performance Optimization: Best Practices - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sarthakc20/reactjs-performance-optimization-best-practices-jjn#:~:text=1,loaded%20when%20they%20are%20needed)). Always provide a fallback (like a spinner) via Suspense for a good UX. By deferring loading of non-critical code, users see the main interface faster, and secondary chunks load when needed, improving perceived performance ([ReactJS Performance Optimization: Best Practices - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sarthakc20/reactjs-performance-optimization-best-practices-jjn#:~:text=2,making%20the%20app%20more%20responsive)) ([ReactJS Performance Optimization: Best Practices - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sarthakc20/reactjs-performance-optimization-best-practices-jjn#:~:text=By%20implementing%20lazy%20loading%2C%20we,friendly)).

**Memoization**:

- Use `React.memo` on functional components that accept props but do not always need to re-render when parent does. For instance, a `<UserList>` that re-renders only if the list of users changes can be wrapped in `export default React.memo(UserList)`. This prevents needless re-renders.
- `useMemo` hook is used to memoize expensive computations or to avoid re-creating objects on each render. For example, if you have a component that performs a heavy calculation based on props, wrap that calculation in `useMemo(() => heavyCalc(props.data), [props.data])`. This caches the result unless `props.data` changes ([ReactJS Performance Optimization: Best Practices - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sarthakc20/reactjs-performance-optimization-best-practices-jjn#:~:text=,render%20unless%20the%20dependencies%20change)). This is like the "sticky note" for results analogy ([ReactJS Performance Optimization: Best Practices - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sarthakc20/reactjs-performance-optimization-best-practices-jjn#:~:text=Imagine%20you%20are%20a%20student,lot%20of%20time%20and%20effort)) ([ReactJS Performance Optimization: Best Practices - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sarthakc20/reactjs-performance-optimization-best-practices-jjn#:~:text=What%20is%20)) – it saves recomputation time.
- `useCallback` memoizes functions, useful when passing callbacks to child components (to prevent child re-renders when the parent re-renders). Only use it when necessary – e.g., if the child is expensive to render or is memoized itself and relies on stable prop references.
- **Caveat**: Don't overuse useMemo/useCallback. They themselves introduce some memory and computation overhead to track dependencies. Use them when a component is re-rendering frequently with unchanged expensive computations, or when referential stability is needed to prevent downstream effects (like triggering effect dependencies or re-rendering pure children). The React docs note that you should not use useMemo to fix code that is functionally incorrect without it; use it purely as an optimization ([useMemo - React](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo#:~:text=useMemo%20,Then%20you%20may)) ([useMemo - React](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo#:~:text=doesn%27t%20work%20without%20it%2C%20find,Then%20you%20may)).

**Avoid expensive operations in render**: If you have complex loops or calculations, do them outside the component or inside useMemo. For example, computing a large filtered list for display – useMemo to only do it when input data changes.

**Optimize re-renders**:

- Keep state as minimal as possible. If you have a huge object in state but only one property changes, consider splitting state so that only relevant parts cause re-render.
- In lists, make sure to give stable `key` props to list items. This helps React re-use DOM elements instead of re-rendering entire lists on minor changes.
- If you notice a performance issue, use React DevTools Profiler to pinpoint slow components and then apply memoization or splitting as needed.

**Virtualize long lists**: If you need to display hundreds or thousands of items, use a library like **react-window** or **react-virtualized** to render only the visible portion of the list. This dramatically reduces DOM node count and improves scroll performance for large data sets.

**Throttling/debouncing**: For events like window resize or high-frequency events, use lodash.throttle or debounce (or useRequestAnimationFrame for smooth handling) to avoid flooding the app with too many updates.

**Web Vitals**: Keep an eye on metrics like bundle size, first contentful paint, etc. We already mitigate bundle size by lazy loading. Using performance analysis tools (Webpack Bundle Analyzer or Source Map Explorer for CRA) can show if any dependency is too large and if we can trim it.

### **Code Quality Best Practices**

**TypeScript Best Practices**:

- **Avoid `any`** whenever possible. Leverage TS to catch errors. If you find yourself using `any`, consider if you can define a proper type or use unknown and then type guard. Using `strict` mode helps catch implicit anys and other issues ([React with TypeScript: Best Practices — SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-with-typescript-best-practices/#:~:text=developer%20productivity%20by%20catching%20errors,consistency%2C%20especially%20in%20team%20environments)).
- Use interfaces or type aliases for object shapes (e.g., `type User = { id: number; name: string; role: string }`). This makes code self-documenting and helps IDEs provide autocompletion.
- Make use of utility types (Partial, Required, Pick, Omit) for manipulating types instead of duplicating similar types.
- Keep your types in dedicated files or modules (`types/` folder as we structured) to avoid import cycles. It also separates data definitions from logic.
- Use generics in functions or hooks to maintain type safety. For example, if creating a custom hook to fetch data, you can have it generic `useFetch<T>` that returns `T` typed data.

**Clean Code Principles**:

- **SOLID** where applicable in React: e.g., Single Responsibility – ensure each component does one thing (a presentational component vs a container component). Segregate logic into hooks or utility functions instead of giant components.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: If you notice similar code in multiple places, consider refactoring into a reusable component or function. For example, if you have two forms that share a lot, perhaps create a generic form component or a custom hook that both use.
- **Consistent Naming**: Follow a convention for naming files (some use kebab-case for files, PascalCase for component files, etc. – our structure likely uses PascalCase for component filenames like `ProductForm.tsx`). Name state variables clearly (e.g., `isLoading` for booleans), and action creators as verb phrases (loginSuccess, fetchUsers, etc.).
- **Comments and Documentation**: Code should be mostly self-explanatory with good naming, but for complex sections, add comments. JSDoc comment blocks can be added to functions or complex logic for clarity. For larger projects, maintain a `README.md` or documentation site describing the architecture (especially for other developers).
- **ESLint**: Respect the linter; it often encodes many best practices (like no unused vars, dependency array completeness in useEffect, etc.). Adjust or extend rules as necessary for your context, but generally the recommended rules help avoid common bugs.
- **Prettier**: Keep code formatted. This reduces diff noise in PRs and makes it easier to scan code. It's already integrated in our setup.

**Security**:

- Never expose sensitive info in the front-end code. Our app might need an API key for something; if so, keep it in an environment variable and do not commit it. Remember that any keys in front-end (even in env variables at build time) end up visible to users (because React code runs on client). So rely on backend for truly secret keys (like database credentials, etc.).
- Use HTTPS in production for all API calls to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. If using Netlify or Vercel, they automatically provide HTTPS on their domain. If self-hosting via Docker on a VM, use a proxy or load balancer to terminate SSL, or use a Let's Encrypt setup with Nginx.
- Enable appropriate security headers. Netlify and Vercel handle some, but if using Nginx you might add headers for content security policy, XSS protection, etc., based on your needs.

**Performance (continued)**:

- We should mention that using production build (minified, optimized) is important. React in development mode is much slower and emits warnings; always deploy the production build (`npm run build` output). This we implicitly did by deploying static files.
- Monitor runtime performance: use Chrome DevTools performance tab or Lighthouse to see if any bottlenecks exist (like a slow component or large chunk).

**Maintaining Standards**:

- Use GitHub (or GitLab) Pull Requests and code reviews. Automated tools can run ESLint and tests on each PR (using GitHub Actions or similar). Possibly integrate Prettier as a pre-commit hook (using Husky) to ensure every commit is formatted.
- Keep dependencies updated: Outdated packages can have security vulnerabilities or performance issues. But also be cautious with major upgrades (run tests after upgrading).
- Write tests for new features (to keep coverage up and catch regressions).
- Refactor mercilessly when code smells appear (e.g., if a file becomes too large or a function does too many things, break it down).

By following these practices, the codebase will remain healthy and easier to work with over time. Optimizations like lazy loading and memoization will ensure the app stays fast even as it grows, and coding standards will make it easier for multiple developers to collaborate without tripping over style issues or avoidable bugs.

**Conclusion**: We have covered a wide range of topics to integrate a MySQL-based API into a React TypeScript app with Material UI. We set up a scalable project structure and tools (ESLint, Prettier) to enforce quality. We used Redux Toolkit and React Query to elegantly handle state and async data. We created forms using React Hook Form and Yup to simplify validation. We implemented authentication with JWT and protected routes for security. We customized Material UI’s theme, including a dark mode switch, to create a polished UI consistent with our brand. We wrote tests at multiple levels to ensure reliability, and we discussed deploying the app to modern hosting platforms or via Docker. Finally, we addressed performance tuning and best coding practices so the app remains efficient and maintainable. Following this guide, an advanced developer should be able to integrate all these pieces and build a robust, full-featured front-end application ready for production. Happy coding!
