## Introduction & System Overview

In this chapter, we introduce the **Deals Management System** and outline its high-level functionality and requirements. We will define what problems it solves and the key features it will include. This sets the context for the architectural and technical decisions in later sections.

**What is a Deals Management System?**  
A Deals Management System is a web application that allows organizations to create, manage, and track “deals” – for example, sales deals, discount offers, or business agreements. It typically involves managing data like deal details, participants (customers or partners), statuses, deadlines, and financial information. For our scenario, we assume it’s a system to manage sales deals in an organization, where users can create deals, update their status, and collaborate on them. The system might also handle promotional deals or coupons distributed to customers, depending on the business context.

**Key Features and Requirements:**

- **Deal Creation & Editing:** Users (with proper permissions) can create new deals, specifying details such as title, description, value, client, deadlines, etc. They can edit deal information as it progresses.
- **Deal Tracking:** Each deal has a status (e.g., _New_, _In Progress_, _Won_, _Lost_). The system tracks changes in status and allows filtering or reporting based on status and date.
- **User Roles:** Role-based access control is required. For instance, _Sales Representatives_ can create and update their deals, _Managers_ can see all deals and approve high-value deals, and _Admins_ manage users and system settings.
- **Collaboration:** Notes or comments can be added to deals, enabling collaboration. Notifications (real-time or via email) are sent when important changes occur (like a deal being closed).
- **Search & Reporting:** Advanced search filters for deals (by client, date range, status, etc.), and summary reports (e.g. total value of deals in pipeline).
- **Performance & Scale:** The system should handle a growing number of deals and concurrent users. This implies writing efficient code and possibly scaling horizontally (multiple server instances) when needed.

**Technology Choices:**

- **Frontend:** React.js for a dynamic, responsive single-page application (SPA) with a modern user experience. React will allow us to create reusable UI components and manage client-side state effectively.
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java) to implement a robust RESTful API. Spring Boot simplifies configuration and follows the production-ready principles, with built-in support for security (Spring Security), JPA for database access, and easy REST endpoint creation.
- **Database:** MySQL as the relational database to store persistent data about deals, users, and related entities. MySQL is reliable for transactional data and works well with Spring Data JPA.
- **Communication:** The React frontend communicates with the Spring Boot backend via RESTful HTTP APIs (JSON payloads). We will use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing these API calls.
- **Deployment:** We plan to use Docker for containerizing the application, and consider cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for hosting. CI/CD pipelines will automate testing and deployment for rapid iteration.

**Development Approach:**  
The guide will follow a **layered approach**: we’ll build the backend API first (with proper design and testing), then develop the frontend that consumes those APIs. We’ll integrate security in the middle of backend development (to secure endpoints and manage user identities). Throughout, we’ll apply **best practices** and optimize for performance and maintainability. Testing will be performed at each layer (unit tests for backend logic, component tests for frontend, and integration tests for the end-to-end flow).

By the end of this guide, you will have a well-structured, scalable Deals Management System and a deep understanding of how to integrate React, Spring Boot, and MySQL effectively in a production-grade application.

## Advanced Architecture & Design Principles

Designing an advanced system requires careful planning of the architecture and adherence to sound design principles. In this chapter, we discuss the system’s architecture, including how we structure the application, enforce separation of concerns, and apply design patterns to achieve a scalable and maintainable codebase.

### System Architecture Overview

**Monolithic vs Microservices:** For this guide, we will implement a **monolithic** application (the entire backend as one deployable unit) for simplicity. However, we will structure the code in a modular way, so it could be broken into microservices in the future if needed. A deals management system could be segmented (e.g., separate services for deals, users, notifications), but starting monolithic is simpler and then scaling out if needed is possible with Spring Boot’s modular nature.

**Client-Server Separation:** The frontend (React) is a separate client application that communicates with the backend (Spring Boot) via REST API calls. This separation adheres to a clear client-server model: the React app is served to users’ browsers and then issues AJAX (HTTP) calls to the Spring Boot server for data and actions.

**Layered Architecture:** We will use a **layered architecture** pattern in the backend:

- **Controller Layer:** REST controllers that handle HTTP requests, parse inputs, and return HTTP responses (typically JSON). Controllers call services for business logic.
- **Service Layer:** Contains business logic and coordinates between controllers and repositories. It applies rules (e.g., “a user with role Manager can approve a deal”) and orchestrates transactions.
- **Repository (Data Access) Layer:** Manages interaction with the database using Spring Data JPA repositories. This layer is responsible for retrieving and storing data (entities).
- **Model Layer:** The domain models or entities representing our data (Deal, User, etc.), typically mapped to database tables via JPA annotations.

This traditional layered approach enforces separation of concerns, making the code more organized and maintainable ([Spring Boot: Best Practices for Scalable Applications](https://www.codewalnut.com/insights/spring-boot-best-practices-for-scalable-applications#:~:text=1,organized%20and%20easier%20to%20maintain)). Each layer has a clear responsibility, and we can change one layer’s implementation with minimal impact on others (for example, swapping the database or the web framework if needed).

> **Layered Architecture:** A well-structured Spring Boot project separates components into layers (controller, service, repository, model), ensuring clear separation of concerns. Each layer has a specific responsibility, making the codebase organized and easier to maintain ([Spring Boot: Best Practices for Scalable Applications](https://www.codewalnut.com/insights/spring-boot-best-practices-for-scalable-applications#:~:text=1,organized%20and%20easier%20to%20maintain)).

**Alternative Architecture Patterns:** For advanced needs, one might consider:

- **Feature-Based Packaging:** Instead of grouping by layer, grouping by feature (all code for “Deals” in one package, “Users” in another, etc.). This can improve modularity for larger projects.
- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters):** Separates core business logic from external components (like DB, web). This can make the core logic more isolated and easier to test, allowing swapping out data sources or UI without affecting core code ([Spring Boot: Best Practices for Scalable Applications](https://www.codewalnut.com/insights/spring-boot-best-practices-for-scalable-applications#:~:text=3,without%20affecting%20the%20core%20logic)).
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** If the domain (business logic around deals) is complex, using DDD principles helps align the software design closely with business terms. For example, concepts like _Aggregate_ (a Deal as the aggregate root containing related objects), _Value Objects_ (e.g., a MonetaryAmount type for deal value), and _Domain Services_. In our case, we’ll keep it simpler but still use some DDD-inspired clarity in modeling (like clearly delineating the Deal entity and its invariants).

### Domain Modeling

Before coding, it’s crucial to outline the main entities and relationships in the system:

- **User:** Represents a system user. Key fields: id, name, email, password (hashed), role (e.g., ROLE_USER, ROLE_MANAGER, ROLE_ADMIN). A user can create or update deals. We’ll have different roles to enforce permissions.
- **Deal:** Represents a sales or promotional deal. Fields: id, title, description, value (monetary amount), status, createdDate, modifiedDate, owner (the User who created it or is responsible), maybe a list of notes or history.
- **Note/Comment:** (Optional) If we allow collaboration, deals can have comments. Fields: id, dealId (link to Deal), author (User), content, timestamp.
- **Other related entities:** If needed, a _Client_ entity (the customer for the deal) or _Product_ entity (if deals are attached to products). For simplicity, we might just store client name or product info as part of deal for now.

We will design the **database schema** reflecting these entities (see next chapter). In our design:

- A **User** can have many **Deal**s (one-to-many relationship: one owner user -> many deals).
- A **Deal** may have many **Note**s (one-to-many: a deal -> comments).
- We’ll also have a relationship for deals and users in context of assignments: e.g., a Deal has an owner (Many deals to one user). We might also track who last updated or created the deal.
- If implementing approvers or watchers on a deal, we might have a many-to-many relationship (not in initial scope, but something to consider if expanding).

### Design Principles and Best Practices

To ensure our system is robust and maintainable, we apply the following design principles:

- **Separation of Concerns:** As mentioned, each layer and each component has a focused responsibility. The frontend handles presentation and user interaction, the backend handles business logic and data, and each piece of the backend (controllers vs services vs repositories) has a distinct role.
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):** We will create reusable components and utilities. For example, a generic Response wrapper for API results, a centralized error handling mechanism on the backend, common UI components on the frontend, etc., to avoid duplicate code.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Design for clarity. We favor simple solutions (e.g., straightforward REST endpoints and queries) unless a more complex approach is clearly justified. For instance, we won’t prematurely introduce things like message queues or complex multi-threading until needed for scaling.
- **Secure by Design:** We incorporate security from the start. Using Spring Security to handle authentication and authorization will be planned in the architecture (not an afterthought). We’ll design with the principle of least privilege (each user only gets access to what they need) ([Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Spring Boot](https://basicutils.com/learn/spring-security/implementing-role-based-access-control-rbac-spring-boot#:~:text=Role,without%20affecting%20user%20permissions%20directly)) and ensure sensitive data (like passwords or tokens) is handled properly.
- **Scalability & Flexibility:** The architecture should handle increased load. Using Spring Boot with stateless JWT authentication means we can run multiple instances behind a load balancer easily. We design our components statelessly where possible (especially the web tier) to aid horizontal scaling.
- **Modularity:** Even within a monolith, keep modules loosely coupled. For example, the code managing deals should not depend on code managing, say, notifications except through well-defined interfaces or events. This makes future expansion (like pulling notifications into its own service) easier.

Finally, we will keep in mind **performance optimization** opportunities (caching, efficient queries) as part of the design, which we’ll detail in the relevant sections. With a solid architecture in place, we can confidently proceed to setting up our development environment and starting implementation.

## Setting Up Development Environment

A productive development environment is critical for efficient coding and testing. In this chapter, we’ll set up all necessary tools and frameworks required for our Deals Management System. This includes containerization tools, IDEs, API testing tools, and database management tools.

### Docker

**Why Docker:** We’ll use Docker to containerize our application and its dependencies, which ensures consistency across different environments (development, testing, production). Docker allows us to package the Spring Boot app (and possibly the React app and MySQL database) into lightweight containers. We can also use Docker Compose for orchestrating multiple containers (e.g., running the Spring Boot app, a MySQL database, and perhaps a separate Nginx for static frontend).

**Installation:** Install Docker Desktop if you are on Windows or Mac. For Linux, install the Docker Engine and docker-compose. Verify the installation by running `docker --version` in a terminal. Ensure Docker Compose is installed (`docker compose version` for the latest Docker, or `docker-compose --version` for older setups).

**Using Docker in Development:** While coding, you can run a MySQL database in a Docker container to avoid installing it locally:

```bash
docker run -d --name deals-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
           -e MYSQL_DATABASE=deals_db -p 3306:3306 mysql:8.0
```

This command pulls MySQL 8.0 image, starts a container with a root password and creates a database named `deals_db`, exposing it on port 3306. We will connect our Spring Boot application to this database.

We’ll also prepare a **Dockerfile** for our Spring Boot app later, so we can containerize the backend. Similarly, for the React app, we can either containerize it (e.g., using a Node image to build, and an Nginx image to serve static files) or simply deploy it as static files on a cloud storage. We will cover deployment details in the Deploying section.

For now, ensure Docker is up and running, and test running a simple container (like the hello-world image) to confirm your environment is ready.

### IDEs and Editors (VS Code, IntelliJ)

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** VS Code is a versatile editor we can use for the frontend (and even backend). We recommend it for editing the React project. Install VS Code from its official website. Key extensions to consider:

- _ESLint:_ for JavaScript/TypeScript linting.
- _Prettier:_ for code formatting.
- _Java Extension Pack:_ if you want to edit Java code in VS Code (though IntelliJ is more feature-rich for Java).

After installing, configure VS Code settings to your preference, such as format on save, tab spaces, etc., to keep your code style consistent.

**IntelliJ IDEA:** IntelliJ (Community Edition is fine for our purposes) is an excellent IDE for Java and Spring Boot development. Download and install IntelliJ IDEA. It provides powerful support for Spring Boot projects:

- It can directly import a Maven or Gradle project and understand Spring Boot’s structure.
- Features like auto-completion of annotations and properties, running Spring Boot apps with a click, and integrated debugging/testing tools make development smoother.

We will use IntelliJ for the backend development. Once installed:

- Install the **“Spring Boot”** and **“Spring Assistant”** plugins if not already present (usually IntelliJ community has basic Spring support, Ultimate has advanced support).
- Also consider installing the **Lombok** plugin (if we use Lombok for boilerplate reduction in Java).
- Ensure JDK is configured in IntelliJ (we’ll use JDK 17 or above for Spring Boot 3+).

**Project Organization in IDEs:**  
We will have two separate projects:

- The Spring Boot project (a Maven/Gradle project) – open this in IntelliJ.
- The React project (a Node.js project) – open this in VS Code.

This separation is logical since they are different tech stacks. Communication between them is via HTTP, not via shared project files.

### API Testing Tools (Postman)

**Postman:** Postman is a popular tool for testing APIs. We’ll use Postman to manually test our REST endpoints during development and debugging. Install Postman (it's available as a standalone app).

In Postman, we can create a “Deals Management API” collection and save requests for login, creating a deal, fetching deals, etc. This will be helpful for quickly re-testing endpoints as we develop them.

Key Postman features to utilize:

- **Collections:** Organize your requests (we’ll have folders for “Auth”, “Deals”, “Users” etc.).
- **Environment Variables:** We can set up an environment (e.g., “Localhost Dev”) with variables like `base_url = http://localhost:8080/api` and `auth_token` for the JWT. This allows easy switching if the server URL changes or when deploying.
- **Testing & Scripts:** For advanced usage, Postman allows writing test scripts (in JavaScript) to automate checking responses. For example, after a login request, automatically extract the JWT token and store it in an environment variable for subsequent requests.

We will also mention later how Postman can be used for automated integration tests or how to incorporate those tests in CI/CD (via Newman, the Postman CLI runner).

For now, ensure Postman is installed and you know the basics of sending a GET/POST request and examining the response JSON. We’ll provide example Postman configurations when testing the backend API.

### Database Workbench (MySQL Workbench)

**MySQL Workbench:** This is a GUI client for MySQL that helps in visualizing the database, running SQL queries, and designing schemas. Download and install MySQL Workbench from the MySQL website.

Use MySQL Workbench to:

- Connect to our local MySQL database (for example, the Dockerized one running on `localhost:3306`).
- Run test queries or inspect tables (very useful to verify if data is being saved correctly by the application).
- Design our schema: MySQL Workbench has an EER diagram tool. We can sketch the deals, users, and notes tables and their relationships. However, since we’ll use JPA (which can auto-generate tables), we might not manually create the schema with SQL. Still, understanding the schema via Workbench is helpful.

**Setting up Connection:** Open Workbench and create a new connection:

- Host: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `3306`
- Username: `root` (or whatever user we set)
- Password: `secret` (as used in the Docker run command above)
- Default Schema: `deals_db` (the database name we created)

Test the connection. Once connected, initially, you might see no tables in `deals_db` (since we haven’t run the app yet). Later, when Spring Boot runs with JPA, it will create tables (assuming we configure `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` to `update` or similar). We can then refresh the schema in Workbench to see those tables and columns.

**Alternative Tools:** If you prefer the command-line, the `mysql` CLI or tools like **TablePlus**, **DBeaver**, or **HeidiSQL** can also be used for MySQL database access. Any tool that lets you inspect tables and run queries will do.

### Node & NPM/Yarn

While not explicitly listed, ensure you have **Node.js** installed (preferably the LTS version). Node.js is required to create and run the React development server and build the production bundle. The default package manager that comes with Node.js is **npm**, and many developers also use **yarn** or **pnpm** as alternatives. In this guide, we’ll assume npm (or yarn) usage for React:

- Check Node is installed: `node -v` and `npm -v`.
- If you prefer yarn, install it (`npm install -g yarn`) and check `yarn -v`.

The React project setup (covered in a later chapter) will involve using a tool like `create-react-app` or similar, which uses Node and npm.

With the development tools set up (Docker, IDEs, Postman, Workbench, Node), we are ready to start building the backend of our application.

---

## Building the Backend (Spring Boot)

The backend is the core of our Deals Management System, providing a RESTful API for the frontend and handling all business logic, data management, and security. In this chapter, we will set up the Spring Boot project and progressively add functionality to it: connecting to MySQL, designing the data schema with JPA, implementing JWT authentication and role-based access control, developing the REST API endpoints for deals and users, optimizing performance, and writing tests.

### Project Setup

We will use **Spring Boot** (version 3.x latest at the time of writing) to bootstrap our backend application. Spring Boot dramatically simplifies setting up a Spring project by providing defaults and auto-configuration. We will manage the project with Maven (or Gradle if you prefer – steps are similar, but we’ll illustrate with Maven here).

**Using Spring Initializr:** The easiest way to start is to use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) ([Spring Boot: Best Practices for Scalable Applications](https://www.codewalnut.com/insights/spring-boot-best-practices-for-scalable-applications#:~:text=1,)). Spring Initializr is a web tool (and integrated in IntelliJ and VS Code extensions) that generates a project with the desired dependencies.

Go to start.spring.io and configure the project:

- Project: **Maven** (or Gradle)
- Language: **Java** (could also choose Kotlin, but we’ll stick to Java)
- Spring Boot: **3.x** (latest stable)
- Group: **com.example** (or your organization’s domain)
- Artifact: **deals-management**
- Name: **DealsManagementSystem**
- Package Name: **com.example.deals** (feel free to choose appropriate package)
- Java Version: **17** (since Spring Boot 3 requires Java 17+)
- Dependencies: add the following:
  - **Spring Web** (for REST controllers)
  - **Spring Data JPA** (for database access via Hibernate)
  - **MySQL Driver** (JDBC driver for MySQL)
  - **Spring Security** (for securing the application)
  - **Spring Boot DevTools** (optional, for hot reloading in development)
  - **Lombok** (optional, to reduce boilerplate in models)
  - We will also need a JWT library (we can add **jjwt** later manually if needed, or use Spring Security’s JWT support via OAuth2 Resource Server dependency).

> If using Spring Initializr’s UI: search for “web”, “data jpa”, “mysql”, “security”, “devtools”, “lombok” in the dependencies list and add them.

Click "Generate" to download the project zip. Unzip it, and open it in **IntelliJ IDEA**. IntelliJ will detect it's a Maven project and import dependencies.

**Project Structure:** Spring Boot projects have a common structure:

```
deals-management/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/example/deals/
│   │   │       └── DealsManagementSystemApplication.java  (the main class)
│   │   └── resources/
│   │       ├── application.properties  (configuration)
│   │       └── ... (other resources like templates if any)
│   └── test/ ... (test classes)
├── pom.xml (Maven configuration)
```

Open the `pom.xml` and verify the dependencies. If we missed any (like JSON Web Token library), we will add it. For example, to use the JJWT library, add in `<dependencies>`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>
    <artifactId>jjwt-api</artifactId>
    <version>0.11.5</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>
    <artifactId>jjwt-impl</artifactId>
    <version>0.11.5</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>
    <artifactId>jjwt-jackson</artifactId>
    <version>0.11.5</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

This adds JJWT library which we'll use for generating and validating JWT tokens (since Spring Security doesn’t provide JWT generation out-of-the-box; it focuses on validation part if using their oauth2 resource server approach).

**Running the Application:** At this point, try to run the generated app. In IntelliJ, run the `DealsManagementSystemApplication.main()` method (which contains `SpringApplication.run(...)`). It should start up and by default listen on port 8080. Since we haven’t defined any controllers yet, it won’t serve any content besides the default error page. But seeing it start without errors confirms the setup is correct.

Check the console output for a line like `Started DealsManagementSystemApplication in X seconds`. If all good, stop the app and proceed.

**Code Structure and Packages:** We will organize our code into packages by layer or feature. A common approach is:

- `com.example.deals.config` – for configuration classes (e.g., security config).
- `com.example.deals.model` – for entity classes (JPA entities for Deal, User, etc.).
- `com.example.deals.repository` – for Spring Data JPA repository interfaces.
- `com.example.deals.service` – for service classes containing business logic.
- `com.example.deals.controller` – for REST controller classes.

This structure keeps things tidy ([Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Spring Boot](https://basicutils.com/learn/spring-security/implementing-role-based-access-control-rbac-spring-boot#:~:text=src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fbasicutils%2Frbac%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20config%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20controller,repository%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20security%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20service)):

```
com.example.deals
├── config/
├── controller/
├── model/
├── repository/
├── security/   (could separate security-specific classes)
└── service/
```

_(The `security` package is optional; often we put security config under config or separate if many classes like filters.)_

> Example from an RBAC tutorial: organizing into config, controller, model, repository, security, service packages ([Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Spring Boot](https://basicutils.com/learn/spring-security/implementing-role-based-access-control-rbac-spring-boot#:~:text=src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fbasicutils%2Frbac%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20config%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20controller,repository%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20security%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20service)), which aligns with our plan.

We will create these packages as needed while coding.

### Database Schema Design (MySQL with JPA/Hibernate)

We already identified the main entities for our system (Deal, User, Note). Now we translate those into a database schema. We’ll use **JPA (Java Persistence API)** with Hibernate (the default JPA implementation used by Spring Boot) to map Java classes to database tables. This means we will define Java entities and let JPA generate the schema (or validate it) in the MySQL database.

**Database Configuration:** Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `.yml` if you prefer YAML). We need to set up the database connection properties:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/deals_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=secret
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

Explanation:

- The `url` points to our MySQL instance (change host/port/db as needed; here using localhost and the `deals_db` we created).
- Username/password as configured (never hardcode real passwords in production – for dev it’s okay, but we’ll discuss secure config later).
- `ddl-auto=update` tells Hibernate to auto-create/alter tables to match entities. In development this is convenient. In production, you might use `validate` or manage schema via migrations, but for this guide we use `update` to auto-sync.
- `show-sql=true` will print SQL statements in the console, helpful for debugging and understanding what JPA is doing.

Now let’s define our **Entity classes**:

**User Entity (`User.java`):**

```java
package com.example.deals.model;

import jakarta.persistence.*;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {

    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(nullable=false, unique=true)
    private String email;

    @Column(nullable=false)
    private String password; // stored as hash

    @Column(nullable=false)
    private String name;

    @ElementCollection(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @CollectionTable(name="user_roles", joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="user_id"))
    @Column(name="role")
    private Set<String> roles = new HashSet<>();

    // Constructors, getters, setters omitted for brevity
}
```

Here we create a `users` table with fields id, email, password, name. We also manage roles: for simplicity, using a Set of strings (like "ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN"). This uses an ElementCollection, which means a separate table `user_roles` that maps user IDs to roles. Alternatively, we could create a Role entity and a many-to-many relationship, but a collection of strings is straightforward and fine if roles are just predefined constants.

**Deal Entity (`Deal.java`):**

```java
package com.example.deals.model;

import jakarta.persistence.*;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Entity
@Table(name = "deals")
public class Deal {

    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(nullable=false)
    private String title;

    private String description;

    @Column(nullable=false)
    private Double value;  // could use BigDecimal for currency

    @Column(nullable=false)
    private String status; // e.g., "NEW", "IN_PROGRESS", "WON", "LOST"

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="owner_id", nullable=false)
    private User owner;  // the user who owns this deal

    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt;

    // Constructors, getters, setters...
}
```

The `Deal` is linked to `User` via a many-to-one (many deals to one user). JPA will create a foreign key `owner_id` referencing `users.id`. We store status as a string for simplicity (could be an enum in Java, persisted as string). We have timestamps for creation and update; we will manage these in the service or via JPA callbacks (like `@PrePersist` and `@PreUpdate` annotations to set them automatically).

**Note Entity (`DealNote.java`):** (if implementing comments)

```java
package com.example.deals.model;

import jakarta.persistence.*;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Entity
@Table(name="deal_notes")
public class DealNote {

    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne @JoinColumn(name="deal_id", nullable=false)
    private Deal deal;

    @ManyToOne @JoinColumn(name="author_id", nullable=false)
    private User author;

    @Column(nullable=false)
    private String content;

    @Column(nullable=false)
    private LocalDateTime timestamp;

    // ...
}
```

This entity holds a note content, links to a deal and an author. For now, we may or may not implement full note functionality in the API, but this shows how it could be done.

Once these entities are defined, on application startup, Hibernate (via `ddl-auto=update`) will create the tables: users, user_roles, deals, deal_notes with appropriate columns and foreign keys.

**Repository Interfaces:** Using Spring Data JPA, we create repository interfaces for each aggregate:

- `UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long>`
- `DealRepository extends JpaRepository<Deal, Long>`
- `DealNoteRepository extends JpaRepository<DealNote, Long>`

For example:

```java
package com.example.deals.repository;

import com.example.deals.model.Deal;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;
import java.util.List;

public interface DealRepository extends JpaRepository<Deal, Long> {
    List<Deal> findByOwnerId(Long ownerId);
    List<Deal> findByStatus(String status);

    @Query("SELECT d FROM Deal d WHERE d.value > ?1")
    List<Deal> findHighValueDeals(Double minValue);
}
```

This repository inherits CRUD methods (save, findById, findAll, delete, etc.). We add a couple of query methods:

- `findByOwnerId` – Spring Data JPA will parse this and generate the query to find deals by owner’s ID.
- `findByStatus` – find deals matching a status.
- A custom JPQL query example `findHighValueDeals` using `@Query`.

Similar repository for User:

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    Optional<User> findByEmail(String email);
}
```

We will often need to find a user by email (for login). Optional is used to handle not found.

**Database Constraints:** We have set some with annotations (unique email, not null fields). These become SQL constraints. Additionally, we might want an index on `status` or `owner_id` for performance since we’ll query by those; JPA can create indexes via `@Table(indexes = {...})` annotation, or we can add in the schema. For simplicity, we skip explicit index creation here, but know that for large data it's beneficial (e.g., index on deals.status if querying lots by status, index on deals.owner_id).

**Data initialization:** For development, it’s useful to have some initial data. We can use Spring Boot’s data SQL import feature or a Java initializer. A quick way: create `data.sql` in `src/main/resources` with some INSERT statements. For instance:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, email, password, name) VALUES (1, 'admin@example.com', '...hashedpass...', 'Admin User');
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) VALUES (1, 'ROLE_ADMIN');
```

However, if `ddl-auto=update`, inserting with a fixed id might conflict if sequence starts at 1. Alternatively, use `schema.sql` for DDL and `data.sql` for data, or better, a CommandLineRunner bean in Spring to programmatically add default users. We’ll handle adding an admin user programmatically when implementing security (so we can hash the password properly rather than manual SQL).

### Security (JWT Authentication & RBAC)

Security is a critical part of our system. We will implement **JWT-based authentication** for stateless auth and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for authorizing user actions. Spring Security will be the backbone for securing our endpoints.

#### Authentication with JWT

**Overview:** We want users to log in with email/password and receive a JWT token. This token will be included in subsequent requests (usually in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`). The backend will verify the token and extract the user’s identity and roles from it, thereby authenticating the request. This approach has the advantage of being stateless (no server session to maintain) and is suitable for APIs used by SPAs (the React app).

**Password Storage:** We must never store plain passwords. When users register or when we set up an admin, we will hash passwords (using BCrypt, which Spring Security provides). Spring Security’s `PasswordEncoder` interface (with `BCryptPasswordEncoder`) will be used.

**Setting up Spring Security Config:** Create a config class, e.g., `SecurityConfig.java` in `com.example.deals.config`:

```java
package com.example.deals.config;

import com.example.deals.service.UserDetailsServiceImpl;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManager;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.authentication.configuration.AuthenticationConfiguration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }

    @Bean
    public AuthenticationManager authenticationManager(AuthenticationConfiguration authConfig) throws Exception {
        return authConfig.getAuthenticationManager();
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()  // disable CSRF for API (if using session cookies, enable accordingly)
            .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                .requestMatchers("/api/auth/**").permitAll()  // allow public auth endpoints
                .anyRequest().authenticated()                // secure all other endpoints
            )
            .httpBasic().disable()  // we won't use HTTP Basic
            .formLogin().disable(); // no form login
        // We'll add JWT filter integration later
        return http.build();
    }
}
```

This sets up Spring Security to:

- Use a `PasswordEncoder` bean (BCrypt).
- Expose an `AuthenticationManager` (needed to authenticate credentials manually in our login logic).
- Define which requests are secure: we allow `/api/auth/**` publicly (for login, registration), everything else requires auth.
- Disable default login forms as we are doing REST API login.
- (We will attach a JWT filter in a moment.)

**UserDetailsService and UserDetails:** Spring Security uses a `UserDetailsService` to load user information for authentication. We implement one that fetches our `User` from the database:

```java
package com.example.deals.service;

import com.example.deals.model.User;
import com.example.deals.repository.UserRepository;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.*;
import org.springframework.security.core.authority.SimpleGrantedAuthority;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

@Service
public class UserDetailsServiceImpl implements UserDetailsService {
    private final UserRepository userRepo;
    public UserDetailsServiceImpl(UserRepository repo) { this.userRepo = repo; }

    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String email) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        User user = userRepo.findByEmail(email)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found"));
        // Convert our User to Spring Security's UserDetails
        return new org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User(
                user.getEmail(),
                user.getPassword(),
                user.getRoles().stream()
                    .map(role -> new SimpleGrantedAuthority(role))
                    .collect(Collectors.toList())
        );
    }
}
```

This service is used to authenticate a user’s credentials during login (we will call it manually), or by Spring Security if we were to use its mechanisms.

**JWT Util (Token Provider):** We create a component to generate and validate JWTs. Using JJWT library:

```java
package com.example.deals.security;

import io.jsonwebtoken.*;
import io.jsonwebtoken.security.Keys;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.security.Key;

@Component
public class JwtTokenProvider {
    private final Key key = Keys.secretKeyFor(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256);
    private final long validity = 3600_000; // 1 hour in milliseconds

    public String generateToken(UserDetails userDetails) {
        String roles = userDetails.getAuthorities().stream()
                          .map(auth -> auth.getAuthority())
                          .collect(Collectors.joining(","));
        return Jwts.builder()
                   .setSubject(userDetails.getUsername())
                   .claim("roles", roles)
                   .setIssuedAt(new Date())
                   .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + validity))
                   .signWith(key)
                   .compact();
    }

    public boolean validateToken(String token) {
        try {
            Jwts.parserBuilder().setSigningKey(key).build().parseClaimsJws(token);
            return true;
        } catch (JwtException | IllegalArgumentException e) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    public String getUsernameFromToken(String token) {
        return Jwts.parserBuilder().setSigningKey(key).build()
                   .parseClaimsJws(token).getBody().getSubject();
    }

    public String getRolesFromToken(String token) {
        Claims claims = Jwts.parserBuilder().setSigningKey(key).build()
                   .parseClaimsJws(token).getBody();
        return (String) claims.get("roles");
    }
}
```

The `key` here is randomly generated each run. In a real system, you’d use a constant secret or a key pair (especially if multiple instances need to verify the same token). But for simplicity, this works; just note that restarting the app invalidates all existing tokens (since new random key). For dev, that’s fine; for prod, externalize the secret.

This provider:

- `generateToken` for a given authenticated user (UserDetails) – we encode username and roles.
- `validateToken` tries to parse the token, returns false if invalid/expired.
- `getUsernameFromToken` and `getRolesFromToken` to extract info.

**JWT Filter:** We need to intercept incoming requests to check for JWT in header. Spring Security allows adding filters. We can create `JwtAuthFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter`:

```java
@Component
public class JwtAuthFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
    @Autowired
    private JwtTokenProvider tokenProvider;
    @Autowired
    private UserDetailsServiceImpl userDetailsService;

    @Override
    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        String authHeader = request.getHeader("Authorization");
        if (authHeader != null && authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
            String token = authHeader.substring(7);
            if (tokenProvider.validateToken(token)) {
                String username = tokenProvider.getUsernameFromToken(token);
                UserDetails userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username);
                UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authToken =
                      new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, null, userDetails.getAuthorities());
                authToken.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(request));
                // Set authentication to SecurityContext
                SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authToken);
            }
        }
        // Continue filter chain
        filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
    }
}
```

This filter:

- Checks the `Authorization` header for a Bearer token.
- Validates token and if valid, loads the user details and manually sets an **Authentication** in the security context, so Spring Security knows the user is authenticated.
- If token is missing or invalid, it just doesn’t set auth (thus request will be unauthorized if it was required).
- We then always call `filterChain.doFilter` to let the request proceed.

We need to register this filter in our `SecurityConfig`. Modify the `filterChain` bean to add:

```java
@Autowired
private JwtAuthFilter jwtAuthFilter;

@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    ...
    http.addFilterBefore(jwtAuthFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
    return http.build();
}
```

This ensures our JWT filter runs before Spring’s default auth processing.

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

With authentication in place, RBAC is about restricting which roles can access which resources or perform which actions. We have several ways:

- **Endpoint level**: In controllers, use annotations like `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` on methods to restrict calls to certain roles.
- **Method level**: Similarly, on service methods if needed.
- **Within code**: Check roles in logic to decide what to do.

We’ll likely use a mix of endpoint and method security. Since we already configure Spring Security to require any authenticated user for all endpoints except `/auth/**`, we can further restrict specific endpoints:

- For example, only admins can delete deals or view all deals, whereas regular users can only view their own deals.

**Defining Roles:** We decided roles as strings (with prefix "ROLE\_"). Common pattern:

- ROLE_USER (basic user, perhaps a sales rep),
- ROLE_MANAGER (manager with elevated privileges),
- ROLE_ADMIN (system admin who can manage users and everything).

Our JWT includes roles claim. When we set `SimpleGrantedAuthority(role)` in UserDetailsService, Spring expects the role name to be like "ROLE*ADMIN". These map to `hasRole('ADMIN')` usage in annotations (Spring automatically adds "ROLE*" prefix when using hasRole).

**Example RBAC rules for our system:**

- **Deals:**
  - Create deal: any authenticated user (ROLE_USER or higher) can create a deal.
  - View own deals: a user can view deals where they are the owner.
  - View all deals: perhaps managers and admins can see all deals.
  - Update deal: if we allow only owner to update, then check in code if current user matches deal.owner or if user has manager/admin role.
  - Delete deal: only admins (or perhaps managers) can delete deals.
- **Users:**
  - Listing users or creating users might be admin-only operations (if we even have an endpoint for that).
  - Changing roles, etc., admin only.

**Using `@PreAuthorize`:** Spring Security allows method-level protection with SpEL expressions. For instance:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN') or #id == principal.id")
@GetMapping("/users/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<UserDto> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) { ... }
```

This hypothetical example means: allow if admin or if the id in path equals the current authenticated user’s id (`principal` refers to the UserDetails). We may not need such dynamic checks for our use case, but it's available.

For deals, we might not use PreAuthorize on every method but rather check inside service methods:

```java
public Deal updateDealStatus(Long dealId, String newStatus, User currentUser) {
    Deal deal = dealRepo.findById(dealId)...;
    if (!currentUser.hasRole("ADMIN") && !currentUser.equals(deal.getOwner())) {
        throw new AccessDeniedException("Not allowed to update this deal");
    }
    // proceed to update status
}
```

However, to leverage Spring, we could also use global method security:

- Enable method security: add `@EnableMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)` to our SecurityConfig class.
- Then in the controller or service, use `@PreAuthorize`.

**Role Hierarchy (optional):** Sometimes, we define that e.g. ADMIN implicitly has MANAGER and USER privileges, MANAGER has USER. Spring Security can define a role hierarchy. Given the size of our app, we can handle it manually by just assigning multiple roles if needed (or checking as in “if admin or owner”).

**Summary of RBAC Implementation:**  
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) ensures that only authorized users (based on roles) can perform certain actions ([Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Spring Boot](https://basicutils.com/learn/spring-security/implementing-role-based-access-control-rbac-spring-boot#:~:text=Role,without%20affecting%20user%20permissions%20directly)). We’ve captured roles in JWT and in the Spring Security context. The enforcement is done either through:

- Endpoint configuration (like `.requestMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")` in security config or `@PreAuthorize`).
- Explicit checks in the code where needed.

> **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** RBAC is a security paradigm where permissions are assigned to roles, and users gain those permissions by being assigned roles ([Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Spring Boot](https://basicutils.com/learn/spring-security/implementing-role-based-access-control-rbac-spring-boot#:~:text=Role,without%20affecting%20user%20permissions%20directly)). This simplifies management – e.g., assign a "Manager" role to a user and they automatically get all permissions of managers, without needing individual permission assignments. We enforce RBAC in our app by checking roles in security annotations and code logic.

Now that we have the core security in place (user authentication and role authorization), we can proceed to implement the REST API endpoints for our domain (deals, auth, etc.), knowing that they are secured.

#### Building Auth Endpoints

We need endpoints for:

- **User Registration (Sign Up)** – optional if we allow self sign-up. If this system is internal, maybe an admin creates users.
- **User Login (Sign In)** – user provides credentials and gets a JWT.
- Possibly a **Token Refresh** if we implement refresh tokens (not required but good practice to avoid short token expiry issues).

For simplicity:

- We’ll implement a `/api/auth/login` endpoint for obtaining JWT.
- If needed, an `/api/auth/register` for new users (maybe only admin can create new users in our context, so we might skip public register).
- We won’t implement refresh tokens to keep things straightforward; instead, access tokens can be relatively short-lived (e.g., 1 hour as set) and the user will log in again or we can later add a refresh token mechanism.

**AuthController example:**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/auth")
public class AuthController {
    @Autowired AuthenticationManager authManager;
    @Autowired JwtTokenProvider tokenProvider;
    @Autowired UserRepository userRepo;
    @Autowired PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    @PostMapping("/login")
    public ResponseEntity<?> login(@RequestBody LoginRequest loginReq) {
        try {
            Authentication authentication = authManager.authenticate(
                new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(loginReq.getEmail(), loginReq.getPassword()));
            // If we reach here, auth was successful
            UserDetails userDetails = (UserDetails) authentication.getPrincipal();
            String jwt = tokenProvider.generateToken(userDetails);
            return ResponseEntity.ok(new JwtResponse(jwt));
        } catch (BadCredentialsException ex) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED).body("Invalid credentials");
        }
    }

    @PostMapping("/register")
    public ResponseEntity<?> register(@RequestBody SignupRequest signUpReq) {
        if (userRepo.findByEmail(signUpReq.getEmail()).isPresent()) {
            return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body("Email is already taken");
        }
        User user = new User();
        user.setEmail(signUpReq.getEmail());
        user.setName(signUpReq.getName());
        user.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode(signUpReq.getPassword()));
        user.getRoles().add("ROLE_USER");
        userRepo.save(user);
        return ResponseEntity.ok("User registered successfully");
    }
}
```

We’d have DTO classes `LoginRequest`, `SignupRequest`, `JwtResponse` to represent the JSON payloads:

```java
public class LoginRequest { private String email; private String password; /* getters/setters */ }
public class SignupRequest { private String email; private String name; private String password; /* getters/setters */ }
public class JwtResponse { private String token; public JwtResponse(String t) { this.token = t;} public String getToken(){return token;} }
```

The login uses `AuthenticationManager` which in turn uses our `UserDetailsServiceImpl` and `PasswordEncoder` under the hood to authenticate. If successful, we generate a token and return it (perhaps along with user info or roles if needed). On failure, return 401.

Registration simply creates a new user with ROLE_USER by default.

At this point, we can test the auth flow:

- Start the app, ensure a user exists. Possibly call `register` or we manually inserted an admin in data.sql. If none, use register to create one.
- Use Postman: call POST `/api/auth/login` with JSON `{"email": "...", "password": "..."}`. Expect a `token` in response if correct. If using the admin user we inserted via SQL, recall the password must be encoded. Alternatively, to create an initial admin, you might run the app with a CommandLineRunner that creates an admin on startup if not present.

**Testing JWT:** Once you have a token from login, test a protected endpoint (like `/api/deals` which we will implement soon) by adding header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Without the header or with an invalid token, you should get 401 Unauthorized. With the token, you should get a proper response.

This confirms our security setup: JWT filter should parse and set auth, and then our controllers will allow access.

### REST API Development

With the groundwork laid (project, database, security), we can focus on implementing the actual business functionality: managing deals (and optionally users or notes). We will create controllers and services for **Deals** and possibly for **Users** (to allow admin to manage users, or at least to get the current user’s profile).

Let's define the main endpoints we want for deals:

- `GET /api/deals` – get a list of deals. Possibly with query params to filter by status or owner. We’ll likely allow:
  - If an admin or manager, you get all deals (maybe with ability to filter by owner).
  - If a normal user, you get only your deals.
- `GET /api/deals/{id}` – get details of a single deal. If you are owner or admin/manager.
- `POST /api/deals` – create a new deal. The `owner` is implicitly the current user (unless an admin is creating on behalf of someone? We'll assume user creates their own deals).
- `PUT /api/deals/{id}` – update a deal (could be full update or partial). We allow changing fields like title, description, status, value. Possibly restrict that normal user cannot mark a deal as "Won" without manager approval (business rule, optional).
- `DELETE /api/deals/{id}` – delete a deal (likely only admin or maybe the owner if it's in a certain state).

We should also have an endpoint to list statuses or something, but we can hardcode allowed statuses in front/back.

Additionally:

- `GET /api/users` (admin only): list users (just to see user info).
- `POST /api/users` (admin only): create a new user (could be an admin function instead of open registration).
- Or `GET /api/users/me`: get current user's details (to display profile).

We will implement primarily deals since that’s our main entity.

**DealService:** We create a service class that contains the main business logic for deals. For example:

```java
@Service
public class DealService {
    @Autowired DealRepository dealRepo;
    @Autowired UserRepository userRepo;

    public Deal createDeal(Deal deal, User owner) {
        deal.setOwner(owner);
        deal.setStatus("NEW");
        deal.setCreatedAt(LocalDateTime.now());
        deal.setUpdatedAt(LocalDateTime.now());
        return dealRepo.save(deal);
    }

    public List<Deal> listDealsForUser(User user) {
        if (user.getRoles().contains("ROLE_ADMIN") || user.getRoles().contains("ROLE_MANAGER")) {
            return dealRepo.findAll();
        } else {
            return dealRepo.findByOwnerId(user.getId());
        }
    }

    public Deal getDeal(Long id, User user) {
        Deal deal = dealRepo.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Deal not found"));
        if (!canUserAccessDeal(user, deal)) {
            throw new AccessDeniedException("Not allowed");
        }
        return deal;
    }

    public Deal updateDeal(Long id, Deal updatedDeal, User user) {
        Deal deal = getDeal(id, user);
        // Only owner or admin can update (as ensured by getDeal check)
        deal.setTitle(updatedDeal.getTitle());
        deal.setDescription(updatedDeal.getDescription());
        deal.setValue(updatedDeal.getValue());
        if (updatedDeal.getStatus() != null) {
            // If user is manager/admin or is owner updating to allowed status:
            deal.setStatus(updatedDeal.getStatus());
        }
        deal.setUpdatedAt(LocalDateTime.now());
        return dealRepo.save(deal);
    }

    public void deleteDeal(Long id, User user) {
        Deal deal = getDeal(id, user);
        if (!user.getRoles().contains("ROLE_ADMIN")) {
            throw new AccessDeniedException("Only admin can delete deals");
        }
        dealRepo.delete(deal);
    }

    private boolean canUserAccessDeal(User user, Deal deal) {
        if (user.getRoles().contains("ROLE_ADMIN") || user.getRoles().contains("ROLE_MANAGER")) {
            return true;
        }
        return deal.getOwner().getId().equals(user.getId());
    }
}
```

This is a rough outline: `ResourceNotFoundException` and `AccessDeniedException` are custom (or from Spring) exceptions we can throw to yield 404 or 403 responses respectively (we’d handle those via an `@ControllerAdvice` globally to return proper JSON).

The service uses `user.getRoles()` which is a Set of strings in our User entity. Note: We need our `User` entity available in the controller. We might get `UserDetails` from Spring Security and then fetch the `User` entity from DB. We can implement a helper method or use an AuthenticationFacade to get current user.

**Controller Implementation:**

**DealController:**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/deals")
public class DealController {
    @Autowired DealService dealService;
    @Autowired UserRepository userRepo;

    // Utility to get current User entity from security context
    private User getCurrentUser() {
        String email = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getName();
        return userRepo.findByEmail(email).orElseThrow();
    }

    @GetMapping
    public List<Deal> getDeals() {
        User currentUser = getCurrentUser();
        return dealService.listDealsForUser(currentUser);
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Deal> getDealById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        User currentUser = getCurrentUser();
        Deal deal = dealService.getDeal(id, currentUser);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(deal);
    }

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Deal> createDeal(@RequestBody Deal dealRequest) {
        User currentUser = getCurrentUser();
        Deal created = dealService.createDeal(dealRequest, currentUser);
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(created);
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Deal> updateDeal(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Deal dealRequest) {
        User currentUser = getCurrentUser();
        Deal updated = dealService.updateDeal(id, dealRequest, currentUser);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(updated);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<?> deleteDeal(@PathVariable Long id) {
        User currentUser = getCurrentUser();
        dealService.deleteDeal(id, currentUser);
        return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
    }
}
```

This uses the raw `Deal` entity in request/response. In real applications, it's better to use DTOs to avoid exposing internal fields and to have control over serialization. For brevity, we might use entities directly (which will include owner info etc. possibly causing recursion, we might need to mark some relations as `@JsonIgnore`). But an advanced audience would understand adapting this to use DTOs or projections as needed.

For example, to avoid sending the user's password hash in the JSON, ensure in `User` entity we mark `password` with `@JsonIgnore` so it’s not serialized. Or do not return the full User in Deal’s JSON. Alternatively, define a `DealResponse` DTO that includes owner’s name or id but not the password.

**RBAC enforcement in Controller:** We did checks in service. If we wanted to use annotations:

- Could do `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN') or hasRole('MANAGER') or #id == principal.id")` on getDeal etc. But our logic is fine.

**Edge cases & validations:** We should add validation like:

- Ensure title is not empty, value >= 0, etc. Use Bean Validation (JSR-303) annotations in entity/DTO and `@Valid` in controller param to enforce. For brevity, we'll assume inputs are valid or skip detailing that.

**UserController (optional):** If admin needs to manage users:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
public class UserController {
    @Autowired UserRepository userRepo;
    @GetMapping
    public List<User> listUsers() {
        return userRepo.findAll();
    }
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return userRepo.findById(id).orElseThrow();
    }
    // Additional user management endpoints (create user, update user role, etc.)
}
```

We restrict all methods to ADMIN via class-level PreAuthorize (only an admin can hit these endpoints).

At this stage, we should have a working backend that covers:

- Authentication (login to get JWT).
- Authorization (the filter checks JWT, service checks roles).
- CRUD operations for deals with appropriate access control.
- Basic user management (login/register, plus an admin list if needed).

**Testing the REST API:**

- **Authentication**: Use Postman to register a new user (if implemented) or ensure one exists in DB. Then POST to `/api/auth/login` to get a JWT.
- **Create Deal**: Take the JWT, set `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, do POST `/api/deals` with JSON body:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Big Sale Deal",
    "description": "Deal with ACME Corp for 100 units",
    "value": 50000.0
  }
  ```
  Expect a 201 Created with the deal JSON (including an id and status "NEW", owner info etc.). The owner should be the user who created (the current user).
- **List Deals**: GET `/api/deals` with the same token. If user is normal, it returns only their deals. If you logged in as admin, it returns all deals.
- **Update Deal**: PUT `/api/deals/{id}` for a deal you own with a JSON to change something (e.g., `"status": "IN_PROGRESS"`). If you are the owner or admin, it should update and return the new details. If not allowed (e.g., user tries to update someone else’s deal), you should get 403.
- **Delete Deal**: If admin, try DELETE `/api/deals/{id}`. On success, 204 No Content. If a normal user tries, it should be forbidden by our service logic.

All these confirm the correctness of our RBAC logic. By now, the backend is functionally complete.

In a real app, we would also implement features like searching deals by criteria (could be by adding query params to GET /deals and using JPA Specifications or QueryDSL for flexibility). For example, `GET /api/deals?status=WON&ownerId=5` to filter. Due to length, we’ll skip implementing a generic search, but one can imagine adding methods in `DealRepository` or using `JpaSpecificationExecutor`.

### Optimization & Performance Enhancements

Performance should always be considered, especially for an enterprise app. We will discuss various optimization techniques relevant to our backend:

- **Database Query Optimization:** Ensure we fetch only what is needed and use indexes.
- **Caching:** Leverage caching for frequently accessed data to reduce DB hits.
- **Efficient Transactions and Batching:** For example, if multiple inserts or updates happen, see if they can be batched.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Offload long-running tasks from request thread (though our app is fairly straightforward, heavy tasks like sending emails or generating reports could be async).
- **Pagination:** Not an optimization per se, but ensure list endpoints paginate results (to avoid returning huge lists of deals).

**Database Indexes & Query Tuning:** With JPA/Hibernate:

- We should ensure key queries use indexes. E.g., `findByOwnerId` will benefit from an index on the `owner_id` column in deals. MySQL will likely create one because it’s a foreign key (InnoDB auto-indexes foreign keys). The `status` column might need an index if filtering by status often.
- If we have a query for high-value deals, an index on `value` could help if the dataset is large and query selective. But indexing a numeric column that is often ranged might not be as effective unless it's often filtered.
- Use **joins fetch** to avoid N+1 queries. For instance, if listing deals for an admin, and we want to show the owner’s name, we should fetch deals with owners in one query. We can modify `DealRepository.findAll()` to something like:

  ```java
  @Query("SELECT d FROM Deal d JOIN FETCH d.owner")
  List<Deal> findAllWithOwner();
  ```

  This way, it loads owner data eagerly to avoid querying for each deal’s owner. Alternatively, mark `@ManyToOne(fetch=EAGER)` (which is default for ManyToOne, so we’re good – owner is fetched with the deal by default since we didn't specify lazy. One must be cautious: EAGER fetch on collections (OneToMany) can cause heavy queries, but here deals->owner is fine).

- **Use Projections or DTOs for read queries:** If we had a very large object graph, we could use JPA projections to fetch only needed fields (but for our simple case, not necessary).

**Caching:** Spring provides an annotation-based caching (`@EnableCaching` and `@Cacheable` annotations). If we find that certain data is read often but changes rarely, caching can help.

- Example: a method `getDeal(id)` could be annotated with `@Cacheable("deals")` to cache each deal by id. Subsequent calls will hit cache instead of DB until the deal is updated (then we’d use `@CacheEvict` on update).
- Similarly, `listDealsForUser(user)` – if the data isn’t changing too frequently, caching per user can help.
- We could use an in-memory cache like ConcurrentHashMap via Spring’s SimpleCacheManager for quick setup, or integrate a caching solution like Ehcache, Caffeine, or Redis for distributed cache. Spring Boot makes enabling a cache like Ehcache straightforward via dependencies and config.

> **Caching benefits:** “Caching is an effective strategy for boosting Spring Boot application speed by eliminating the need for expensive computations or database requests ([Performance Optimization Techniques in Spring Boot Applications - DEV Community](https://dev.to/kunal123/performance-optimization-techniques-in-spring-boot-applications-31f1#:~:text=Caching%20is%20an%20effective%20strategy,expensive%20computations%20or%20database%20requests)).” By storing frequently accessed data in memory, we reduce load on the database and improve response times. For example, caching the list of deals for a manager might save repeated heavy queries when the data hasn’t changed.

We might enable caching in our app:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCaching
public class DealsManagementSystemApplication { ... }
```

Then in DealService:

```java
@Cacheable(value="dealsByUser", key="#user.id")
public List<Deal> listDealsForUser(User user) { ... }
```

And `@CacheEvict(value="dealsByUser", key="#user.id")` on methods that modify deals (to clear cache for that user’s list).

**Concurrency Considerations:** Spring Boot by default is multi-threaded (each HTTP request on Tomcat is a thread). Our use of JPA is mostly fine in concurrent environment as long as each request has its own EntityManager (Spring handles that via OpenEntityManagerInView if enabled). We should be cautious that our service methods, e.g., updateDeal, are transactional (by default Spring Data JPA repository methods are transactional). We may want to annotate our service methods with `@Transactional` to ensure atomicity and consistent session for lazy loading. For example:

```java
@Transactional
public Deal updateDeal(...){ ... }
```

This ensures the deal fetched and then saved are in one transaction.

**Asynchronous Operations:** If some actions are slow (e.g., sending a notification email when a deal is won), we might mark those with `@Async` to run in a separate thread pool, so the HTTP response can return quickly. That requires enabling async (`@EnableAsync`) and having a TaskExecutor. We can consider that in “Notifications” section.

**Performance Testing & Monitoring:** Use tools like JProfiler or Java Flight Recorder for profiling if needed, or simply log execution times of certain operations to detect slow points. Spring Boot’s Actuator can provide metrics. We can integrate Micrometer to get metrics on query execution times, etc., and feed to Prometheus/Grafana (discussed in Monitoring section).

**Summary of Backend Optimizations:**

- Optimize database interactions by using indexes and efficient queries ([Performance Optimization Techniques in Spring Boot Applications - DEV Community](https://dev.to/kunal123/performance-optimization-techniques-in-spring-boot-applications-31f1#:~:text=Efficient%20database%20interactions%20are%20critical,enhance%20query%20performance%20and%20latency)). For instance, adding appropriate indexes on search fields (like status) can **drastically enhance query performance and reduce latency ([Performance Optimization Techniques in Spring Boot Applications - DEV Community](https://dev.to/kunal123/performance-optimization-techniques-in-spring-boot-applications-31f1#:~:text=Efficient%20database%20interactions%20are%20critical,enhance%20query%20performance%20and%20latency))**.
- Add caching at the service layer for frequently accessed data to reduce repetitive DB hits ([Performance Optimization Techniques in Spring Boot Applications - DEV Community](https://dev.to/kunal123/performance-optimization-techniques-in-spring-boot-applications-31f1#:~:text=Caching%20is%20an%20effective%20strategy,expensive%20computations%20or%20database%20requests)). For example, cache the results of expensive queries like complex reports or lists.
- Ensure heavy tasks (if any) are done asynchronously or offline (e.g., generating a PDF report of all deals might be offloaded).
- Streamline JSON serialization by avoiding large data transfers (use pagination and filtering).
- Use content compression (enable gzip on responses in Spring Boot settings or via proxy) to speed up large responses.
- Use connection pooling (Spring Boot uses HikariCP by default which is efficient) and tune it if needed for high concurrency.

At this stage, our backend should not only be functional but also reasonably efficient. We can handle thousands of deals and users, and scale horizontally (multiple instances with a load balancer) since we are stateless (except the DB which can be scaled by using a cluster or read replicas if needed in a real scenario).

### Testing the Backend (Unit, Integration & Postman)

Testing is crucial to ensure our backend works as expected and to prevent regressions as the code evolves. We will employ several levels of testing:

- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual classes or layers (services, utilities) in isolation using JUnit and Mockito.
- **Integration Testing:** Testing the system components together, e.g., using Spring Boot’s test slice to test the web layer or repository layer with the actual Spring context.
- **End-to-End Testing (API tests):** Using Postman or other tools to test the running application’s REST API as a whole, possibly with a running database.

#### Unit Testing with JUnit & Mockito

We will use **JUnit 5** (included by default in Spring Boot starter test) and **Mockito** (also included) for mocking dependencies. Some examples:

- **Service Layer Test:** We can test `DealService` by mocking `DealRepository` and `UserRepository`. This way, we test the business logic (like RBAC enforcement) without needing a DB.
- **Utility Class Test:** e.g., test `JwtTokenProvider` separately to ensure tokens generate and parse correctly (maybe using a fixed key for test determinism).
- **Security Config Test:** Could ensure URLs are secured/unsecured as expected using Spring Security’s test utilities (though this can also be integration tested with MockMvc).

Let's illustrate a unit test for DealService:

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
public class DealServiceTest {

    @InjectMocks
    private DealService dealService;
    @Mock
    private DealRepository dealRepo;
    @Mock
    private UserRepository userRepo;

    @Test
    void listDealsForUser_shouldReturnOwnDealsForUserRole() {
        User user = new User();
        user.setId(1L);
        user.getRoles().add("ROLE_USER");
        List<Deal> fakeDeals = Arrays.asList(new Deal(), new Deal());
        // Stub repository call for owner's deals
        Mockito.when(dealRepo.findByOwnerId(1L)).thenReturn(fakeDeals);

        List<Deal> result = dealService.listDealsForUser(user);
        assertEquals(2, result.size());
        Mockito.verify(dealRepo).findByOwnerId(1L);
    }

    @Test
    void listDealsForUser_shouldReturnAllDealsForAdminRole() {
        User admin = new User();
        admin.setId(2L);
        admin.getRoles().add("ROLE_ADMIN");
        List<Deal> allDeals = Arrays.asList(new Deal(), new Deal(), new Deal());
        Mockito.when(dealRepo.findAll()).thenReturn(allDeals);

        List<Deal> result = dealService.listDealsForUser(admin);
        assertEquals(3, result.size());
        Mockito.verify(dealRepo).findAll();
    }

    @Test
    void getDeal_shouldThrowIfNotOwnerOrAdmin() {
        User user = new User(); user.setId(1L); user.getRoles().add("ROLE_USER");
        User other = new User(); other.setId(2L);
        Deal deal = new Deal(); deal.setId(5L); deal.setOwner(other);
        Mockito.when(dealRepo.findById(5L)).thenReturn(Optional.of(deal));
        // Expect an AccessDeniedException when user 1 tries to access deal owned by user 2
        assertThrows(AccessDeniedException.class, () -> {
            dealService.getDeal(5L, user);
        });
    }
}
```

This uses Mockito to fake repository outputs and verify logic. We test both allowed and not allowed scenarios.

We would write similar tests for `AuthController` (but usually better to test controllers with MockMvc integration tests), or `JwtTokenProvider` (we can directly call generateToken, then validateToken, etc., assert that a token from generate is considered valid and subject matches, etc.).

**Running Unit Tests:** Use Maven (`mvn test`) or within IDE to run. They should run quickly since no Spring context is started (we used MockitoExtension to avoid full context).

#### Integration Testing with Spring Boot

Spring Boot’s test framework allows starting the application (or part of it) in a test environment. For example:

- Use `@SpringBootTest` to load the full application context and possibly connect to a test database (we can use an in-memory H2 database to avoid requiring a real MySQL).
- Use `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` with SpringBootTest to get a `MockMvc` object to perform HTTP requests to controllers without actual server, but through the Spring MVC stack.
- Or use slice annotations like `@WebMvcTest` for just controller layer (with mocked services), `@DataJpaTest` for repository layer with H2, etc.

**Example: Testing Controllers with MockMvc** (which simulates HTTP calls):

```java
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
class DealControllerTest {

    @Autowired MockMvc mockMvc;
    @Autowired UserRepository userRepo;
    @Autowired DealRepository dealRepo;
    @Autowired JwtTokenProvider tokenProvider;
    @Autowired PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    private String userToken;
    private String adminToken;

    @BeforeEach
    void setup() {
        // Set up a test user and admin in the database
        userRepo.deleteAll();
        dealRepo.deleteAll();
        User user = new User();
        user.setEmail("user@test.com");
        user.setName("Test User");
        user.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode("password"));
        user.getRoles().add("ROLE_USER");
        userRepo.save(user);
        User admin = new User();
        admin.setEmail("admin@test.com");
        admin.setName("Admin User");
        admin.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode("adminpass"));
        admin.getRoles().add("ROLE_ADMIN");
        userRepo.save(admin);
        // generate JWTs for them
        UserDetails userDetails = new org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword(),
                Collections.singletonList(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_USER")));
        userToken = tokenProvider.generateToken(userDetails);
        UserDetails adminDetails = new org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User(admin.getEmail(), admin.getPassword(),
                Collections.singletonList(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_ADMIN")));
        adminToken = tokenProvider.generateToken(adminDetails);
    }

    @Test
    void createDealAndGetIt_flow() throws Exception {
        // User creates a deal
        String dealJson = "{\"title\":\"Test Deal\",\"description\":\"A deal\",\"value\":1000}";
        MvcResult createResult = mockMvc.perform(post("/api/deals")
                    .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + userToken)
                    .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
                    .content(dealJson))
                .andExpect(status().isCreated())
                .andReturn();
        String responseBody = createResult.getResponse().getContentAsString();
        // Extract deal ID from response (could use Jackson to map JSON to object)
        // For simplicity, assume response contains `"id":`
        Long createdDealId = // parse from responseBody;
        // Fetch the deal
        mockMvc.perform(get("/api/deals/" + createdDealId)
                    .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + userToken))
                .andExpect(status().isOk())
                .andExpect(jsonPath("$.title").value("Test Deal"))
                .andExpect(jsonPath("$.owner.email").value("user@test.com"));
    }

    @Test
    void userCannotDeleteDeal() throws Exception {
        // Admin creates a deal
        Deal deal = new Deal();
        deal.setTitle("Admin Deal");
        deal.setValue(500.0);
        deal.setStatus("NEW");
        deal.setOwner(userRepo.findByEmail("admin@test.com").get());
        dealRepo.save(deal);
        // User (not owner, not admin) tries to delete
        mockMvc.perform(delete("/api/deals/" + deal.getId())
                    .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + userToken))
                .andExpect(status().isForbidden() /* since our service throws AccessDenied, which translates to 403 */);
    }
}
```

This test:

- Uses real Spring Boot with an H2 database (since no MySQL config likely provided, by default SpringBootTest will use H2 if available, or we can force via properties).
- It sets up data in the H2 via repositories (since they are autowired).
- It generates real JWT tokens using our provider (alternatively, we could hit the /login endpoint via MockMvc to get token, but that complicates test flows).
- Then it uses MockMvc to simulate HTTP calls to our API endpoints, and verifies status codes and JSON content with `jsonPath` (which is a way to assert values in JSON response).

This is an integration test covering a complete flow: from hitting the HTTP endpoint, through security filter, controller, service, repository to DB, and back out.

**Running Integration Tests:** They are slower because they start context and possibly the database, but they ensure everything is wired correctly. Use Maven or IDE to run them. Spring Boot tests also by default rollback transactions at the end of each test (it does that if using @Transactional in test, or by default in @DataJpaTest).

#### Testing with Postman (Manual and Automated)

After unit and integration tests, it’s also beneficial to manually test the running application as a whole, especially to simulate real conditions (like connecting to a real MySQL, etc.). We already did some of that in earlier sections with Postman.

To formalize:

- Create a **Postman Collection** named "Deals Management API".
- Add requests for each endpoint:
  - Auth folder: Login (POST /api/auth/login), Register.
  - Deals folder: Get all deals, Get deal by id, Create deal, Update deal, Delete deal.
  - Users folder: perhaps Get all users (admin).
- Use **Pre-request scripts** or manual steps to set a token. For instance, after login, copy the token from the response and set it as an environment variable `token`. Then in subsequent requests, use `Bearer {{token}}` in the Authorization header.

Postman allows writing tests (in JavaScript) that run after a request:

```js
// Example: After login request
if (responseCode.code === 200) {
  var resp = JSON.parse(responseBody);
  pm.environment.set("token", resp.token);
}
```

This automatically stores the token for use in later requests.

You can then chain requests: run login, then get deals, create deal, etc., as a sequence.

**Automated Postman Tests:** You can run the collection runner in Postman to execute all requests with their tests. If we had more time, we could add assertions in Postman tests (like verify a GET /deals returns 200 and contains certain fields). Since we already have integration tests doing similar, Postman tests can be lighter.

**Newman for CI:** Newman is Postman’s command-line runner which can run collections as part of CI pipeline, giving a way to do end-to-end tests in a pipeline after deployment. We’ll mention that in CI section as a possibility.

In summary, our backend testing strategy is:

- Use JUnit/Mockito for fast unit tests of core logic ([Spring Boot: Best Practices for Scalable Applications](https://www.codewalnut.com/insights/spring-boot-best-practices-for-scalable-applications#:~:text=understand%2C%20maintain%2C%20and%20extend,free)), ensuring reliability of individual components.
- Use Spring Boot integration tests for verifying the system behavior (including security) end-to-end in a controlled environment.
- Use Postman (or curl, etc.) for exploratory testing and regression checks of the deployed service (with real DB).
- Possibly include those as automated integration tests in CI.

By covering these bases, we get confidence in our backend before moving to the frontend development.

---

## Developing the Frontend (React.js)

With a robust backend in place, we turn to building the frontend of the Deals Management System using **React.js**. The frontend will be a single-page application (SPA) that interacts with our REST API. In this chapter, we cover advanced React concepts relevant to our application: setting up the project with modern tools, managing state using Context API or Redux Toolkit, creating reusable UI components (with a design library like Material-UI or utility CSS like Tailwind), integrating API calls with proper handling of JWT authentication, optimizing performance, and testing the React app.

### Advanced React Setup

**Project Initialization:** We will start a new React project. There are multiple ways to scaffold a React app:

- **Create React App (CRA):** A popular CLI that sets up a React project with build configuration pre-made.
- **Vite:** A newer, fast build tool that can scaffold React apps too (and is typically faster in development).
- **Next.js:** If SEO or server-side rendering were needed (not in our case for an internal tool), Next could be used.

We’ll go with **Create React App** for simplicity. Make sure Node/NPM are installed, then run:

```bash
npx create-react-app deals-frontend
```

This will create a `deals-frontend` directory with a basic React application. Navigate into it:

```bash
cd deals-frontend
npm start
```

This should start the dev server (on default port 3000) and open a browser with the CRA default page. That confirms the setup.

We should clean up initial boilerplate:

- Remove or adjust the `src/App.css`, `src/logo.svg`, etc., as needed.
- Ensure `src/App.js` is minimal, perhaps something like:
  ```jsx
  function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Deals Management System</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
  export default App;
  ```
- If using TypeScript, we could have done `npx create-react-app deals-frontend --template typescript`. But sticking to JS for now.

**Project Structure:** As our app grows, we should organize files meaningfully:

```
src/
  ├── components/       # Reusable components (buttons, layout, etc.)
  ├── pages/            # Page components (Dashboard, DealsList, DealDetails, Login, etc.)
  ├── services/         # API service functions (e.g., dealsApi.js for all deal-related calls)
  ├── context/          # Context providers if using Context API
  ├── store/            # If using Redux Toolkit, store setup and slices
  ├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
  ├── App.js
  └── index.js
```

We’ll refine as we implement features.

**Routing:** We will likely have multiple pages (Login, Deals List, Deal Form, etc.). We should set up React Router.
Install React Router:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom@6
```

In `src/App.js`, we can configure routes:

```jsx
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Routes,
  Route,
  Navigate,
} from "react-router-dom";
import DealsList from "./pages/DealsList";
import DealDetails from "./pages/DealDetails";
import Login from "./pages/Login";
import NotFound from "./pages/NotFound";
// ... other imports like context providers

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      {/* Possibly wrap routes in AuthProvider context, etc. */}
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
        <Route path="/deals" element={<DealsList />} />
        <Route path="/deals/:id" element={<DealDetails />} />
        <Route path="/" element={<Navigate to="/deals" />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

This sets up navigation: default route goes to deals list (once logged in), and any unknown route to a NotFound component.

We’ll implement these page components soon.

**State Management Strategy:** For an app of this size, we need to manage global state like:

- The currently logged-in user (or at least their authentication status and token).
- Possibly the list of deals in a central store if multiple components need it (or we can fetch as needed).
- UI state like a loading spinner, or a global notification message.

React offers multiple options:

- **Context API + useReducer:** We can create a context for Auth, another for maybe Deals if needed. Using `useContext` hook allows any component to access global state without prop drilling.
- **Redux Toolkit:** For more complex state needs or if we plan to scale the app, Redux Toolkit provides a structured approach to global state. It might be considered overkill for simple apps, but since the prompt suggests Redux Toolkit, we will illustrate how to integrate it.

We can actually combine approaches:
Use Context for simple things (like theme or minor state), and Redux for main data if desired. But often it's one or the other for overlapping concerns.

Given an advanced dev audience, using **Redux Toolkit (RTK)** is appropriate to demonstrate enterprise state management:

> **Redux Toolkit** is the recommended way to use Redux today, as it eliminates boilerplate and provides utilities like slices and query caching, making Redux development more efficient ([The Great Redux Toolkit Debate - DEV Community](https://dev.to/srmagura/the-great-redux-toolkit-debate-5045#:~:text=Redux%20Toolkit%20aims%20to%20eliminate,Its%20features%20include)).

Let’s set up Redux:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

Create `src/store/index.js`:

```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import authReducer from "./authSlice";
import dealsReducer from "./dealsSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    auth: authReducer,
    deals: dealsReducer,
  },
});
```

This sets up a store with two slices: `auth` and `deals` (we'll define them next).

**Auth Slice (`authSlice.js`):** manages login state.

```js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialToken = localStorage.getItem("token");
const initialUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user")); // if we store user info
const initialState = {
  token: initialToken || null,
  user: initialUser || null,
  isAuthenticated: !!initialToken,
};

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: "auth",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    loginSuccess: (state, action) => {
      state.token = action.payload.token;
      state.user = action.payload.user;
      state.isAuthenticated = true;
    },
    logout: (state) => {
      state.token = null;
      state.user = null;
      state.isAuthenticated = false;
    },
  },
});

export const { loginSuccess, logout } = authSlice.actions;
export default authSlice.reducer;
```

We assume upon login we get user info and token (we might call the API and get token, then fetch user info with that token, or encode user info in token if small).

We use localStorage to persist login so that a refresh of the page keeps user logged in (with token).

**Deals Slice (`dealsSlice.js`):** manages the deals list and current deal maybe.

```js
import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import axios from "axios";

export const fetchDeals = createAsyncThunk(
  "deals/fetchAll",
  async (_, thunkAPI) => {
    const state = thunkAPI.getState();
    const token = state.auth.token;
    const response = await axios.get("/api/deals", {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    });
    return response.data;
  }
);

const dealsSlice = createSlice({
  name: "deals",
  initialState: { list: [], status: "idle", error: null },
  reducers: {
    // We might add a dealUpdate or delete local reducers later
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchDeals.pending, (state) => {
        state.status = "loading";
      })
      .addCase(fetchDeals.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.status = "succeeded";
        state.list = action.payload;
      })
      .addCase(fetchDeals.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.status = "failed";
        state.error = action.error.message;
      });
  },
});
export default dealsSlice.reducer;
```

Here we use **createAsyncThunk** to fetch deals asynchronously (handles dispatching pending/fulfilled/rejected). We could similarly create thunks for createDeal, updateDeal, etc., or handle them via components calling the API and dispatching actions.

**Redux Provider:** In `index.js`, wrap App with Redux Provider:

```jsx
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./store";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Now any component can use `useSelector` to get state and `useDispatch` to dispatch actions.

**Context API (alternative or additional):** If not using Redux, we could create AuthContext:

```jsx
const AuthContext = createContext(null);

function AuthProvider({children}) {
  const [authState, setAuthState] = useState({ user: null, token: null });
  const login = (token, user) => { setAuthState({ token, user }); localStorage.setItem(...); };
  const logout = () => { setAuthState({ user:null, token:null }); localStorage.clear(...); };
  return <AuthContext.Provider value={{...authState, login, logout}}>
    {children}
  </AuthContext.Provider>
}
```

Then wrap Router with <AuthProvider>. Components can use `useContext(AuthContext)` to access login state. This approach is simpler for smaller apps and avoids installing Redux. It’s perfectly valid and often combined with `useReducer` to manage state transitions in a similar way to Redux but with less boilerplate.

Redux is more powerful especially if the app grows, provides devtools, and structure. Either approach can work. Given the advanced audience, demonstrating Redux usage is valuable, but they likely know context too.

> **Hooks and Custom Hooks:** We'll rely heavily on React hooks:

- `useState` for local component state.
- `useEffect` for side effects like data fetching on mount.
- `useContext` for context usage if any.
- `useDispatch` and `useSelector` for Redux hooks to interact with store.
- We might create **custom hooks** for repeated logic, e.g., a `useAuth()` hook that returns current user and login/logout handlers from context or Redux. Or a `useFetchDeals()` that triggers fetching and provides loading state.

Custom hooks allow extracting logic from components into reusable functions that still use hooks. For example:

```js
function useAuth() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const auth = useSelector((state) => state.auth);
  const login = (email, password) => {
    // call API to login, then dispatch loginSuccess
  };
  const logoutUser = () => {
    dispatch(logout());
  };
  return {
    user: auth.user,
    isAuthenticated: auth.isAuthenticated,
    login,
    logoutUser,
  };
}
```

This can simplify components by handling all auth logic inside the hook. We can similarly create `useDeals()` for deals state management.

Having set up the architecture of the React app, let's proceed to build the UI components and integrate the API.

### UI Components and Theming

We want our UI to be polished and responsive. We have two suggested approaches: **Material-UI (MUI)** or **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first CSS). We can even combine them or use one primarily.

**Material-UI Approach:** Using MUI (now @mui library) gives us a vast set of ready-made components (buttons, tables, dialogs, etc.) and a consistent design out-of-the-box following Google’s Material Design. It’s great for quickly building a professional looking interface. It also supports theming (so we can define primary/secondary colors, dark mode, etc.).

Install Material-UI:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material
```

We’ll use @emotion for styling (which MUI uses under the hood in v5).

**Tailwind CSS Approach:** Tailwind provides low-level utility classes to style elements with ease and responsive variants. It is very flexible but you build your own components with it (it doesn't provide ready-made modal or dropdown, etc., just the styling utilities for you to compose).

Using Tailwind might require setting up a PostCSS config. If using CRA, install:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then configure `tailwind.config.js` and include Tailwind directives in your CSS.

Given time, using Material-UI might get us faster results. We can also use a hybrid: for layout and spacing, Tailwind, but that could be overkill. Let’s choose **Material-UI** for this project, as it provides a full component set and good theming.

**Responsive Design:** We must ensure the app works on various screen sizes. MUI components are mostly responsive (e.g., the Grid system). Also, Tailwind utilities like `md:` allow breakpoints. We should design mobile-first: e.g., the deals list should stack items on small screens or turn into a simpler view, whereas on desktop show a table of deals.

Material-UI’s `<Grid>` and `<Box>` components and its style system allow easy responsiveness:

```jsx
<Grid container spacing={2}>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={8}>
    ... content ...
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={4}>
    ... sidebar ...
  </Grid>
</Grid>
```

This shows content full-width on mobile (xs) and split 8/4 on medium screens and up.

Tailwind example for responsive classes:

```jsx
<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
  <div className="md:w-2/3">Main content</div>
  <div className="md:w-1/3">Sidebar</div>
</div>
```

This uses Tailwind to stack on mobile (flex-col) and row on md+, with width fractions.

> **Responsive design built-in:** Tailwind includes responsive variants for each utility class, making mobile-friendly design straightforward ([Tailwind CSS vs. Material UI: Choosing the Right Styling Approach](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/choosing-between-tailwind-css-vs-material-ui#:~:text=%2A%20Utility,different%20breakpoints%20using%20simple%20class)). Material-UI offers breakpoints in its Grid and styling system as well, enabling designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

**Theming:** If we use MUI:
We can create a custom theme:

```jsx
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider } from "@mui/material/styles";

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: { main: "#1976d2" }, // blue for example
    secondary: { main: "#dc004e" }, // pinkish
  },
});
```

Then wrap our App (or at index.js) with `<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>`.

We can adjust typography, spacing etc., in theme if needed. This allows all MUI components (Button, AppBar, etc.) to use our chosen colors and style consistently.

If using Tailwind, we define styles via classes or extend in tailwind.config for custom colors.

**Component Design:**
We should identify what components we need:

- **Layout**: Possibly a navbar or header (with a Logout button and the app title).
- **DealsList** page: could show a table of deals. We might create `<DealsTable>` component or use MUI’s DataGrid or simple Table.
- **DealDetails** page: shows details of one deal and maybe notes, and allows editing/updating (if allowed).
- **DealForm** component: used in creating or editing a deal (fields for title, value, etc.)
- **Login** page: a form with email & password fields and login button.
- **ProtectedRoute** component: a wrapper for routes that checks if user is authenticated, if not, redirect to login. (In React Router v6, we can implement it by checking state in the element or using navigate).
- **Notification** component: to show success/error messages globally (maybe use a Snackbar from MUI or a Toast library like react-toastify for user feedback).

Let's implement a few key components:

**Navbar (Header):**

```jsx
import AppBar from "@mui/material/AppBar";
import Toolbar from "@mui/material/Toolbar";
import Typography from "@mui/material/Typography";
import Button from "@mui/material/Button";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { logout } from "../store/authSlice";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

function Header() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const isAuthenticated = useSelector((state) => state.auth.isAuthenticated);
  const user = useSelector((state) => state.auth.user);

  const handleLogout = () => {
    dispatch(logout());
    localStorage.removeItem("token");
    localStorage.removeItem("user");
    navigate("/login");
  };

  return (
    <AppBar position="static">
      <Toolbar>
        <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
          Deals Management
        </Typography>
        {isAuthenticated ? (
          <>
            <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginRight: 2 }}>
              Hello, {user?.name || user?.email}
            </Typography>
            <Button color="inherit" onClick={handleLogout}>
              Logout
            </Button>
          </>
        ) : (
          <Button color="inherit" onClick={() => navigate("/login")}>
            Login
          </Button>
        )}
      </Toolbar>
    </AppBar>
  );
}
export default Header;
```

This uses MUI AppBar and places a title and either a login or logout option. It shows a greeting with the user's name if logged in.

**Login Page:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { loginSuccess } from "../store/authSlice";
import axios from "axios";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { TextField, Button, Paper, Typography } from "@mui/material";

function Login() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setError(null);
    try {
      const res = await axios.post("/api/auth/login", { email, password });
      const token = res.data.token;
      // Optionally fetch user info here using token, or decode token if contains info
      // For now, just store email as user info
      const userInfo = { email };
      // Save to localStorage
      localStorage.setItem("token", token);
      localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(userInfo));
      dispatch(loginSuccess({ token, user: userInfo }));
      navigate("/deals");
    } catch (err) {
      setError("Invalid email or password");
    }
  };

  return (
    <Paper sx={{ maxWidth: 400, margin: "2rem auto", p: 2 }}>
      <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom>
        Login
      </Typography>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <TextField
          fullWidth
          label="Email"
          margin="normal"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
        />
        <TextField
          fullWidth
          label="Password"
          margin="normal"
          type="password"
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
        />
        {error && <Typography color="error">{error}</Typography>}
        <Button
          variant="contained"
          color="primary"
          type="submit"
          fullWidth
          sx={{ mt: 2 }}
        >
          Login
        </Button>
      </form>
    </Paper>
  );
}
export default Login;
```

This is a basic login form. On success, it stores token and user info and updates Redux state, then navigates to `/deals`. We catch error to display a message. The API call uses axios; note we assumed base URL is same domain for API (if our React dev server is on 3000 and API on 8080, we need a proxy or use full URL in dev).

**Axios Configuration:** It's helpful to set a default baseURL and interceptors:
In a `services/api.js`:

```js
import axios from "axios";
const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || "http://localhost:8080",
});
apiClient.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
apiClient.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response && error.response.status === 401) {
      // Handle token expiry - maybe redirect to login
      // dispatch logout etc.
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
export default apiClient;
```

This way, we don't have to attach the token manually for each request; the interceptor adds it. And we can globally handle 401 responses (e.g., navigate to login if token expired).

> **Axios interceptors** allow us to hook into requests/responses to inject auth headers and handle errors globally ([How to use Axios interceptors to handle API error responses - DEV Community](https://dev.to/darkmavis1980/how-to-use-axios-interceptors-to-handle-api-error-responses-2ij1#:~:text=With%20interceptors%20you%20can%20hook,modify%20the%20behaviours%20of%20them)) ([How to use Axios interceptors to handle API error responses - DEV Community](https://dev.to/darkmavis1980/how-to-use-axios-interceptors-to-handle-api-error-responses-2ij1#:~:text=axios.interceptors.response.use%28%20response%20%3D,window.location.href%20%3D)). For example, intercepting a 401 Unauthorized response can trigger a redirect to the login page automatically ([How to use Axios interceptors to handle API error responses - DEV Community](https://dev.to/darkmavis1980/how-to-use-axios-interceptors-to-handle-api-error-responses-2ij1#:~:text=axios.interceptors.response.use%28%20response%20%3D,window.location.href%20%3D)), ensuring a consistent error handling strategy across the app.

We can use `apiClient` instead of raw axios in our components and thunks.

**Deals List Page:**

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { fetchDeals } from "../store/dealsSlice";
import { CircularProgress, Typography, Button } from "@mui/material";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

function DealsList() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const deals = useSelector((state) => state.deals.list);
  const dealsStatus = useSelector((state) => state.deals.status);
  const error = useSelector((state) => state.deals.error);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (dealsStatus === "idle") {
      dispatch(fetchDeals());
    }
  }, [dealsStatus, dispatch]);

  const handleDealClick = (id) => {
    navigate(`/deals/${id}`);
  };

  if (dealsStatus === "loading") {
    return <CircularProgress />;
  }
  if (dealsStatus === "failed") {
    return <Typography color="error">Error: {error}</Typography>;
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: "1rem" }}>
      <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
        Deals
      </Typography>
      <Button
        variant="contained"
        color="primary"
        onClick={() => navigate("/deals/new")}
        sx={{ mb: 2 }}
      >
        New Deal
      </Button>
      {deals.length === 0 ? (
        <Typography>No deals found.</Typography>
      ) : (
        <table width="100%" border="1" cellPadding="8">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Title</th>
              <th>Owner</th>
              <th>Status</th>
              <th>Value</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            {deals.map((deal) => (
              <tr
                key={deal.id}
                onClick={() => handleDealClick(deal.id)}
                style={{ cursor: "pointer" }}
              >
                <td>{deal.title}</td>
                <td>{deal.owner ? deal.owner.name || deal.owner.email : ""}</td>
                <td>{deal.status}</td>
                <td>{deal.value}</td>
              </tr>
            ))}
          </tbody>
        </table>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
export default DealsList;
```

For simplicity, using an HTML table. We could use MUI’s `<Table>` components for better style. Each row clickable to go to detail page.

We trigger fetchDeals on first mount. This uses the Redux thunk we made, which calls the API and populates state.

**Deal Details / Edit Page:**
We might combine viewing and editing in one component:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useParams, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import apiClient from "../services/api";

function DealDetails() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [deal, setDeal] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [editing, setEditing] = useState(false);
  const [form, setForm] = useState({
    title: "",
    description: "",
    status: "",
    value: "",
  });
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadDeal = async () => {
      try {
        const res = await apiClient.get(`/api/deals/${id}`);
        setDeal(res.data);
        setForm({
          title: res.data.title,
          description: res.data.description || "",
          status: res.data.status,
          value: res.data.value,
        });
      } catch (err) {
        setError("Failed to load deal.");
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };
    if (id !== "new") {
      loadDeal();
    } else {
      // New deal creation mode
      setDeal({});
      setEditing(true);
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, [id]);

  const handleChange = (e) =>
    setForm({ ...form, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });

  const handleSave = async () => {
    try {
      if (id === "new") {
        await apiClient.post("/api/deals", form);
      } else {
        await apiClient.put(`/api/deals/${id}`, form);
      }
      navigate("/deals");
    } catch (err) {
      setError("Failed to save deal");
    }
  };

  const handleDelete = async () => {
    if (!window.confirm("Are you sure to delete this deal?")) return;
    try {
      await apiClient.delete(`/api/deals/${id}`);
      navigate("/deals");
    } catch (err) {
      setError("Failed to delete deal");
    }
  };

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p style={{ color: "red" }}>{error}</p>;

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: "1rem" }}>
      {editing ? (
        <div>
          <h2>{id === "new" ? "New Deal" : "Edit Deal"}</h2>
          <div>
            <label>
              Title:
              <input name="title" value={form.title} onChange={handleChange} />
            </label>

          <div>
            <label>

                value={form.description}
                onChange={handleChange}
              />
            </label>
          </div>
          <div>
            <label>
              Status:
              <select name="status" value={form.status} onChange={handleChange}>
                <option>NEW</option>
                <option>IN_PROGRESS</option>
                <option>WON</option>
                <option>LOST</option>
              </select>
            </label>
          </div>
          <div>
            <label>
              Value:
              <input
                type="number"
                name="value"
                value={form.value}
                onChange={handleChange}
              />
            </label>
          </div>
          <button onClick={handleSave}>Save</button>
          {id !== "new" && (
            <button onClick={() => setEditing(false)}>Cancel</button>
          )}
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div>
          <h2>Deal Details</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Title:</strong> {deal.title}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Description:</strong> {deal.description}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Status:</strong> {deal.status}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Value:</strong> {deal.value}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Owner:</strong> {deal.owner ? deal.owner.name : ""}
          </p>
          <button onClick={() => setEditing(true)}>Edit</button>
          <button
            onClick={handleDelete}
            style={{ color: "red", marginLeft: "1rem" }}
          >
            Delete
          </button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
export default DealDetails;
```

This component:

- If id is 'new', it's in create mode.
- If viewing existing, it fetches the deal and displays it.
- Edit mode allows changing fields (with simple inputs).
- Save triggers POST or PUT accordingly.
- Delete calls API and then navigates back to list.

We kept styling minimal here (straight HTML inputs). Ideally, use MUI `<TextField>` and `<Button>` here for consistency, but for brevity it's fine.

Note: The ability to edit status might be restricted on backend for non-admins (we didn't fully enforce that except in service logic). The UI could also hide or disable certain fields if user isn't admin. For example, if user not admin and not manager, maybe hide status dropdown or disallow deletion. We can get the current user role from Redux and conditionally render.

**Conditional UI based on Role:**
We have `user` and `roles` presumably stored in Redux. If not, we might need to fetch user details after login (or decode JWT if roles stored inside). Let's assume we at least know if current user is admin by either a flag in user info or checking roles from token.

We could do:

```jsx
const auth = useSelector((state) => state.auth);
const isAdmin = auth.user?.roles?.includes("ROLE_ADMIN");
```

If not stored, we might call an endpoint like `/api/users/me` after login to get user data including roles. But for now, skip.

Then in DealDetails, only show delete button if `isAdmin === true`:

```jsx
{
  isAdmin && <button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</button>;
}
```

This way, normal users don't even see a delete option.

Similarly, in DealsList, maybe only admins can see all deals. But our backend already filters, so normal user will only see theirs.

**Styling and polish:** We would normally refine visuals:

- Use MUI Card components to display deal details nicely.
- Use a modal or separate page for deal form.
- Add confirmations, success messages (like toast on successful save).
- Use proper spacing (MUI Box with margin/padding or CSS).
- Perhaps use `<Snackbar>` from MUI to show notifications (like using a Redux state for `alert` message and a component that shows Snackbar on state change).

Given length, we'll assume the UI is functional though not fully beautified.

**Responsive check:** The components should more or less be fine on small screens:

- The table might overflow on mobile; we'd possibly add CSS to allow scrolling.
- The forms and text likely okay.

We can test by resizing the browser or using dev tools device mode.

### API Integration (Axios, Authentication with JWT, Error Handling)

We already integrated **Axios** as our HTTP client and configured interceptors to attach JWT and handle errors globally. Let’s recap and add any additional details:

- We created `apiClient` with a base URL and Authorization header injection from localStorage. This ensures every API call automatically uses the current token.
- If the token is expired and API returns 401, our interceptor can catch it. In our example, we commented about dispatching logout on 401. We should implement that:
  In the interceptor error handler, we can:

  ```js
  if (error.response.status === 401) {
    localStorage.removeItem("token");
    localStorage.removeItem("user");
    // maybe redirect to login page. But we are outside React components here.
    // We could use window.location or better, a centralized event (like Redux store).
  }
  ```

  One trick: We can create a custom event emitter or use Redux in an interceptor by importing the store and dispatching. For instance:

  ```js
  import { store } from '../store';
  import { logout } from '../store/authSlice';
  ...
  if (error.response.status === 401) {
    store.dispatch(logout());
    // optionally redirect
    window.location.href = '/login';
  }
  ```

  This will log the user out in our app state if unauthorized.

- For general errors (like 500 from server or network down), we should show a friendly message. Possibly set an error state or use a toast.
- We added basic error handling in components (like setting error state when catch error). A more unified approach:
  Could use an error boundary for React (to catch rendering errors) and a global error context or Redux slice for API errors.
  But we can keep it simple: handle errors in each request as needed.

**Form validation on front-end:** To avoid sending bad data to API:

- We can use HTML5 required fields or add some checks (like title not empty, value >= 0).
- Use controlled components (which we did) and maybe show helper text if invalid.
- Possibly use a form library like Formik or React Hook Form for complex forms. For our simple form, not necessary.

**Environment configuration:** When building for production, the API base URL might differ (if backend deployed separately). CRA uses environment variables prefixed with `REACT_APP_` for runtime config.
We could set `REACT_APP_API_URL` and use it in apiClient baseURL. In development, we might set up a proxy in `package.json`:

```json
"proxy": "http://localhost:8080"
```

This way, any unknown requests (like `/api/deals`) from dev server will be forwarded to backend on 8080, avoiding CORS issues in dev. This is a CRA feature.

Alternatively, directly use full URL in axios (but then we need config for prod vs dev).

**CORS:** We must ensure the backend allows the frontend's origin. If dev is at http://localhost:3000, our Spring Boot should have configured CORS accordingly. E.g., in a SecurityConfig or a `@CrossOrigin(origins="http://localhost:3000")` on controllers, or a global CORS config:

```java
@Bean
public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
  return new WebMvcConfigurer() {
    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
      registry.addMapping("/api/**")
              .allowedOrigins("http://localhost:3000")
              .allowedMethods("GET","POST","PUT","DELETE");
    }
  };
}
```

This will allow our dev frontend to call the APIs. In production, if same domain or properly configured domain, adjust accordingly.

**JWT Storage and XSS concern:** Storing JWT in localStorage is common for SPA, but it can be susceptible to XSS if malicious script runs. An alternative is storing in an httpOnly cookie (then the browser sends it automatically, and you rely on server to check cookie). But that has CSRF considerations and is more complex for an API scenario. For an advanced system, one might implement refresh tokens in httpOnly cookies and short-lived access tokens in memory.

For our scope, localStorage is acceptable but mention:

- Always sanitize any dynamic content to avoid injecting scripts that could steal token from localStorage.
- Use Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS risks (the backend can send a CSP header).
- Consider rotating tokens regularly and using refresh pattern if scaling.

**Error handling UX:** We gave a few examples:

- In Login, we show "Invalid email or password" on 401.
- In DealsList, we show error message from state if fetch failed.
- We could also handle global errors with a central component that reads an error state and displays an alert.

One approach: a Redux slice for notifications:

```js
const notifySlice = createSlice({
  name: "notify",
  initialState: { message: null, type: null },
  reducers: {
    showSuccess: (state, action) => {
      state.message = action.payload;
      state.type = "success";
    },
    showError: (state, action) => {
      state.message = action.payload;
      state.type = "error";
    },
    clearMessage: (state) => {
      state.message = null;
      state.type = null;
    },
  },
});
```

Then dispatch `showError("Failed to load deals")` in catch. A Notification component subscribed to this state can show a Snackbar. On close, dispatch `clearMessage`.

Time constraints aside, this would be nice for real app.

### Performance Optimization (Frontend)

Front-end performance is vital for good UX. We will use several techniques:

- **Code Splitting:** We ensure that the bundle is split so that not all code is loaded upfront. With CRA and React Router, route-based splitting is easy using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
- **Lazy Loading:** We lazy load components that are not needed immediately (like maybe the DealDetails page can be loaded when user navigates to it).
- **Memoization:** Use `React.memo` for components that depend on props and don't need to re-render if props unchanged (especially lists of deals).
- **useMemo and useCallback:** For expensive calculations or to avoid re-creating functions on every render (which could trigger unnecessary child renders).
- **Optimizing re-renders:** For example, ensure our table rows have `key` and consider using `memo` on row component, etc.

**Code Splitting Example:** Instead of importing pages at top, do:

```jsx
const DealsList = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/DealsList'));
const DealDetails = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/DealDetails'));
...
<Routes>
  <Route path="/deals" element={
      <Suspense fallback={<CircularProgress />}>
         <DealsList />
      </Suspense>
  } />
  ...
</Routes>
```

This will create separate chunks for those pages, so initial load only gets the code for what's needed (maybe login page if user not logged in).

If using Redux, you might include it in main bundle always, but that's fine.

**Memoizing Components:** If we had a complex component that re-renders often with same props, wrap it in `React.memo`. For example, if we had a separate `DealRow` component:

```jsx
const DealRow = React.memo(({ deal, onClick }) => {
  console.log("rendering row", deal.id);
  return (
    <tr onClick={() => onClick(deal.id)}>
      <td>{deal.title}</td>...
    </tr>
  );
});
```

React.memo will skip re-rendering DealRow if `deal` prop and `onClick` prop are the same (by shallow comparison) as last time. This prevents re-rendering all rows if parent re-renders due to some state change that doesn't affect deal data.

In our case, when the deals list loaded, if none of the deals changed, and maybe a state like filter changed, we might not want to redraw all. It’s micro-optimization but can help if list is large.

**useCallback:** If we pass `handleDealClick` to many row components, ensure to wrap it:

```jsx
const handleDealClick = useCallback(
  (id) => {
    navigate(`/deals/${id}`);
  },
  [navigate]
);
```

So that the function reference doesn't change on every render (which would cause memoized rows to see prop change if a new function is passed each time).

**useMemo:** If we had expensive calculations (e.g., computing total value of deals, or sorting), we could useMemo to avoid recalculating on every render unless inputs (deals array) change.

**Avoid heavy computations in render:** If some operation is heavy (like parsing a large JSON, or filtering a big list), do it outside render if possible, or in useEffect with results in state, or useMemo.

**Virtualize long lists:** If the deals list can be extremely long (hundreds or thousands of entries), consider using a library like **react-window** or **react-virtualized** to only render visible items. For now, we'll assume the deals list is manageable (like maybe up to 50 or 100 visible at a time which is fine).

> - Use **virtualized lists** for rendering many items to improve rendering performance.
> - Leverage the React Developer Tools Profiler to spot performance bottlenecks, and optimize accordingly.

**Production Build:** Always build the app for production (`npm run build`) when deploying, which enables optimizations like minification and sets React to production mode for better performance and avoiding extra checks.

**Browser Caching:** Ensure static files (JS/CSS) are served with cache headers. CRA build outputs hashed filenames so caching is safe (if content changes, filename changes).

### Testing the Frontend (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress for E2E)

Just like the backend, the frontend needs testing:

- **Unit/Component Testing:** Using **Jest** (which comes with CRA) and **React Testing Library (RTL)** for testing components in isolation or with minimal context.
- **Integration/UI Testing:** Using **Cypress** for end-to-end tests simulating user behavior in a real browser environment.

#### Unit Testing with Jest and React Testing Library

React Testing Library (RTL) encourages testing components by interacting with them as a user would (finding elements by role or text, clicking, typing, etc.), rather than testing implementation details.

Examples:

- Test the Login component: render it with RTL, simulate user typing email and password, simulate form submit, and mock axios to return a token, then assert that `navigate` was called to '/deals'. We might need to use jest.mock for axios and react-router.

Let's illustrate a simple test for the Login component:

```jsx
// Login.test.js
import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from "@testing-library/react";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "../store";
import Login from "./Login";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import axios from "axios";

// Mock axios
jest.mock("axios");

test("renders login form and handles successful login", async () => {
  axios.post.mockResolvedValue({ data: { token: "fake-jwt-token" } });
  render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Login />
      </BrowserRouter>
    </Provider>
  );
  // Enter email and password
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText(/Email/i), {
    target: { value: "user@test.com" },
  });
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText(/Password/i), {
    target: { value: "pass123" },
  });
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: /Login/i }));
  // Wait for navigation or successful login indicator:
  await waitFor(() => {
    // The loginSuccess action will update state; perhaps the component redirects which unmounts it.
    // We can check that localStorage has token, indicating success
    expect(localStorage.getItem("token")).toBe("fake-jwt-token");
  });
});
```

This test uses a real Redux store; to avoid side effects on global store, we might use a dummy store or memory. Alternatively, mock the dispatch in the component. But this should work since store is in initial state.

We should also test an error scenario: mock axios to reject with 401, ensure error message appears on screen.

Testing a connected component like DealsList:

- We might need to set up initial state with some deals in store (maybe dispatch an action to set deals list) or mock the fetchDeals thunk (which would require mocking redux-thunk, or simply not call it by setting state manually).
- Or simpler: in test, we can intercept the network call by mocking axios.get and then maybe calling dispatch fetchDeals.

This gets complex; an alternate approach is to test components in isolation with context or stub data:
For DealsList, rather than relying on Redux thunk, simulate it:

```jsx
axios.get.mockResolvedValue({
  data: [
    { id: 1, title: "X", status: "NEW", owner: { email: "a" }, value: 100 },
  ],
});
// ... render DealsList wrapped in Provider
// then wait for table row to show up with title 'X'
```

But we need to dispatch fetchDeals, which triggers axios via thunk. Actually, if we don't want to test Redux integration here, we can test simpler:
Call `store.dispatch(fetchDeals())` in test after mocking axios, then verify store state updated.

RTL can also test presence of certain elements:

- Check that clicking a row navigates to detail page. That is tricky without a router context; we might use MemoryRouter and check the URL or use a spy on navigate function. Possibly better to test that on an e2e level with Cypress.

**Cypress End-to-End Testing:**

Cypress runs a real (headless or visible) browser to test the fully running application. We can simulate a user going through login, viewing deals, etc., with the actual frontend and backend if needed, or by stubbing network calls.

Setting up Cypress:

```
npm install cypress --save-dev
npx cypress open
```

This opens Cypress UI where we can write tests under `cypress/integration` folder.

E.g., `cypress/integration/deals_spec.js`:

```js
describe("Deals Management App", () => {
  it("should allow a user to log in and view their deals", () => {
    // Assuming backend is running at localhost:8080 and app at localhost:3000
    cy.visit("http://localhost:3000/login");
    cy.get('input[name="email"]').type("user@test.com");
    cy.get('input[name="password"]').type("password123");
    cy.get("button").contains("Login").click();
    // after login, it should navigate to /deals
    cy.url().should("include", "/deals");
    // should display deals list or "No deals" message
    cy.contains("Deals");
    // Perhaps create a deal
    cy.contains("New Deal").click();
    cy.url().should("include", "/deals/new");
    // Fill new deal form
    cy.get('input[name="title"]').type("Test Deal Cypress");
    cy.get('input[name="value"]').type("1000");
    cy.get('select[name="status"]').select("NEW");
    cy.get("button").contains("Save").click();
    // On success, back to /deals and see the new deal
    cy.url().should("include", "/deals");
    cy.contains("Test Deal Cypress"); // verify the title appears in list
  });
});
```

This test goes through the actual app. We must have a known user (user@test.com) in the database with password password123. We could create that user via an API call in a `before` hook or assume DB is seeded.

Cypress can also stub network calls using `cy.intercept` to not rely on real backend (which would make it more of a frontend test only). But having it run with real backend is closer to e2e.

We could also test an admin flow where admin sees all deals, deletes one, etc.

Cypress tests can be integrated into CI (running headless with `cypress run`).

**Running tests in CI**:

- Unit tests (Jest) can run with `npm test -- --watchAll=false`.
- Cypress can run with `npx cypress run` (assuming application and backend are up or using `start-server-and-test` to start them before running tests).
- Alternatively, use React Testing Library for integration style tests, but Cypress gives a higher confidence by testing in a browser.

**Best practices for tests:**

- Keep tests **independent** (state reset for each, avoid one test depending on results of another) ([Testing React Applications with Cypress: A Comprehensive Guide - DEV Community](https://dev.to/aswani25/testing-react-applications-with-cypress-a-comprehensive-guide-4fhl#:~:text=Best%20Practices%20for%20Testing%20React,Applications%20with%20Cypress)).
- Use test IDs or accessible text for selecting elements, not CSS selectors that are brittle. (We used labels and button text which is good).
- Clean up after tests (like if creating data via API, delete it, or use a test database).
- Use CI to run tests on every commit/PR to catch issues early ([Testing React Applications with Cypress: A Comprehensive Guide - DEV Community](https://dev.to/aswani25/testing-react-applications-with-cypress-a-comprehensive-guide-4fhl#:~:text=3,pipeline%20to%20catch%20issues%20early)).

Testing ensures that as we proceed to deployment, we have confidence in both backend and frontend functionality.

---

## Deploying & Scaling

Now that development is complete, we need to **deploy** the Deals Management System to a production environment and plan for scale. This chapter covers setting up a CI/CD pipeline, containerizing the app, deploying to cloud providers (AWS/GCP/Azure), configuring load balancing and auto-scaling for high availability, and implementing security best practices in production (HTTPS, environment security, etc.).

### CI/CD Pipeline Automation

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) will automate building, testing, and deploying our application. We want every code change to be quickly integrated and deployed in a reliable way.

**Version Control:** We assume the code is in a Git repository (maybe on GitHub or GitLab). The CI pipeline will be triggered on pushes or PRs to certain branches.

**GitHub Actions Example:** If using GitHub, we can create a workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI-CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      mysql:
        image: mysql:8.0
        env:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
          MYSQL_DATABASE: deals_db_test
        ports: ["3306:3306"]
        options: --health-cmd="mysqladmin ping -h localhost" --health-interval=10s --health-timeout=5s --health-retries=3
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: "temurin"
          java-version: "17"
      - name: BackEnd - Build and Test
        working-directory: backend/
        run: mvn verify # builds and runs tests
      - name: FrontEnd - Install and Test
        working-directory: frontend/
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build
          npm test -- --watchAll=false

  dockerize-and-deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build Docker images
        run: |
          docker build -t myrepo/deals-backend:latest ./backend
          docker build -t myrepo/deals-frontend:latest ./frontend
      - name: Push Docker images
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u "${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin
          docker push myrepo/deals-backend:latest
          docker push myrepo/deals-frontend:latest
      - name: Deploy to Server
        run: |
          ssh user@server "docker pull myrepo/deals-backend:latest && docker pull myrepo/deals-frontend:latest && docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml up -d"
```

This is a rough example:

- It runs tests in parallel (one job or sequential).
- If tests pass, it builds Docker images for backend and frontend, pushes them to Docker Hub (myrepo) or a container registry.
- Then possibly SSH into a server to deploy (or trigger AWS/GCP deploy).

Alternatively, we might use a specific deploy action if deploying to Kubernetes or a PaaS:

- For AWS, use AWS CLI to update ECS service or Elastic Beanstalk.
- For Kubernetes, apply new manifests or use ArgoCD, etc.

If using **Jenkins**:

- We create a Jenkinsfile with stages: Checkout, Build Backend, Test Backend, Build Frontend, Test Frontend, Build Docker, Deploy.
- Jenkins can archive artifacts (like the JAR or static files) or directly build images.

**Dockerization:**
We need Dockerfiles:

- Backend Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/deals-management.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Dspring.profiles.active=prod","-jar","app.jar"]
```

Assuming we package jar via `mvn package`. We likely use Spring profile "prod" for production props (like different DB or secrets).

- Frontend Dockerfile (to serve built static files via Nginx):

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY deploy/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

Where `deploy/nginx.conf` configures Nginx to serve static files and perhaps handle client-side routing (i.e., redirect all to index.html except known file routes).

Alternatively, one could use a multi-stage Dockerfile in the backend to copy static build into a Spring Boot jar if it served static (but we kept them separate).

**Docker Compose (Production):**
We could use Docker Compose to run both containers and a MySQL:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  backend:
    image: myrepo/deals-backend:latest
    env_file: .env # contains DB URL, user, pass, JWT secret maybe
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
  frontend:
    image: myrepo/deals-frontend:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=${DB_NAME}
      - MYSQL_USER=${DB_USER}
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db_data:
```

This would spin up backend, frontend (Nginx serving React), and database on a single VM. That might be fine for smaller scale. For larger, we might use managed DB.

**Cloud Deployment Options:**

- **AWS:** There are many ways:
  - **EC2:** Launch an EC2 VM, install Docker, run docker-compose as above. Or use an auto-scaling group of EC2s with a load balancer.
  - **Elastic Beanstalk:** Can deploy both as a multi-container app (Dockerrun file with both containers).
  - **ECS (Elastic Container Service):** Deploy containers on a cluster; define a Task Definition with both containers and use an Application Load Balancer for front/back (maybe serve frontend via S3+CloudFront instead).
  - **EKS (Kubernetes on AWS):** More complex but scalable; deploy pods for backend and maybe serve frontend static from S3 or a Nginx pod. Use ALB Ingress for routing.
  - **AWS RDS:** Use RDS MySQL for production DB (rather than a containerized MySQL which isn't highly available).
- **GCP:** GKE for Kubernetes, or Cloud Run (could run backend container on Cloud Run, frontend static on Firebase Hosting or Cloud Storage).
- **Azure:** Similar with Azure App Service for containers or AKS for K8s.

Given a typical scenario, one could use:
**AWS Example:** Use **Elastic Beanstalk** for simplicity:

- EB can handle a Java backend easily by deploying the jar. But for React, we'd serve separately. Instead, we use EB's Docker support for multi-container:
  - Use `eb init` etc., provide a Dockerrun.aws.json or use Docker Compose with EB.
  - EB will set up EC2 with Docker, ALB, Auto-scaling out of the box.

**Kubernetes Example (for advanced):** If we had more time:

- Write k8s manifests: a Deployment for backend, a Service for it, a Deployment for frontend (nginx), a Service for it, an Ingress to route or two ingresses / different subdomains.
- Possibly use Helm or Kustomize for manage config. Then GitOps to manage cluster state.

Given the audience, they likely are aware of these but expecting mention:

> To ensure reliability and scalability, deploy the application in a container orchestration platform. For example, using Kubernetes allows you to easily scale out the backend by adding replicas and use a LoadBalancer or Ingress to distribute requests across them.

**Auto-scaling and Load Balancing:**

- **Load Balancer:** If frontend and backend on same domain, the LB could route by path (`/api/` goes to backend service on 8080, others to frontend on 80). In simpler setup, might not need path-based because frontend can call backend directly by service name if internal or via public API.
- In our Docker Compose, the front calls backend via `http://localhost:8080`. In production, if separate, front could call via `/api/*` where Nginx is configured to proxy to backend container, or use a config variable for the API endpoint.

Auto-scaling strategies:

- If using Kubernetes: configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for backend deployment based on CPU or request throughput.
- If using AWS ECS: set up Service Auto Scaling to add tasks on high CPU.
- If using EC2/ELB: configure Auto Scaling Group to launch more EC2 instances when CPU/network is high.

For database scaling:

- Use read replicas for heavy read scenarios, or a more scaled DB cluster.
- Possibly move to a distributed cache (Redis) for caching heavy read data to reduce DB load.

**CI/CD Continued:** We should ensure CI/CD also covers:

- Running security checks (like dependency vulnerability scan e.g. `mvn dependency:check` or use Snyk).
- Code quality and linting (ESLint for frontend in CI, maybe SonarQube analysis for backend).
- Running tests on each pull request and not deploying unless tests pass.

> **Production CI/CD Benefits:** A CI/CD pipeline automates build, test, and deployment, ensuring that new changes go through all tests and quality checks before hitting production. This reduces the chance of human error in the deployment process and enables rapid, reliable releases ([What are some essential things in the production grade CI/CD ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/zdd4lv/what_are_some_essential_things_in_the_production/#:~:text=,that%20must%20be%20included)).

With our pipeline and deployment plan, we can get the app up and running in the cloud.

### Deployment and Hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure)

Let's focus on AWS as a concrete example since it's commonly used:

- We choose to containerize and use **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)** with Fargate (serverless containers).
- We push images to **Amazon ECR** (Elastic Container Registry).
- Create an **ECS Cluster** and define a Task Definition for the backend container and one for frontend or possibly run them separately. Perhaps easier: serve frontend on S3 and CloudFront, backend on ECS Service.

**Option: Serve Frontend via S3/CloudFront**:

- Build the React app (`npm run build`), upload contents of `build/` directory to an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.
- Use CloudFront CDN in front of that S3 for global distribution and TLS.
- This decouples front from back.
- The React app will call the backend via an API endpoint (e.g., using a config like `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.myapp.com`).
- In AWS, we can have API.myapp.com pointing to an Application Load Balancer which forwards to ECS service running Spring Boot.

**Option: Both on ECS**:

- The front container (nginx) and backend container could run in one task (but that ties scaling together).
- Better to have separate tasks/services: one for back (expose port 8080), one for front (port 80).
- Use an ALB with two target groups and path-based routing: `/*` -> frontend service, `/api/*` -> backend service. This way one ALB and one domain can serve both. The ALB listens on 80/443.

**AWS Networking & Domain:**

- Use Route53 to point your domain to the CloudFront (for static) or ALB (if using that).
- Ensure TLS certificate via AWS Certificate Manager for domain (free).

**Database on AWS:**

- Use Amazon RDS MySQL. It provides automated backups, multi-AZ failover for reliability.
- You would configure the Spring Boot app with the RDS endpoint and credentials (provided via environment variables or secrets manager).

**Environment Variables and Secrets:**

- Do not bake secrets into images. Use env variables in ECS task definition or via AWS Secrets Manager integration.
- For example, in ECS you can refer to secrets to set SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD, JWT signing key if using a fixed secret, etc.
- Similarly, for any third-party API keys if integrated.

**Logging and Monitoring in Cloud:**

- Ensure container logs (stdout) are sent to CloudWatch Logs (ECS can do that).
- Set up CloudWatch Alarms for high error rates or high latency (if using X-Ray or custom metrics).
- Use Application Load Balancer's access logs or CloudFront logs to monitor traffic.

**Auto-Scaling in ECS:**

- Use Service Auto Scaling: define scaling policies, e.g., target CPU 50%, min 2 tasks, max 10 tasks.
- ALB will distribute traffic to tasks. If tasks are in multiple AZs, ALB covers multi-AZ high availability.

**Azure/GCP analogues:**

- Azure: Could use Azure App Service (Web App for Containers) for each container, or AKS (Kubernetes), or Azure Container Instances for small usage. Azure MySQL for DB.
- GCP: Cloud Run for backend is nice (scale to 0 when no traffic), and Firebase Hosting for frontend or Cloud Storage as static. GCP Cloud SQL for MySQL.

Each platform has similar components:
the key is the app is containerized and stateless, so it can run on any.

**Dockers on a single VM vs orchestrated:**
For small scale startup project, deploying via docker-compose on a single VM might be enough (and cheaper). But that is a single point of failure and manual scaling.

Using managed services (ECS, EKS, etc.) adds complexity but yields better availability and scaling.

**Scaling Database:**

- Typically scale up (bigger instance) or read replicas. Write scaling for MySQL can involve sharding or switching to a cluster or NoSQL if needed. Out of scope for now, just note that DB can be a bottleneck if traffic high. Use caching or optimize queries accordingly.

**Content Delivery:**

- If global users, use a CDN (CloudFront, etc.) for static content.
- Possibly also consider caching API responses at edge if appropriate (like public data).
- Use GZIP compression on server (Spring Boot can be configured to compress responses, or let ALB/CloudFront do it).

**Cost considerations:**

- If budget is a concern, one might use a single droplet (DigitalOcean) or small EC2.
- Containerization still helpful for consistency.
- Alternatively, use Heroku or Render or other PaaS to host both front and back easily.
- The guide is advanced, so likely targeting more scalable infra.

### Security Best Practices in Production

Security must be tightened in production. Here we compile best practices specifically for deployment:

1. **Use HTTPS Everywhere:** All client-server communication must be encrypted with TLS. Obtain certificates (via Let's Encrypt or cloud provider) and configure them on the load balancer or server ([10 Excellent Ways to Secure Your Spring Boot Application | Okta Developer](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/30/10-ways-to-secure-spring-boot#:~:text=1)). Our domain (e.g., myapp.com and api.myapp.com) should force HTTPS. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and protects tokens and data in transit.
   > “Use HTTPS in Production” – TLS ensures privacy and data integrity in transit ([10 Excellent Ways to Secure Your Spring Boot Application | Okta Developer](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/30/10-ways-to-secure-spring-boot#:~:text=1)). With free CAs like Let’s Encrypt, there’s no excuse to not use HTTPS on all endpoints.
2. **Secure Cookies (if any):** If we were using cookies for JWT or session, mark them HttpOnly and Secure. In our case, we use localStorage for JWT, so ensure the application is served over HTTPS and implement other XSS mitigations.

3. **Environment & Secret Management:** Never commit secrets to code. Use environment variables or secret stores for:

   - Database credentials
   - JWT signing secret or keys
   - Third-party API keys
     These should not be visible in client-side code. Only embed what’s necessary on client (which is mostly API URLs, etc., not secrets).

4. **CORS and Allowed Origins:** Configure the backend to only accept requests from the known frontend origin in production. For instance, if front is served at `https://app.mycompany.com`, then the API CORS allowed origin is that URL, not `*`. This prevents other domains from calling your API using a user's token (if someone somehow got token or user is tricked into visiting malicious site that attempts calls).
   Spring Boot CORS config we did should be adjusted for prod domain.
5. **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Set a CSP header on the frontend (and possibly on backend for its responses too). For example, restrict script sources to only our domain and trusted CDNs. This helps mitigate XSS by disallowing rogue scripts ([10 Excellent Ways to Secure Your Spring Boot Application | Okta Developer](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/30/10-ways-to-secure-spring-boot#:~:text=5,Policy%20to%20Prevent%20XSS%20Attacks)).
   Example CSP:

   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'sha256-abc...'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none';
   ```

   It's complex to configure but worth it.

6. **XSS and Sanitization:** React is generally safe by escaping content. Just ensure we don't dangerously set HTML with untrusted data. If we did, we must sanitize it.
   Also, for backend, if it returns any data that might have HTML in it (like if deals had a description with HTML), ensure the frontend treats it safely. It's best to treat all data as untrusted and not execute it.

7. **SQL Injection:** Using JPA and parameterized queries inherently protects against injection (no string concatenation for queries, but if any custom query uses user input, always use parameters). We should double-check any native queries (none here) or `EntityManager.createQuery` usages to not concatenate user input.

8. **Validation:** On backend, validate inputs (using Bean Validation on DTOs or manual checks) to avoid invalid data or potential logic bypass. E.g., when updating a deal, ensure status is one of allowed values (could use an enum). We did some of that in code.

9. **Authentication & Authorization:** Our JWT approach should be robust:

   - Use a strong secret key (or RSA key pair) for signing JWT. The `JwtTokenProvider` example used a random key each run (not good for prod). We should use a fixed secret from env. Also prefer HS256 with a sufficiently long secret or RS256 with a key pair.
   - Set appropriate JWT expiration (we did 1 hour). Consider using refresh tokens to let users remain logged in without risk of long-lived tokens. The refresh token would be httpOnly cookie or stored securely.
   - Implement token revocation if needed (e.g., ability to invalidate a token when user logs out or password changes, perhaps by keeping a token blacklist or changing a token version in user record).
   - Ensure password hashing is strong (BCrypt with proper strength, which by default is 10 rounds; can increase to 12).
   - Possibly enforce password policies (min length, complexity) and multi-factor auth for admin accounts if high security environment.

10. **Rate Limiting:** Protect the API from brute-force or DDoS attacks:

    - Use a rate limiter on sensitive endpoints like login (to prevent brute forcing passwords) and maybe on general API calls to prevent abuse. Could implement in Spring Boot using a filter or use a proxy (like Nginx or API Gateway) that has rate limiting.
    - For example, only allow 5 login attempts per minute per IP, etc., and temporarily block if exceeded.
      Rate limiting is often done at the gateway or load balancer level (e.g., AWS API Gateway can set that, or use Cloudflare in front).
      > Rate limiting ensures an API cannot be spammed with requests beyond a threshold, which helps prevent abuse and maintain availability ([Everything You Need to Know About Rate Limiting for APIs - Medium](https://medium.com/@bijit211987/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rate-limiting-for-apis-f236d2adcfff#:~:text=One%20common%20approach%20is%20to,a%20minute%20or%20an)).
      > A simple approach in Spring could use Bucket4j library for in-memory rate limiting or use Redis to track counts.

11. **OWASP Top 10 Awareness:** Our app touches several OWASP Top 10 categories:

    - Injection (SQLi) – mitigated by using JPA and prepared statements.
    - Broken Auth – using JWT with proper validation.
    - Sensitive Data Exposure – using HTTPS, not exposing secrets.
    - XML External Entities (XXE) – not applicable unless we parse XML, which we don't.
    - Broken Access Control – we implemented RBAC, ensure no endpoints left unprotected (e.g., we should double-check any endpoint mapping we might have missed securing).
    - Security Misconfiguration – ensure default accounts or unnecessary services are disabled (e.g., did we leave H2 console open? We didn't use one. Make sure Actuator endpoints are secured or not publicly accessible, especially shutdown or env endpoints).
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – CSP and React escaping helps.
    - Insecure Deserialization – not applicable unless we accept serialized objects from user.
    - Using Components with Known Vulns – keep dependencies updated and do a scan (Spring Boot and React deps should be updated regularly).
    - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring – ensure we log important security events (e.g., logins, failed logins, errors) and that logs are monitored/alerted.

12. **Server Security:**

    - If managing our own server/EC2: keep it updated, use ufw/iptables to only allow needed ports (e.g., 80/443, maybe 22 for SSH restricted to our IP).
    - Use IAM roles for any cloud resources rather than embedding credentials.
    - Backup the database regularly. For RDS configure snapshots.
    - Have a disaster recovery plan (in case data loss or server down).

13. **Penetration Testing:** After deployment, consider running a tool like **OWASP ZAP** against the app to catch any obvious holes ([10 Excellent Ways to Secure Your Spring Boot Application | Okta Developer](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/30/10-ways-to-secure-spring-boot#:~:text=9,OWASP%E2%80%99s%20ZAP)). Also, code review from security experts if possible ([10 Excellent Ways to Secure Your Spring Boot Application | Okta Developer](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/30/10-ways-to-secure-spring-boot#:~:text=10,do%20a%20Code%20Review)).

14. **Monitoring:** (Though covered in next section, it's security too) – Set up alerts for unusual activities, like multiple login failures (could indicate an attack).

By following these practices, we greatly reduce the risk of a security incident. As the saying goes, security is a process, not a product – so continually update and review security measures as the application evolves.

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

Even with careful development, issues will arise. This chapter focuses on debugging techniques, common issues and their fixes, and setting up monitoring to catch problems early. We also discuss logging practices and tools (like ELK stack, Prometheus, Grafana) to help troubleshoot and monitor the system in production.

### Common Issues & Fixes

**During Development:**

- **CORS errors (Origin not allowed):** This happens when the frontend (running on localhost:3000) tries to call backend (localhost:8080) and the backend isn't configured to allow it. The fix is enabling CORS on the backend for that origin ([8 Common Mistakes in React and Spring Boot Projects – academicnesthub](https://academicnesthub.wordpress.com/2024/12/11/8-common-mistakes-in-react-and-spring-boot-projects/#:~:text=Solution%3A)) or using a proxy. We addressed this by adding CORS config in Spring Boot for development. In production, if everything is on the same domain or properly configured, it should go away. If using different subdomains, ensure CORS config covers it or use a gateway.
- **Database connection issues:** e.g., MySQL "Connection refused" or "Unknown database":
  - Ensure MySQL is running and credentials are correct.
  - If using Docker, make sure the network is set up (for example, if backend container starts before DB container, could fail; using depends_on in compose or retry logic can help).
  - Check JDBC URL syntax (e.g., `jdbc:mysql://dbhost:3306/deals_db`). Also ensure the MySQL driver dependency is present (we added).
- **LazyInitializationException:** In Hibernate, if we try to access a lazy-loaded relationship outside of a transaction. For instance, if `Deal.owner` was LAZY and we didn't fetch it in the service, and the controller tries `deal.getOwner().getName()` after transaction closed, we'd get this error. Solutions: either use EAGER fetch for needed relations or use `@Transactional` on controller (not recommended) or ensure the service fetches all needed data within transaction (using join fetch or explicitly calling something like `deal.getOwner()` within the service so it's loaded).
  We set ManyToOne as default EAGER so likely not an issue for owner. If we had a lazy collection (like `deal.notes`), to use it we must fetch or iterate in service.
- **Incorrect URL mapping / 404 errors:** If a frontend route doesn't exist in backend, or vice versa. For instance, you try to open `http://localhost:8080/deals` in browser and get 404 because our API is under `/api/deals`. Or if the React Router isn't configured to handle a path, you might get a blank page or 404 from server if hard refreshing on a route (for that, one must configure the server to serve index.html for all unknown paths except API).
  The fix for refresh 404 on frontend if served by Nginx is to add `try_files $uri /index.html` in config, so it serves index.html for any route that isn't a real file.
- **State management bugs:** e.g., forgetting to clear state on logout (user still sees old data), or dealing with stale state if not updating store after an action. Fix by proper Redux flow or resetting store on logout (some do a root reducer that wipes state on logout action).
- **One common mistake** in React+Spring projects: not separating config for dev/prod, leading to code calling `http://localhost:8080` in production (which obviously fails). Always externalize such URLs (like using `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`). We must verify that in our built app, the API calls indeed go to the correct endpoint.

**During Build/Integration:**

- **Maven build failure due to tests:** A test might fail on CI but works locally, possibly due to environment differences (e.g., tests expecting a local MySQL). Use an in-memory DB for tests (H2) or ensure CI provides a DB. We showed using MySQL service in GitHub Actions, but an alternative is using H2 for tests by adding dependency and setting profile for tests.
- **Docker build issues:** e.g., large image size or build cache not updating.
  - Use `.dockerignore` to avoid copying unnecessary files (like node_modules, test reports).
  - If using multi-stage, ensure the final stage has minimal layers.
- **Container not starting:** Check logs. If Spring Boot container fails, logs will show if, say, the DB connection failed or a port conflict.
  - Use `docker logs <container>` to see error. Common error: "Failed to configure DataSource" means it couldn't connect to DB.
  - Another: "PORT already in use": if our container tries 8080 but something else on host uses 8080. Adjust mapping or free the port.
- **Frontend build issues:** sometimes production build might reveal issues (like environment variable missing, or an import error that was case-sensitive on Linux but not on Windows). Check the build output/logs carefully. Fix path cases, ensure env variables are set in CI for build.

**Runtime Issues in Production:**

- **Memory Leaks or OutOfMemory:** If memory usage grows over time:
  - Analyze if we store too much in memory (cache too large, or not releasing resources).
  - Java: use monitoring (JVM metrics) and profiling tools. Maybe increase heap if needed but better to find leak.
  - Common cause: large result sets kept in memory, or infinite recursion, or not closing resources. For us, using JPA should be fine; no manual memory management needed.
  - Frontend memory leak: often from components not properly un-subscribing (not a big concern with our simple app, but if using timers or subscriptions, useEffect cleanup).
- **High CPU usage:** e.g., inefficient queries causing high DB CPU or too frequent polling.
  - Check if any uncached frequent call can be reduced or cached.
  - Use APM (Application Performance Monitoring) like New Relic, or at least examine logs for slow queries (Hibernate can log slow query times if configured).
  - Optimize any identified slow part (maybe an N+1 query, missing index).
- **Networking issues:** If behind a proxy, might get issues like X-Forwarded-For not handled, or the app building absolute URLs incorrectly (we didn't do that).
  - If using proxies, ensure they forward necessary headers (like for security, e.g., if using Spring Security with OIDC or something, behind LB might need `X-Forwarded-Proto` to avoid issues with redirect URIs).
  - Cross-check backend URL in front-end config.

**RBAC Mistakes:**

- A common bug is forgetting to secure an endpoint (like leaving a URL unprotected). We should test that unauthorized access is indeed blocked. Possibly with a tool or manually:
  - Try calling a deals API without token, expecting 401.
  - Try with a normal user token to access an admin endpoint (like delete others' deals) and expect 403.
    If any hole, fix by adding security rules.

**Common front-end issues:**

- **White screen / app not loading in production:** Could be due to an unhandled error or something like incorrect base path.
  - Check browser console for errors (like "Uncaught TypeError" etc.).
  - Possibly the API URL is wrong and causing uncaught promise rejections. We should handle promise rejections (e.g., in our axios calls we mostly catch).
  - Could be missing environment config (if API URL undefined, axios might call wrong place).
  - Use source maps or error logging (Sentry etc.) in front-end to get error context.
- **Login redirect loop or staying logged out:** Might be misconfigured logic checking auth. E.g., if token exists but our app didn't use it properly, user might be stuck at login even with a token.
  - Check Redux state or context at startup: We set initial token from localStorage. If forgot that, app would treat logged in user as logged out until they manually login again. We did handle initialState from localStorage, so should be fine.

**Fixing Issues:**

- Use logs heavily. For the backend, keep logging at INFO for normal operations, DEBUG if needed (but off in prod because verbose). Use WARN/ERROR for issues.
- Implement a global error handler in Spring (`@ControllerAdvice`) to catch exceptions (like ResourceNotFound) and return JSON with error message. This avoids stack traces reaching user and gives a cleaner error response.
- For React, consider an Error Boundary component to catch render errors and display a friendly message (and maybe report error).

**Spring Boot Actuator (for debugging/monitoring):**

- We could include `spring-boot-starter-actuator` to have endpoints like `/actuator/health` (useful for load balancers to check health), `/actuator/metrics` (exposing metrics we can use).
- Security: protect these endpoints or expose only needed ones.
- Actuator can integrate with Prometheus via `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint if micrometer is configured with Prom. We'll cover that soon.

### Monitoring & Logging (ELK, Prometheus, Grafana)

To maintain the system, we need good logging and monitoring:

- **Logging (ELK Stack):** ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana. Combined with Beats (like Filebeat) it forms a pipeline to aggregate logs.

  - Each instance/container writes logs (our backend logs to stdout or a file).
  - Filebeat (an agent) can be installed to tail log files or read Docker logs and ship to Logstash or directly to Elasticsearch.
  - Logstash can process logs (parse timestamps, etc.) and then store in Elasticsearch.
  - Kibana provides a UI to query and visualize logs.

  For our Docker setup, a simpler route:

  - Use AWS CloudWatch Logs or another cloud logger (like Datadog).
  - But if self-managed: run an ELK stack (Elastic provides a stack).

  We could run ELK via Docker too, but that's heavy. Often in prod, use a managed service for logs to avoid overhead.

  The goal is that when something goes wrong, we can search the logs across all instances easily by time, error message, user id, etc.

  Setup example:

  - Use Filebeat in each container or as a sidecar to send logs.
  - Or configure Spring Boot to log in JSON and send directly to Elasticsearch (some appenders can do that).

  On Kubernetes, one often uses EFK (Fluentd instead of Logstash) or a cloud logging.

  Since a full ELK config is complex, we just note:

  > Aggregating logs with a centralized system like ELK allows us to search and analyze logs from all services in one place, which is crucial for debugging issues in a distributed environment ([GitHub - ivangfr/springboot-elk-prometheus-grafana: The goal of this project is to implement a Spring Boot application, called movies-api, and use Filebeat & ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) to collect and visualize application's logs and Prometheus & Grafana to monitor application's metrics.](https://github.com/ivangfr/springboot-elk-prometheus-grafana#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20this%20project,Grafana%20to%20monitor%20application%27s%20metrics)).

  Logging best practices:

  - Include contextual info: e.g., log the user ID or deal ID in logs when processing a request, to trace a particular flow. In Spring, you can use Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC) to add request-specific data (like a request ID).
  - Ensure exceptions are logged with stack trace in server logs (so we can debug code issues).
  - Use log rotation to avoid filling disk if writing to files.

- **Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana):**

  - **Prometheus** is an open-source monitoring system that scrapes metrics from services. Spring Boot Actuator can expose metrics (like memory, CPU, request counts, response times, DB pool stats, etc.) in a Prometheus format.
  - **Micrometer** is included in Spring Boot Actuator that provides these metrics in a vendor-neutral way.
  - We could add dependency `micrometer-registry-prometheus` and then actuator will have `/actuator/prometheus`.
  - Deploy Prometheus server to scrape the backend at that endpoint. Also, Node Exporter or cAdvisor to get container/host metrics.
  - Then **Grafana** to visualize metrics: create dashboards for:
    - JVM memory and garbage collection
    - CPU usage
    - Requests per second, error rate (perhaps from an HTTP server metric)
    - Custom business metrics (we could instrument e.g., number of deals created, etc.)
    - Database metrics (if available, or at least use CloudWatch for RDS).

  Grafana can also alert based on Prometheus data (like alert if error rate > X or if no heartbeats).

  For front-end, you can track performance metrics (like First Paint, etc.) via tools or send custom events to GA or a monitoring service. Not critical in an internal app but could be done.

  Also consider **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)** tools:

  - e.g., New Relic, Datadog APM, or Zipkin for distributed tracing. These can trace requests through the system (useful if microservices architecture).
  - For single service, not as needed, but could still give method-level performance insight.

  Another is **ELK for metrics**:

  - Alternatively, use Beats (Metricbeat) to send system metrics to Elasticsearch, and use Kibana for monitoring. But Prom/Grafana is more common for time-series metrics.

  **Alerting & Notifications:**

  - Set up alerts for key events:
    - High error rates (if say >5% of requests are errors in last 5 min, alert dev team).
    - Downtime (if service health check fails).
    - High latency (95th percentile response time goes above threshold).
    - High DB CPU or nearly full disk, etc.

  These alerts can be via email, SMS, Slack, etc. Grafana or cloud monitoring services can handle that.

  For example, using Grafana Alerting or Prometheus Alertmanager to send to Slack:

  > Integrating with monitoring tools, you can set up alerts so that if any service goes down or exhibits unusual behavior, the team is notified immediately (e.g., Slack or email notifications).

- **Debugging in Production:** Despite tests, if a bug appears:
  - Use logs first to trace the issue.
  - If logs are insufficient, you might temporarily increase log level for certain packages to DEBUG via a config update (Actuator allows changing log levels at runtime if enabled).
  - For performance, use thread dumps or heap dumps if memory leak suspected (tools like `jcmd` or through Actuator `/heapdump` if enabled).
  - In worst case, attach a remote debugger, though that's typically last resort and needs open port (not recommended in live environment).
  - Replicate the issue in a staging environment if possible, then use debugger or print statements there.

**Catching errors on Frontend:**

- Use an error tracking service like Sentry for the front-end. That can catch exceptions in React and send stack traces with user info to devs.
- Or at least, have window.onerror logging to backend (though with source maps needed to decode).
- This helps find UI bugs that might not be caught in dev (especially across different browsers).

In summary, by implementing robust logging with ELK and monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana, we can **observe the health** of our system in real time and quickly drill down into any issues:

- Logs tell us what happened,
- Metrics tell us the system's performance and load characteristics,
- Alerts ensure we don't miss critical issues,
- And proper debugging practices help isolate and fix issues when they occur.

## Automation & Integration

In this final chapter, we discuss integrating our system with external services and automating workflows that go beyond the core CRUD operations. This includes using webhooks for communication between systems, integrating external APIs, and adding features like notifications (email or Slack alerts) and real-time updates via WebSockets. These integrations can greatly enhance the functionality of the Deals Management System in a real-world environment.

### Workflow Automation & Webhooks

**Webhooks** allow our application to notify other systems about events. Instead of another system continuously polling our API for changes, we can send an HTTP request to a specified URL when a certain event occurs.

For the Deals Management System, possible events and webhooks:

- When a deal’s status changes to "WON", notify the billing/invoicing system to generate an invoice.
- When a new deal is created, notify a CRM or analytics system.
- When a deal is lost, maybe notify a Slack channel (could do via webhook or Slack API, as we'll cover).

Implementing a webhook typically:

- Let users or admins configure a webhook URL for certain events (for simplicity, we might hardcode some integration endpoints or assume one).
- When event triggers, the backend makes an HTTP POST to the URL with details.

For example, if integrating with a Slack incoming webhook for notifications:

- Slack provides a URL (from Slack App config) where you can POST a JSON payload with the message.
- We can directly call Slack’s webhook from the backend when needed.

Alternatively, define a generic Webhook entity in our system:

```java
@Entity
class Webhook {
   @Id ... Long id;
   private String url;
   private String event; // e.g., "DEAL_WON", "DEAL_CREATED"
   private String secret; // optional, to sign payloads for verification
}
```

Allow admin to add such webhooks via an API or config. Then in the code where events happen (e.g., in DealService when updating status to WON), look up any webhooks for event and send.

Pseudo-code:

```java
if (newStatus.equals("WON")) {
    List<Webhook> hooks = webhookRepo.findByEvent("DEAL_WON");
    for (Webhook hook : hooks) {
       // construct payload
       Map<String, Object> payload = Map.of(
          "dealId", deal.getId(),
          "title", deal.getTitle(),
          "value", deal.getValue(),
          "owner", deal.getOwner().getEmail(),
          "status", "WON"
       );
       // maybe sign with secret if needed
       httpClient.post(hook.getUrl(), payload);
    }
}
```

Use a non-blocking approach or at least don’t hold up the user’s request if the webhook endpoint is slow. Possibly execute webhook calls asynchronously (e.g., using `@Async` or a separate thread/executor, or a message queue like RabbitMQ or AWS SNS for reliability).
For simplicity, maybe just spawn a new thread or use CompletableFuture.

**External API Integrations:**

- The system might need to call external APIs to enrich data. For example, maybe fetch current currency exchange rates if deals value in different currency, or validate company info via a company info API.
- Those would happen in service layer. Use Spring’s RestTemplate or WebClient to call external REST APIs. Manage their responses and handle errors (with retries if needed).
- If any scheduling needed (like nightly sync with another system), use Spring’s `@Scheduled` tasks or an external scheduler.

**Examples:**

- Integrating a CRM: If an external CRM wants to receive our deals, either they poll our API or we push via webhooks as above. We could also consume their API (if, say, the system should create a contact in CRM when a deal is created).
- In advanced setups, use enterprise integration patterns or tools (Apache Camel, or Kafka for events). For instance, on each deal event, produce a Kafka message that other microservices consume. But that's beyond our single-app scope.

**Secure Webhooks:**

- If our system is receiving webhooks from others (not in our case, but if it did), we must validate signatures to ensure it's from a trusted source.
- For sending webhooks, allow setting a secret and include a signature header (like HMAC of payload with secret) so the receiver can verify.

**Example Slack Integration via Webhook:**
Slack provides an incoming webhook URL that you can send a JSON like:

```json
{ "text": "Deal *Acme Corp* was just closed as WON by John (value $50000)" }
```

and it will post that message to a channel.
We can do:

```java
if (deal.getStatus().equals("WON")) {
    String msg = "Deal *" + deal.getTitle() + "* was closed as WON by " + deal.getOwner().getName() + " (value $" + deal.getValue() + ")";
    httpClient.post(slackWebhookUrl, Collections.singletonMap("text", msg));
}
```

This simple integration can be very useful for team notifications (sales team sees updates in Slack in real-time).

> **Incoming webhooks in Slack** provide a unique URL to which our app can send JSON payloads to post messages into Slack ([Sending messages using incoming webhooks - Slack API](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#:~:text=Sending%20messages%20using%20incoming%20webhooks,you%20send%20a%20JSON%20payload)). This is an easy way to integrate with Slack without a full OAuth app.

**Email Notifications:**
We might want to send emails for certain events:

- An email to the deal owner when a deal is marked WON congratulating or giving next steps.
- A summary email to managers daily of new deals.
- Or send an email verification when a new user is registered (if sign-up allowed).

Spring Boot can send email using JavaMail (by including `spring-boot-starter-mail` and configuring SMTP details). E.g., configure SMTP server (maybe use a service like SendGrid or Amazon SES for reliability). Then use `JavaMailSender` to construct and send emails.

Example:

```java
@Autowired JavaMailSender mailSender;
...
SimpleMailMessage mail = new SimpleMailMessage();
mail.setTo(user.getEmail());
mail.setSubject("Deal "+deal.getTitle()+" closed as WON");
mail.setText("Congrats on closing the deal!");
mailSender.send(mail);
```

If sending many emails (like marketing blasts), use a service or queue them to not block.

**Reporting:**
Perhaps generate a PDF or Excel report of deals. That could be a scheduled job or on-demand (user clicks "Export deals" and backend generates file). Libraries like JasperReports or Apache POI for Excel can do that. Given advanced scope, just acknowledge:

- We can integrate with reporting libraries, or call an external reporting service.

**Real-time Updates via WebSockets:**

Our current flow: if one user updates a deal, another user won't see it until they refresh or refetch. For a more dynamic app, using **WebSockets** or similar can push updates to clients.

Spring Boot supports WebSocket (e.g., using STOMP over WebSocket with spring-websocket).
We could:

- Add dependency `spring-boot-starter-websocket`.
- Configure a WebSocket config:
  ```java
  @Configuration
  @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
  public class WebSocketConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {
      @Override
      public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {
          registry.addEndpoint("/ws").setAllowedOrigins("http://localhost:3000").withSockJS();
      }
      @Override
      public void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry registry) {
          registry.enableSimpleBroker("/topic");
          registry.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes("/app");
      }
  }
  ```
- This allows clients to subscribe to, say, `/topic/deals` and we can broadcast messages.

In the controller or service, when a deal changes:

```java
@Autowired SimpMessagingTemplate messagingTemplate;
...
messagingTemplate.convertAndSend("/topic/deals", dealDto);
```

This will send the updated deal to all subscribed.

On React side, use a library like **SockJS** and **STOMP.js** to connect:

```js
import SockJS from "sockjs-client";
import { Client } from "@stomp/stompjs";

const sock = new SockJS("http://localhost:8080/ws");
const stompClient = Stomp.over(sock);
stompClient.connect({}, () => {
  stompClient.subscribe("/topic/deals", (message) => {
    const deal = JSON.parse(message.body);
    // handle deal update, e.g., dispatch action to update state
  });
});
```

Thus, when one user marks a deal as WON, the backend updates DB and also sends a WebSocket message. All connected clients receive it and update their UI in real-time (e.g., move that deal to "Won" category visually, or show a notification).

This is an advanced feature but improves user experience significantly for collaborative systems.

> Real-time notifications using WebSockets allow for instant updates to the UI without polling. Spring Boot with STOMP and SockJS can implement a robust real-time notification system ([GitHub - zcmgyu/websocket-spring-react: Sample about Websocket using React and Spring Boot Oauth2 to send a notification between user.](https://github.com/zcmgyu/websocket-spring-react#:~:text=Spring%20Boot%20Websocket%20%2B%20React%3A,user%20notifications%20with%20web%20socket)). For example, we can notify all sales team members immediately when a new deal is added or status changes.

**Alternative real-time method:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) or libraries like Socket.IO (though socket.io is more Node ecosystem, not for Java).
Spring supports SSE via ResponseBodyEmitter or using WebFlux. But WebSockets are fine.

**Cron and Batch Jobs:**

- Perhaps a scheduled job to auto-expire deals that haven't been updated in long time (just hypothetical).
  Use Spring's @Scheduled to run a method at intervals (with a cron exp).
  Be mindful to enable scheduling with @EnableScheduling.

**Integration Testing for Integration features:**

- If using webhooks, we should test those integration points. Possibly create a dummy HTTP server in tests to catch the webhook call.
- For email, use a test SMTP server like GreenMail or simply mock JavaMailSender in unit tests.
- For WebSockets, integration tests can use Spring’s StompClient to simulate subscription and assert messages (somewhat complex but doable).

**Future Integrations:**

- If needed, expose our API to partners with API keys or OAuth. That could involve implementing OAuth2 support in Spring (like an authorization server or using an IDaaS).
- Or consume an OAuth-secured API (then we need to handle token, refresh etc. for that external API).

**External Data Sync:**
If deals need to be synced from another source (say an existing database or CRM), use either on-demand sync or periodic.
Could implement a command to import data from CSV or external API.

Given our app scope, the main ones are notifications and webhooks which we've covered.

**Wrap up:** The Deals Management System is now extended with automation and integration capabilities that could make it a part of a larger ecosystem:

- It can notify others or be notified (webhooks).
- Team members stay informed via Slack or email in real-time as deals progress.
- The app can push updates to users instantly via WebSockets, enhancing interactivity.
- These advanced integrations differentiate a real enterprise-ready system from a basic CRUD app.

Having covered everything from architecture and setup to deployment and integrations, this concludes the comprehensive guide. With these steps and principles, an advanced developer can build, scale, and maintain a robust Deals Management System using React, Spring Boot, and MySQL, and extend it as needed to meet evolving business needs.
