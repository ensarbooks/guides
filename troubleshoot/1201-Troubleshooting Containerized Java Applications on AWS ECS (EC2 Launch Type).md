# Troubleshooting Containerized Java Applications on AWS ECS (EC2 Launch Type)

**Introduction:** Running Java applications in Docker containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with the EC2 launch type can present unique challenges. ECS with EC2 launch type means you manage a cluster of EC2 instances on which your container tasks run, as opposed to using the Fargate serverless option. Java applications inside containers require careful tuning (memory, CPU) and ECS introduces additional layers (orchestration, networking, load balancing, etc.) that can fail in subtle ways. In this comprehensive guide, we will dive deep into common issues and troubleshooting techniques for ECS (EC2 launch type) deployments of Java containers. We assume the reader is an experienced DevOps engineer, so we focus on advanced insights, real-world scenarios, and best practices.

Understanding these layers helps pinpoint where issues might arise (e.g., capacity issues on EC2 instances vs. controller-level issues in ECS services) and informs the troubleshooting process._

We will cover a broad range of topics in a structured manner. The guide begins with common deployment pitfalls and Docker-level concerns (like JVM memory management in containers). We then move into ECS-specific problems (task failures, IAM roles), networking and security issues, and load balancer and health check misconfigurations. Integration with AWS monitoring tools (CloudWatch, X-Ray) is discussed, followed by CI/CD pipeline challenges in deploying to ECS. We address performance troubleshooting (latency, throughput, scaling) and strategies for effective logging, anomaly detection, and alerting. Throughout, we include real-world case studies and example scenarios to illustrate how to diagnose and resolve complex issues. Each section is organized with clear subheadings, code or configuration snippets, and example error messages to provide a practical, hands-on reference. Let’s begin our deep dive into ECS on EC2 and Java container troubleshooting.

## 1. Common Deployment Issues on ECS (EC2) for Java Containers

When deploying Java containers to ECS (EC2 launch type), you may encounter a variety of issues early in the deployment process. These typically manifest as tasks failing to start, services stuck in deployment, or containers crashing on startup. This section enumerates common deployment problems and how to troubleshoot them:

- **Image Pull Failures (Network or ECR Issues):** One frequent issue is the ECS agent failing to pull the container image from Amazon ECR or Docker Hub. In ECS with EC2 launch type, your container instances must have network access to the registry. In private subnets without a NAT Gateway or VPC endpoints, image pulls will time out. For example, a task might enter a **STOPPED** state with an error like below:

  ```plaintext
  ResourceInitializationError: unable to pull secrets or registry auth: The task cannot pull
  registry auth from Amazon ECR: There is a connection issue... dial tcp ...: i/o timeout
  ```

  ```plaintext
  CannotPullContainerError: pull image manifest has been retried 5 time(s): failed to resolve ref
  docker.io/library/httpd:2.4: ... dial tcp ...: i/o timeout
  ```

  In the above messages, the **“i/o timeout”** indicates the container instance couldn’t reach the registry. To fix this, ensure your ECS cluster instances can access the internet or ECR: for example, attach a NAT Gateway for private subnets or configure the appropriate **VPC Endpoints** (for ECR, you’d need endpoints for ECR API, ECR DKR, and S3). Confirm the instance’s IAM role (typically the **ecsInstanceRole**) has the **AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly** policy if pulling from ECR. If you see _“unable to pull secrets or registry auth”_ in the error, that could also hint at missing permissions or execution role issues (discussed later in IAM problems).

- **Wrong CPU Architecture for Image:** With the rise of multi-architecture builds (x86_64 vs arm64), it’s possible to deploy an image that isn’t compatible with the EC2 host’s CPU. ECS will attempt to run it and immediately fail. In the ECS console, you might just see a generic “Essential container in task exited” message. Checking the container’s log (e.g., via CloudWatch Logs) reveals an error such as `exec format error`. This indicates the binary in the container could not execute on the host CPU (for example, an ARM image on an x86 instance). The fix is to build or pull the image for the correct architecture or use multi-arch images. In a CI/CD pipeline, consider building both AMD64 and ARM64 images or constrain your ECS cluster to a single architecture to avoid mismatches. Always verify the base image and JVM are compatible with your EC2 instance type (most AWS ECS-optimized AMIs are x86_64 unless you intentionally use ARM instances).

- **Task Definition Errors (CPU, Memory, Ports):** A task definition with invalid parameters can prevent deployments. For example, specifying an unsupported CPU or memory value will cause the task registration to fail. Ensure the CPU and memory specified follow ECS requirements (for EC2 launch type, CPU units 128–_N_ and memory in MiB; for Fargate, only certain combinations are allowed). If you see a **“ClientException: Invalid 'cpu' setting for task”** during deployment, double-check these values. Another common mistake is misconfigured port mappings. In EC2 launch type, you might use **bridge** network mode or the newer **awsvpc** mode. If using bridge networking, container ports must be mapped to available host ports. If two tasks on the same host try to use the same host port, the second will fail placement. In awsvpc mode, each task gets its own network interface, so host ports are not used (you can usually set hostPort to 0 which means “assign an ephemeral port”). However, **all four places** where a port is defined must be consistent if you’re using a load balancer: the container’s `Dockerfile`/application listening port, the ECS task definition’s `containerPort`, the ECS service’s load balancer **target group port**, and the security group rules. Missing one of these will lead to failed health checks or no connectivity (more on that in the load balancer section). A good practice is to parameterize the port number in infrastructure-as-code so it stays consistent across the task definition, service, and load balancer.

- **Insufficient Cluster Capacity (Placement Failures):** ECS might not be able to place a task if your EC2 instances lack the required CPU, memory, or other resources. In such cases, you’ll see a service event like: _“unable to place a task because no container instance met all of its requirements. The closest matching container-instance … has insufficient memory available”_. This means ECS looked at your cluster and couldn’t find an instance with enough free RAM (or CPU) to start the new task. The solution is to either reduce the resource requirements (if they were set unnecessarily high), or scale out your cluster by adding more EC2 instances or larger instance types. Keep in mind that ECS considers _reserved_ resources – e.g., if an instance has 8GB and 6GB are already reserved by running tasks, a new task asking for >2GB won’t schedule there. Always monitor your cluster resource utilization and scale the Auto Scaling Group for your ECS instances accordingly. If you use **Capacity Providers** and **Cluster Auto Scaling**, ECS can automatically launch new EC2 instances when needed. Ensure that feature is configured so your cluster isn’t a static size that becomes a bottleneck. _Tip:_ If you consistently pack instances tightly, consider leaving some headroom or using the ECS instance reservation setting (ECS_RESERVED_MEMORY, discussed later) to avoid fully consuming memory on any single host.

- **ECS Agent or Instance Configuration Issues:** The ECS agent running on each EC2 instance is responsible for registering the instance into your cluster and communicating with the ECS control plane. If the ECS agent is misconfigured or the instance’s IAM role is missing, tasks won’t launch properly. For example, if you launch your own EC2 for ECS but forget to attach the **ecsInstanceRole**, the agent won’t be able to call ECS APIs or create necessary resources. This can cause the instance to show up as part of the cluster but not actually run any tasks (they may get stuck in PENDING or repeatedly fail). The container instance IAM role (often `arn:aws:iam::...:role/ecsInstanceRole`) **“provides permissions needed for the Amazon ECS container agent and Docker daemon to call AWS APIs on your behalf.”** Without it, actions like pulling from ECR or registering task networking can fail. Always use the official ECS-optimized AMI or ensure the ECS agent is installed and running. You can SSH to the instance and check `/var/log/ecs/ecs-agent.log` for errors. If you see messages about inability to register or permission denied errors, the instance role is likely the culprit. Also verify the instance’s security group allows it to communicate with ECS endpoints (the default is to use HTTPS to ECS service endpoint, which should be allowed out).

- **Application Crashes on Startup (Misconfiguration):** Sometimes the ECS part is fine – the task is placed on an instance and started – but the Java application inside the container crashes immediately (exit code 1 or a stack trace in logs). In ECS, if the **essential container** in a task exits, the task stops. The ECS service will usually attempt to restart it a few times (per the deployment configuration). To troubleshoot such application-level issues, retrieve the container logs. If you configured the task definition with the awslogs log driver (see Section 6), you can view logs in CloudWatch. Common causes include: missing or wrong environment variables (e.g., the app cannot find a required config like database URL or credentials), misconfigured Spring profiles or other settings, or filesystem issues (maybe a needed file wasn’t included in the image). For example, if your Java app expects a certain JVM system property or file, ensure your Docker image or ECS configuration provides it. A particular scenario in Java containers is when the application expects a certain hostname or interface – if your code binds to `localhost` or a specific IP, it might not accept connections on the awsvpc-assigned IP. Ensure the app is configured to bind to `0.0.0.0` so it listens on all interfaces (this is usually needed for web servers in Docker). In short, **check the application logs** for exceptions or errors on startup (Stack traces for misconfigurations, `ClassNotFoundException`, etc.). ECS itself will report _“Essential container in task exited”_ as the reason, which only tells you that the app inside quit. It’s up to the logs or enabling debugging (like remote debugging, if possible) to find out why. Running the same container locally with the same environment can help reproduce issues quickly.

- **Invisible Failing Tasks (Stopped Tasks):** By default, the ECS console only shows _running_ and _pending_ tasks. If a task fails immediately, it transitions to **STOPPED** and might disappear from the default view. Always switch the task filter to **“Stopped”** or **“Any”** to see recent failures. Each stopped task has a **Stopped Reason** and an **Exit Code**. These are crucial clues. For instance, _“Stopped reason: Essential container exited with exit code 143”_ indicates a graceful shutdown (143 = SIGTERM), whereas exit code 137 typically means the process was killed (often by the OOM killer). We’ll discuss OOM issues in the next section, but the point here is to make... the point here is to make sure you **inspect stopped tasks** and their exit codes. The ECS CLI/Console will show a stopped reason (e.g., _Essential container exited_ or _OutOfMemoryError_). Use commands like `aws ecs describe-tasks` to get details on stopped tasks. If tasks are failing and disappearing in the middle of the night, you might consider automating the capture of those events. For example, one could use an AWS Lambda triggered by EventBridge on ECS task state changes to log or notify when a task stops and why. This way, no failure goes unnoticed even if it’s transient.

In summary, when you encounter deployment issues, check the ECS Service **events** first (in the ECS console or via CLI). ECS often emits a descriptive event, such as _“(service my-service) failed to launch a task due to ...”_. That message can direct you to whether it’s an image issue, resource shortage, or config error. Then inspect the **stopped task** for its reason and container exit code. With those clues, you can usually zero in on whether the problem lies in the ECS configuration (network, IAM, task definition) or inside the container (application error). In the next sections, we’ll explore many of these specific areas in depth.

## 2. Docker and Image-Level Issues (Memory Leaks, Misconfigurations, JVM Tuning)

Even after a task starts successfully, issues at the **container or image level** can cause runtime problems. Java applications in containers require careful memory and JVM tuning, and misconfigurations can lead to crashes or poor performance. Here we discuss how to troubleshoot memory leaks, container resource settings, and JVM options in ECS.

- **Java Memory Leaks and OutOfMemoryErrors:** Memory management is a top concern for Java in containers. A common scenario is the application running out of heap memory (triggering a Java `OutOfMemoryError`) or the container running out of total memory (triggering the Linux OOM killer which stops the container). In ECS, if a container is killed due to exceeding its memory allocation, the ECS event might say _“OutOfMemoryError: Container killed due to memory usage”_. The task stops with exit code 137 (SIGKILL). ECS will report **“Exit Code 137”** and in the **stopped reason** you may see _“Container killed due to memory usage”_. This indicates the container tried to use more memory than its task definition allowed. To troubleshoot a suspected memory leak:

  - **Monitor Memory Usage:** Enable CloudWatch Container Insights or other monitoring on the container’s memory usage over time. A steady climb until the limit suggests a leak or overallocation. In CloudWatch, the metric **`MemoryUtilization`** for the ECS service (if using service autoscaling) or Docker metrics can show this. If using ECS on EC2, you might need to install the CloudWatch agent for granular container metrics, or rely on the ECS service-level metric which is an average.

  - **Heap vs Off-Heap Memory:** Understand that the Java heap (controlled by `-Xmx`) is only part of the process memory. Java processes also consume memory in thread stacks, JNI direct buffers, code cache, etc. It’s possible for the Java process to be killed even if the heap usage is below `Xmx`, because the **total** memory exceeded the container limit. For example, one Stack Overflow discussion noted that using `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage` to size the heap didn’t prevent the process from using more memory overall. The flags `MaxRAMPercentage` and `InitialRAMPercentage` affect the heap size but **do not cap total process memory**. This means a JVM could use memory beyond the heap (e.g., if there is a native memory leak, or simply a lot of threads) and get OOM-killed by ECS. The takeaway: leave headroom between the container’s memory limit and the JVM’s max heap setting. A common best practice is to set `Xmx` to something like 75–80% of the container memory. This allows space for non-heap usage.

  - **Enabling Heap Dumps:** To debug a heap memory leak, enable JVM options to produce a heap dump on OutOfMemoryError (e.g., `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/path/to/dumps`). However, note that if the container is killed by the OS (SIGKILL), the JVM doesn’t get a chance to do this. It only works for graceful OOM exceptions thrown by the JVM. A strategy on ECS EC2 is to write heap dumps to a volume (like an EBS volume or host path) that persists, or to an S3 bucket via some uploader, since the container filesystem may vanish. You can also use diagnostic tools: if the container is still running but nearing OOM, you can use **ECS Exec** (discussed later) or `jcmd/jmap` via an interactive shell to manually dump the heap. For advanced memory analysis, Java’s **Native Memory Tracking (NMT)** is invaluable – it can show where memory (heap vs non-heap) is being used. As one expert pointed out, you can’t set a hard limit on total memory from within the JVM, so the approach is to monitor and analyze usage with tools like NMT or profilers.

  - **Fixing Leaks:** If a memory leak in the application is identified (e.g., using Eclipse MAT on the heap dump to find large retained objects), the ultimate fix is in code. In the interim, a workaround might be to schedule periodic task restarts or use ECS deployments to cycle tasks before they hit the OOM (not ideal but sometimes necessary in production until a leak is fixed). Another potential cause of increasing memory is **Metaspace** growth (if the application loads many classes dynamically) – ensure Metaspace has an appropriate max if that’s an issue (`-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize`).

- **Container Memory and CPU Settings (Soft vs Hard Limits):** In ECS task definitions on EC2 launch type, you can specify a container’s memory in two ways: **hard limit** (`memory`) and **soft limit** (`memoryReservation`). The hard limit is an absolute max – if the container exceeds it, it’s killed. The soft limit is a reservation; the container can use more than this up to the hard limit (or up to available host memory) but ECS tries to place tasks such that the soft reservations don’t overcommit the host. For Java apps, it’s generally safer to use a hard limit to avoid any chance of two containers contending for memory and causing OOM. However, if you set only a soft limit, monitor the host’s overall memory. The ECS agent by default subtracts some memory for the OS (it uses an algorithm, or you can configure `ECS_RESERVED_MEMORY` on the container instance) so that it doesn’t schedule tasks that use 100% of host RAM. For instance, on an 8 GiB host, the actual available to ECS might be \~7.8 GiB after reserving a bit for the system. You can explicitly reserve memory for the OS by setting `ECS_RESERVED_MEMORY` in the agent config (e.g., `256` MiB). This prevents ECS from filling the instance completely with containers, which could otherwise starve the OS and Docker daemon.

  If you find your tasks OOM-killed often, consider increasing the container memory or soft limit. Check the **Stopped Reason** – if it’s “OutOfMemoryError”, that indicates the container hit the limit. If instead your Java app itself throws an `OutOfMemoryError` (visible in logs) but the container isn’t killed, that means the JVM ran out of heap _before_ the container limit was reached. In that case, you need to increase Xmx or investigate heap usage – the container had memory left but the app couldn’t utilize it because the heap max was too low (or there’s fragmentation or GC issues).

- **CPU Throttling and CPU Shares:** Besides memory, CPU configuration in ECS can affect Java performance. On EC2 launch type, if you specify a task CPU units (e.g., 1024 for 1 vCPU) and run multiple tasks per instance, the Docker runtime will enforce CPU shares or limits. By default, if `cpu` is set in the task def, it becomes a quota (a hard CPU limit) proportional to 1024 = 1 core. If a Java app is CPU-intensive and you give it 512 CPU units (i.e., half a core) as a hard limit, it will be throttled by cgroups even if the host has idle CPU. Ensure your CPU allocation is sufficient. If you notice a Java process stuck at \~100% CPU of its assigned quota and not using more, that’s a sign it’s capped. You can verify cgroup throttling by checking `cpustat` or cgroup metrics on the host. The solution is to increase the CPU units or allow bursting (on EC2, if you don’t specify `cpu` in task def, by default the container can use up to all CPU on the instance when available, subject to Linux scheduler shares). Determine if your use case needs a guaranteed slice or can benefit from opportunistic CPU.

- **JVM Garbage Collector Tuning:** Containerized environments might require GC tuning. Modern JVMs (Java 11+) are **container-aware**, meaning they detect the CPU and memory available from the cgroup. Java 8 prior to update 191 did not fully account for cgroup limits by default – but with the flag `-XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap` (Java 8) or the default `UseContainerSupport` in later versions, the JVM will size the heap based on container memory. Always use an up-to-date JVM in containers for this reason. If you’re using Java 17 or 21 (as many are by 2025), container support is built-in.

  GC selection is another aspect: the default GC (G1 in Java 11+) is generally a good balance, but if your app is small and latency-sensitive, consider Shenandoah or ZGC (if using Java 15+). If it’s batch-oriented (throughput focus, occasional long pauses acceptable), Parallel GC might give better throughput. In one case study, a team running batch jobs on ECS Fargate with Java 21 found that the JVM was not utilizing the full container memory due to the adaptive sizing of the heap – the young generation was shrinking over time. They disabled the adaptive size policy (`-XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy`), which stabilized the heap usage and allowed them to use more of the allocated memory. The lesson: watch how the JVM actually uses the memory over time. Print GC logs (`-Xlog:gc*` in Java 11+, or `-XX:+PrintGCDetails` for older) to see if frequent GCs or heap expansions/contractions are happening. In container environments where you know exactly how much memory is available, you might choose to set the heap initial size equal to max (`-Xms = -Xmx`) to avoid the JVM gradually growing the heap. This can improve predictability (though it will eagerly fill memory). The trade-off is flexibility vs. stability of memory usage.

- **Thread and Process Limits:** Containers also have process limits. By default, ECS doesn’t impose a strict PID limit on EC2 launch type (that’s more of a concern in Fargate which has a default PID limit of 1024). But if your Java app spawns many threads, each thread consumes memory for stack (usually 1MB per thread by default). A surge in threads could cause memory pressure outside of heap. Consider tuning the JVM’s stack size (`-Xss`) if you have extremely high thread counts (though typically you should reduce thread usage or use executors/pools). If you suspect the app is hitting a process/thread limit, you can attach to the container (with ECS Exec or docker exec on the host) and run commands like `ulimit -a` or check `/proc/<pid>/limits`. Generally, ECS on EC2 inherits the host’s limits, which are high.

- **Filesystem and Disk Concerns:** Ensure that your container has the needed files and directories. In ECS EC2, containers by default use the host’s storage (usually the EC2’s ephemeral disk or EBS volume). If your Java app writes logs to the container’s filesystem (instead of stdout), those files reside on the host under `/var/lib/docker/...`. Large logs or tmp files could fill the disk over time, affecting not just that container but others. Use a log driver to offload logs (CloudWatch) or mount a volume and set up a log rotation. If the application expects to write to, say, `/tmp` or `/var`, remember that gets wiped when the task stops (unless you use Docker volumes). For persistent data (like a cache or database), use external storage (EFS, S3, or an external DB).

- **Dockerfile Best Practices & Config:** Some issues stem from how the image is built. For example, if the Java app needs certain OS packages (fonts, TLS certificates, etc.), ensure the Dockerfile installs them. A classic example is missing CA certificates leading to SSL handshake failures when the app tries to call an external HTTPS endpoint. If you see connectivity errors in logs, verify the base image includes `ca-certificates` (for Debian/Alpine, etc.). Another Dockerfile tip: set `WORKDIR` appropriately so relative paths in the app work. If a Java framework looks for configuration in the working directory, and the Dockerfile didn’t set it (thus defaulting to `/`), it might not find files. Also, double-check the ENTRYPOINT/CMD – if these are wrong, the container might start and immediately exit (e.g., if the script is missing `exec` form or path is wrong). For Tomcat-based apps, ensure the catalina.sh is called properly; for Spring Boot fat jars, a common CMD is `java -jar app.jar`. In short, if the container exits almost instantly with no clear error, it could be the entrypoint/command mis-specified. Running the image locally (`docker run`) with the same command can help identify such issues.

In summary, treat the Java container as you would a normal Java deployment, but **account for the container constraints**. Set your JVM memory options in line with the container limits (with some cushion), keep an eye on native memory usage, and use available tools (profilers, dumps, monitoring) to catch leaks or bottlenecks. Many tough issues (like an OOMKill) require looking at both ECS (to see that it was an OOMKill) and inside the JVM (to see why memory grew). With ECS, always correlate an ECS event (like “task stopped due to memory”) with the container’s own logs/metrics at that time.

## 3. ECS-Specific Problems (Tasks Failing, Service Restarts, IAM Role Issues)

Beyond container internals, many issues are unique to ECS itself. These include tasks that keep stopping or restarting due to ECS health checks or deployment rules, misconfigurations in ECS service definitions, and IAM role problems that prevent tasks from accessing resources. In this section, we focus on those ECS-specific issues.

- **Task Stopped Reason Codes and Repeated Failures:** When an ECS task is stopped, ECS provides a reason. Common reasons:

  - _Essential container exited_ – This is a catch-all indicating the main container in the task died (could be due to an error, OOM, etc.). You then look at that container’s exit code or logs.
  - _Scaling activity initiated by deployment_ – This indicates the service is replacing tasks as part of a deployment (not a failure per se).
  - _Service **circuit breaker** triggered_ – If you enabled the deployment circuit breaker, a task failing to become healthy can cause ECS to stop the deployment and optionally rollback (more below on circuit breaker).
  - _Task failed ELB health checks_ – The task was stopped because it didn’t pass load balancer health checks (ECS will log an event like “service X (port 8080) is unhealthy in target-group Y due to (reason Health check failed)”). This is a very common cause of a “service restart” loop.

  If a service’s tasks are continually dying, the **Deployment** in ECS may never stabilize. ECS by default (without circuit breaker) will keep trying to launch new tasks indefinitely. Since 2020, you can enable a deployment **circuit breaker** which will auto-stop a bad deployment and mark it failed instead of infinite retry. On the ECS console, this is a checkbox (“Enable rollback on failure”), and if you use CloudFormation, you add the `DeploymentConfiguration` with `DeploymentCircuitBreaker` settings. It’s a good idea to enable this, so you don’t get stuck in an endless cycle of failing tasks. Instead, the deployment will rollback to the last good version after a certain number of failures, or fail outright for investigation.

- **Load Balancer Health Check Failures (and Service restarts):** ECS services often integrate with an ALB or NLB. If an ALB target group marks a task unhealthy, ECS will stop that task (because it’s not passing health checks) and start a new one, trying to get a healthy replacement. This can look like the service “keeps restarting.” The key is to identify **why health checks are failing**:

  - Ensure the container is actually listening on the expected port. If your task definition says container port 8080, your Spring Boot or Tomcat app must be configured to listen on 8080. A mismatch will cause connection refused on health check.
  - Check the health check **path** and **protocol**. For HTTP health checks, ALB will send an HTTP GET to the configured path (e.g., “/health”) on the container. If you left it at “/” but your app doesn’t respond on “/”, the check will fail. Common practice for Java microservices is to have a dedicated health endpoint (like `/health` or `/actuator/health` in Spring). Configure the target group health check path to match. Also, consider the **health check grace period** in the ECS service – this is how long ECS will wait after a task starts before routing health checks to it. If your app takes 60 seconds to initialize but the grace period is 30, the ALB will start checking too soon and possibly mark it unhealthy. Set an adequate grace period (e.g., 90 seconds for a heavier Java app) to give it time to warm up.
  - Look at ALB target group **CloudWatch metrics** or **access logs**. ALB provides metrics for healthy/unhealthy host counts. If unhealthy count is >0, it’s failing. Enabling ALB access logs (to S3) can let you see the health check requests and responses. For instance, you might find the app responded 404 to the health URL because the context isn’t ready. The ALB access log or container logs will show that. As a best practice, turn on ALB access logs and ensure your container also logs health check hits. By comparing the two, you can determine if the requests are reaching the container. If ALB logs show health check attempts but container log shows nothing, likely the traffic never got to the app – check security groups (the ALB SG must be allowed in the task’s SG) or networking.
  - **Mitigation strategy:** One trick while debugging is to run a task _outside_ of the service’s load balancer to test it manually. You can do this by using the ECS “Run Task” manually (with the same task definition, but not attached to the service or target group). Then, find the IP of that task (if awsvpc) or connect via the host, and attempt a `curl` to the health endpoint. This can reveal what the health check actually returns (maybe it’s an error or requires auth). If the task shuts down on its own even outside the LB, then the problem is with the application (it’s crashing regardless of LB). If it stays up fine and responds to health pings, the problem is likely with the load balancer configuration or the service integration. Make sure the **security group** on the task allows the ALB’s security group to connect on the health check port – if not, the health check traffic is blocked.

  In summary, ECS service restarts usually indicate either health check failures or application crashes. Health check issues are solved by aligning configurations (ports, paths, timing). Application crashes we addressed in section 1 and above (check logs for exceptions or OOMs). Use the circuit breaker to avoid endless loops and give yourself a chance to fix the deployment.

- **IAM Role Misassignments (Task Role vs Execution Role):** AWS IAM roles are critical in ECS, and there are two distinct roles to consider:

  1. **Task Execution Role** – this is for ECS agent to use when starting your task. It’s used for pulling images from ECR, fetching secrets from Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, and sending logs to CloudWatch. By default, AWS suggests using the managed policy **`AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy`** on this role. If you use secrets or pull private images, you may need to add permissions (e.g., `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`) to this execution role.
  2. **Task Role (a.k.a. Task IAM Role)** – this is assumed by the **application running in the container**. The container can use AWS SDKs and will get credentials via the ECS agent to perform actions (e.g., read from S3, write to DynamoDB) as defined by this role’s policies.

  A very common mistake is to confuse these two. If you put application permissions in the execution role instead of the task role, your app won’t have them (because the app only gets the task role). Conversely, if you forget to give needed permissions to the execution role, the task might not even start properly. For example, if you configure a container to use a secret for an environment variable, ECS will try to retrieve that secret’s value using the execution role. If that role doesn’t have `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` for that secret, the task launch will fail with an error: _“unable to retrieve secret... AccessDeniedException”_. The ECS service event might be somewhat cryptic, but in the ECS agent logs or service events you’d find an error with **AccessDeniedException** and the ARN of the execution role, complaining about missing permission. In the ECS console, this often surfaces as a **“ResourceInitializationError: unable to pull secrets or registry auth”** error, which can mislead you to think it’s a network issue, whereas the real cause is in the middle of the message: the access denied. The solution is to attach the required permission to the **task execution role**.

  Another example: if your app container needs to write to S3 or CloudWatch Logs directly using AWS SDK, you should grant those permissions to the **task role** (not the execution role). If you accidentally put them in the execution role, the app will get “Access Denied” at runtime because the container’s credentials are from the task role which lacks them. Always double-check which role to use:

  - Use **execution role** for permissions needed during provisioning (pulling images, decrypting secrets, pushing logs).
  - Use **task role** for the application’s business permissions.

  If you encounter mysterious permission errors in the application logs (AWS SDK errors), verify the task role. If you encounter task startup failures with resource access messages, verify the execution role. AWS’s documentation emphasizes that the task execution role is used by ECS to launch the task, whereas the task role is assumed by the containers at runtime. Keeping this straight will save a lot of debugging time.

- **ECS Agent and Instance Role Issues:** We touched on the instance IAM role earlier. Let’s expand: The container instances (EC2) also use an IAM role (commonly named _ecsInstanceRole_). This role allows the ECS agent to, for example, register the instance, report status, and send CloudWatch logs if using the awslogs driver (prior to execution role introduction, the instance role was also used to write logs). If you see in the agent log lines about inability to connect or authenticate to ECS endpoints, ensure the instance role is correct. Starting around 2018, the execution role was introduced so that the instance role no longer needs ECR or CloudWatch Logs permissions – those moved to execution role. But the instance role still needs the basic **AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role** policy (or its modern equivalent) for ECS to function. In a scenario described by a user, new tasks weren’t starting on an EC2 instance that had always worked; it turned out the instance’s IAM role had been changed and no longer had proper permissions, causing the ECS agent to fail silently and not start tasks. They fixed it by updating the EC2 instance’s IAM role and restarting the agent. After that, tasks could be provisioned on that instance again. So if tasks won’t start on a particular instance, check the **`/var/log/ecs/ecs-agent.log`** on that instance for errors (like inability to attach ENIs or assume roles). Also, ensure that the instance’s **security groups** and **subnets** allow it to communicate as needed. Instances in private subnets should have a route to ECS endpoints (either via NAT or VPC endpoints for ECS). If not, the agent might not register properly.

- **Tasks Stuck in PENDING:** If you have a service with desired count X and you see tasks in PENDING state for a long time, something is preventing them from transitioning to RUNNING. Reasons can include the capacity issues (no instance available) discussed above or networking issues (for awsvpc mode, if ECS cannot allocate an ENI for the task, it will stay in PENDING until timeout). ENI allocation can fail if you hit limits (each EC2 instance type has a max number of ENIs and IP addresses). For example, a t2.micro can only handle 2 ENIs (one for the instance, one for one task’s ENI). If you try to run a second awsvpc task on the same t2.micro, it will hang in PENDING until ECS finds another instance. The ECS service event might not explicitly say “ENI limit,” but it will say unable to place task. Check your VPC subnet IP availability as well – if subnets are nearly exhausted, tasks might pend waiting for an IP. The fix is to use instance types with higher ENI limits or scale out instances. AWS’s Best Practices Guide mentions that awsvpc networking adds a bit of latency when attaching ENIs, but the bigger concern is hitting ENI quotas. If you suspect ENI issues, CloudWatch has metrics for ENI allocation or you can see errors in the ECS agent log.

- **Service Discovery and DNS Issues:** ECS can integrate with AWS Cloud Map for service discovery. If enabled, each task registers a DNS entry. Problems can occur if the service discovery is misconfigured:

  - If tasks appear healthy but one service cannot reach another by name, verify that the ECS service has service discovery enabled and that the names are being created in Cloud Map. You can go to the Cloud Map console (or use `aws servicediscovery` CLI) to list instances in the namespace. If nothing is there, the registration failed – check the CloudWatch Logs for the **service discovery agent** (ECS service discovery uses AWS Cloud Map under the hood, errors might show in service events).
  - Ensure both services are in the same VPC and DNS namespace if you expect to use DNS names to reach each other. If not using Cloud Map, ECS also injects environment variables for linked services but that’s more in ECS Compose or older linking; in modern setups, one uses Cloud Map or an ELB.
  - A Reddit thread on ECS service discovery noted to confirm the service was correctly registered and that DNS resolution was working; lack of DNS resolution usually means a registration issue. Also, the tasks’ security groups must allow traffic. Even if DNS is set up, the connection can be blocked by SG rules. So double-check that aspect in a cross-service scenario (e.g., service A’s SG allows inbound from service B’s SG or from the subnet).

  If you see an ECS service discovery failure event, it might say something like _“Attribute propagation error”_ or similar, indicating it couldn’t register with Cloud Map. This could be due to a naming conflict or missing permissions (the service’s execution role needs AWS Cloud Map permissions if using service discovery). Ensure the execution role has the AWSCloudMapRegisterInstance policy if you use that feature.

- **ECS Anywhere / External Instances:** (If you’re not using ECS Anywhere, you can skip this.) With ECS Anywhere (running tasks on on-prem servers), there can be additional points of failure like the connectivity agent. Ensure the on-prem instances maintain connection to AWS and have proper certificates. Any flakiness will also cause tasks to fail similarly. The troubleshooting methods remain: check the ECS Agent logs and AWS CloudWatch for any errors.

To summarize ECS-specific issues: Use the ECS **service events and task stopped reasons** as your starting point. They often pinpoint the cause (e.g., `was unable to place a task because...` or `task stopped due to...`). Distinguish between ECS orchestration problems (capacity, network, IAM) and application-level problems (which surface through ECS as generic exits). Misconfigurations like wrong IAM roles or security groups can be elusive – the service might just say “stopped reason: Access denied” in a long message. Reading the entire message is crucial. The ECS agent and AWS integration provide a lot of diagnostics if you know where to look: CloudWatch Logs (for tasks and maybe for the agent via SSM), AWS CloudTrail (if someone changed a role or security group, it’d be logged), and service events. Next, we’ll tackle networking and security in more detail, since they are tightly related to some issues discussed here.

## 4. Networking and Security Issues (ENIs, Security Groups, Service Discovery)

Networking is a frequent source of problems in ECS deployments. With the EC2 launch type, you manage VPC settings, subnet assignments, security groups, and more. Each ECS task launched with the **awsvpc** network mode gets its own Elastic Network Interface (ENI) and can have its own security group. This gives a lot of flexibility (and security isolation) but also introduces complexity. Here’s how to troubleshoot common networking and security issues:

- **ENI Exhaustion and IP Limits:** As mentioned, each task (awsvpc mode) consumes an IP address and ENI on the host. AWS EC2 instances have limits on how many ENIs and IPs per ENI they support, based on instance size. For example, a c5.large might support up to 3 ENIs (1 primary, 2 secondary) and perhaps 10 IPs per ENI. That means at most maybe 2 tasks (if each gets its own ENI) on that instance, or if ECS attaches multiple IPs per ENI, a bit more. If your ECS service suddenly can’t scale out further or new tasks stay in PENDING, check CloudWatch metrics for **EC2 available IPs** in your subnets and the **ENI quota**. If you hit the ENI limit on an instance, ECS will need another instance to place more tasks. Either scale out the ASG or use bigger instances. You may see an event like _“Unable to attach network interface”_ in the ECS agent logs if this happens. AWS documentation suggests that **awsvpc** networking can introduce a slight delay (a few seconds) because it has to create and attach the ENI before the task can start. So if tasks are slow to transition to RUNNING, it might be just ENI attachment time – that’s normal (especially if you launch many tasks at once, they queue ENI creation calls). However, if tasks _never_ start, suspect ENI issues. Solutions:

  - **Capacity Provider with Managed Scaling:** This can automatically add instances when needed (if tasks are waiting). Make sure it’s configured if dynamic scaling is required.
  - **Container Instance Draining:** If you’re deliberately maintaining a small number of instances, consider that during a deployment, ECS will start new tasks before stopping old (for a service with maxSurge > 0). This temporarily increases task count and could require an extra ENI or IP. If none is available, deployment stalls. Plan for that by leaving a buffer or scaling out during deployments.

- **Security Group Misconfiguration:** Each task’s ENI is associated with one or more security groups. For web applications behind an ALB, a common pattern is:

  - ALB has a security group (e.g., `alb-sg`) that allows inbound from 0.0.0.0/0 on port 80/443 (for public ALB).
  - Tasks have a security group (e.g., `ecs-service-sg`) that allows inbound from the ALB’s SG on the container port (say 8080).
  - The tasks’ SG might also allow inbound from within the SG itself if inter-task communication is needed (or from another SG if another service calls it).
  - Outbound, by default SGs allow all, which is fine for most cases (this allows containers to call external services or databases).

  Issues arise if any of these rules are wrong or missing. For instance, if the task’s SG doesn’t include the ALB SG in its inbound rules, the health checks and traffic from ALB will be dropped – resulting in the task never becoming healthy. This is a silent problem: ECS will just report unhealthy, and your app logs might show nothing. Always verify that the **source of traffic is permitted by the target’s SG**. For service-to-service comms, if Service A needs to call Service B:

  - You could give Service B’s SG an inbound rule from Service A’s SG on the needed port.
  - Alternatively, if using Cloud Map DNS, often people put both services in the same SG and open that SG to itself (which allows any instance of either service to talk). This is simpler but less granular.

  If using host networking or bridge networking, then security groups apply at the EC2 host level (the instance’s SG). In that case, ensure the host SG allows the relevant ports. For example, with bridge mode and host port 8080, the EC2’s SG must allow 8080 from the ALB or whatever source. Many deployments use awsvpc now because it simplifies each service having its own SG, which is easier to reason about. But it’s important to remember: **for traffic to flow between ALB <-> Task or Task A <-> Task B, the SG rules on both sides must allow it** (ALB’s SG allows outbound to tasks by default since SG outbound is open, tasks SG must allow inbound; for response traffic, the security groups and established connection tracking handle it as long as initial inbound is allowed).

  If encountering connectivity issues, use tools: for ALB->Task, you can’t easily SSH into Fargate tasks, but on ECS EC2 you can SSH to the instance and use `curl http://localhost:8080` if the task is host mode, or `curl http://<task-enI-ip>:8080` if awsvpc (the task ENI IP will be reachable from the host itself if you enable the flag to attach ENI to the host’s network namespace – if not, you might need to test from within the container via ECS Exec). Alternatively, use a bastion in the same subnet to curl the task ENI directly by IP to see if it responds. If it does, likely SG is fine and ALB health check might be misconfigured. If it doesn’t respond or times out, likely SG or the app not listening.

- **No Internet Access in Private Subnet:** This was touched on with image pull, but also affects runtime. Suppose your Java app needs to call an external API (e.g., a payment gateway). If your tasks run in private subnets (no public IP) and you have no NAT Gateway or NAT instance, those calls will hang. Symptoms: parts of the app that call out to the internet time out, but internal functionality is fine. The fix is the same: provide egress to the internet via NAT Gateway or appropriate VPC endpoints if the service has one (for AWS services, prefer VPC endpoints; for general internet, NAT is required). Always ensure internal services can reach external resources if needed. If you intentionally want to _deny_ internet access (for security), then be sure the app doesn’t need it, or explicitly document such constraints.

- **DNS Configuration:** ECS tasks (awsvpc) by default use the VPC’s DNS (which can resolve Route 53 private zones, etc.). If your application relies on DNS (e.g., to reach a database host or another service), issues can occur if the VPC DNS is misconfigured. Ensure the VPC has DNS resolution and DNS hostnames enabled (especially important if using AWS services like RDS which rely on DNS, or if using ECS service discovery). If your tasks need to use custom DNS (say for on-prem resolution via Direct Connect), you might have custom DHCP options set – verify the containers can resolve those names (you might have to tweak `/etc/resolv.conf` in the container or use `dnsServers` in ECS task def if custom). Generally, let AWS DNS do its thing unless a special requirement exists.

- **Service Discovery / Cloud Map Issues:** If you configured service discovery in the ECS service (Cloud Map integration), a task failing to register or deregister properly can cause stale or missing DNS entries:

  - When tasks come up, they register with Cloud Map (creating an A or SRV record). If this fails (due to permissions or Cloud Map limits), the task still runs but other services won’t know its DNS. You’d see a Cloud Map error in ECS service events.
  - When tasks die, they deregister. If a task is killed forcibly (OOM kill or abrupt stop), ECS will still attempt deregistration. Cloud Map has a TTL for DNS records; if a dereg fails, a stale IP could linger for that TTL, causing callers to attempt connecting to a now-dead task. If you suspect this, you may reduce the TTL in Cloud Map settings for the service to minimize impact.
  - If using Cloud Map health checks (which integrate with ECS or Route 53), a misconfigured health check can deregister instances prematurely. For ECS, typically we rely on ECS itself to manage Cloud Map entries as tasks start/stop.

  To troubleshoot service discovery: verify that when Service A tries to reach “serviceB.myapps.internal” (for example), the name resolves to the IP(s) of Service B’s tasks. You can exec into a running container of Service A and use `nslookup` or `dig` to see what it gets. If resolution fails (timeout or NXDOMAIN), the issue is with Cloud Map/Route53 registration. If it resolves to an IP that’s wrong, possibly a stale record or maybe you have multiple environments and the wrong namespace. If it resolves correctly but connect fails, then it’s likely security groups or the service not actually listening (back to previous points).

- **Inconsistent Network Mode or Ports:** In some cases, people mix network modes in one task definition (one container on bridge, another on host, etc.). This can lead to confusion – it’s generally not allowed to mix in one task (all containers share the same network mode per task). Ensure all containers in a task use the same network mode as set at task level. If you are not using awsvpc, likely you use bridge or host. **Bridge mode** means containers get an internal docker network IP (like 172.17.x.x) and the host does port-mapping. **Host mode** means containers use the host’s network directly (no isolation). Host mode might be needed for applications that require fixed ports or for network performance, but then only one such container can run per host per port. If using host mode, you also can’t use ECS service discovery per task (since tasks don’t get unique ENIs for DNS registration, though you can register the host). Host mode often is used with daemon tasks (one per host, like logging agents). Just be mindful which mode you chose as it affects how you troubleshoot. For bridge mode, you examine Docker’s port mappings (e.g., `docker ps` on the instance will show host->container port). For awsvpc, you treat the task like a separate host with its own IP.

- **Container to Container Communication (within a Task):** If you have multiple containers in the same task (sidecar pattern), they usually can reach each other via `localhost` (if in default bridge network or awsvpc mode, ECS will put them in the same ENI and namespace by default). However, in awsvpc each container actually has its own network namespace and they communicate through the ENI’s IP (like separate EC2s on the same subnet). ECS does set up a shared “loopback” for container dependencies? Actually, with awsvpc, containers in a task can communicate via the ENI IP (they are essentially like two processes on the same host with the same ENI but different network namespaces). ECS maps the **`localhost` for each container to itself only**, unlike Docker Compose on a single host where containers share a bridge and can use container names to talk. In ECS awsvpc, containers in the same task must communicate via the ENI’s **internal IP** or by using `127.0.0.1` only if you enabled the `networkMode: awsvpc` and also set `enableNetworkNamespaceSharing` (this is an option that allows containers to share the network namespace – typically used for sidecars like an X-Ray daemon so the app can hit 127.0.0.1:2000 for X-Ray). If you intend to use `localhost` between containers in one task, you must configure namespace sharing. Otherwise, treat them as separate hosts and use the task IP. This nuance can trip up configurations like an app expecting a sidecar on localhost. The fix is either set the sidecar container’s address in the app config to the task ENI IP, or enable namespace sharing in the task definition.

- **Firewall and NACLS:** Don’t forget if your VPC has NACLs on subnets, they can also block traffic (though in many setups NACLs are left open default). If you have a NACL denying certain ports or IP ranges, that could cause issues similarly to security groups, but NACLs operate at subnet level statelessly. Usually focus on SGs first, as they are stateful and easier to manage.

**Networking troubleshooting tools and tips:** If you suspect networking:

- Use **VPC Flow Logs**. You can turn on flow logs for the subnets and filter for the ENI of your task. It will show allowed/denied traffic. If you see “REJECT” for the health check port from ALB’s IP to the task ENI, you know an SG or NACL is blocking.
- Use **ping/curl** from within containers (via ECS Exec or attaching a sidecar debug container) to test connectivity to other services or the internet.
- Check **Route 53** (if using private DNS for service discovery) to ensure records exist and point to the right IPs.
- For DNS issues, ensure the **ECS Agent DNS config** hasn’t been changed – by default it uses AmazonProvidedDNS in the VPC. If someone set `ECS_ENABLE_AWSLOGS_EXECUTIONROLE_OVERRIDE` or other agent configs related to DNS, double-check those.

In summary, treat each ECS task as its own mini-server when it comes to networking. All the usual network rules apply (IP, port, SG, route, etc.), just automated by ECS. If something can’t talk to something else, systematically check name resolution, then SG/NACL, then the app’s listener. ECS and CloudWatch provide many clues (target group health, flow logs, etc.). Often the “it was a security group issue” is the root cause, so always verify those when troubleshooting connectivity.

## 5. Load Balancing and Health Check Misconfigurations

We’ve already covered some aspects of load balancing in prior sections (especially how health check failures can kill tasks). Here we consolidate guidance specific to load balancers (particularly Application Load Balancers, ALB) and ECS services, and common mistakes in their configuration:

- **Target Group Port vs Container Port:** When you create an ECS service with a load balancer, you must specify a target group and the container port to register. ECS will automatically attach the container’s IP to the target group on that port. One mistake can be if you later change the container’s port in the task definition but forget to update the service’s config or target group. For example, initially you ran your Java app on port 8080 and the target group health check and target port are set to 8080. If you then change the app to 9090 (and update Dockerfile, etc.) but don’t change the ECS service’s configured container port, ECS will still register targets on 8080 – which might now be closed, causing every health check to fail. Make sure that **all references to the port are updated** when you change it (target group, ECS service, security groups).

- **Health Check Path and Protocol:** By default, an ALB target group health check uses path “/” over HTTP. Many Java web apps will either 1) not have anything at root (resulting in 404), or 2) possibly require HTTPS. If your container only listens on HTTPS (maybe it’s a Spring Boot with SSL enabled), and the target group is configured for HTTP, the health check will never succeed because the ALB is speaking plain HTTP to an HTTPS endpoint (or vice versa). Ensure the **protocol** matches (ALB health checks can be HTTP or HTTPS). If you use HTTPS health checks, the target group needs to trust the certificate your container presents (for internal services, people often use self-signed or internal CAs; ALB will not by default trust self-signed certs on targets and may show them as unhealthy or throw an SSL error – in such cases, do HTTP health checks on an HTTP port or use a proper certificate). If your app requires some header or auth on health endpoint, consider disabling auth for the specific health URL or using a simpler `/ping` endpoint. Keep health checks lightweight.

- **Health Check Interval and Timeouts:** ALB health checks default to 30s interval, 5 failed threshold. That means 2.5 minutes of failures to mark unhealthy (and require 5 consecutive successes to mark healthy when recovering). In ECS, a deployment will wait for at least two successful health checks by default before considering a task healthy (hence minimum \~1 minute if using default 30s\*2). If you want faster failover, you might reduce the interval (say 10s) and thresholds (maybe 2 or 3). But be cautious: too frequent can overload the app if it has many targets, and too few successes might cause flapping if there’s transient latency. If you make it too short (say 5s interval, 2 failures threshold), a minor blip could mark healthy tasks as dead. So tune according to your app’s behavior. For example, if your Java app sometimes does stop-the-world GC pauses of say 1-2s, a 5s interval might catch it during a pause and mark unhealthy if threshold is low. Using 10s interval and 3 failures would give it a 30s cushion.

- **Connection Draining (Deregistration Delay):** When ECS needs to stop a task (say during scale-in or deployment replacement), if attached to an ALB target group, ECS will deregister it. ALB has a **deregistration delay** (default 300 seconds) during which it will finish ongoing requests to that target but not send new ones. ECS will ideally wait for this draining to complete or the timeout to hit before killing the container (when using managed ALB integration, ECS coordinates this). If users report requests being cut off or dropped during deployments, check if perhaps the deregistration delay is too short or if the container is exiting before draining is done. The ECS service has a setting “deployment minimum healthy percentage” which by default is 100% (meaning it won’t kill old tasks until new are ready if using rolling update without circuit breaker). If someone set a low minimum healthy percent (like 0), it could theoretically take down all tasks at once (for e.g., blue/green deployment scenario outside CodeDeploy). Ensure deployment settings are sane (typically keep minimum healthy 50% or higher for rolling updates, so you never drop below half capacity during deployments, unless you intentionally want downtime). In short, connection draining should normally prevent any dropped connections – if you see issues, verify that the tasks aren’t being forced to stop before draining (maybe an overly aggressive shutdown script in the container?). Implement graceful shutdown in the app: e.g., catch SIGTERM in your Java app (Spring Boot does this by default and will try to shut down gracefully) and ensure it stops accepting new requests (maybe via a health check fail on shutdown start) and waits a bit for active requests to complete.

- **Multiple Load Balancers or No Load Balancer:** Some ECS services might have multiple target groups (ECS now supports up to 2 per service, useful if you have an ALB and NLB for the same tasks, or IPv6 vs IPv4). If configured, ensure both target group health checks are considered – ECS by default will require all target group health checks to be passing for a task to be healthy. If you don’t actually need two, avoid complexity. On the other end, if you choose **not** to use a load balancer at all (maybe clients directly call tasks, or you use service discovery), ensure you disable the load balancer health check in ECS service (i.e., don’t attach one, and maybe turn on container-level health checks as an alternative). ECS can use container health checks (defined in the Dockerfile with `HEALTHCHECK` and in task def) to decide if a container is healthy. If you have those, a failing container health check can also cause ECS to restart a task. So either rely on ALB or container health checks or both if you know what you’re doing, but tune them properly to avoid conflict (for instance, if container health check is too strict and causes restart while ALB still thinks it’s fine, you might get flapping).

- **Sticky Sessions and Session Management:** If you use ALB sticky sessions (cookie-based), ensure the Java application instances can handle it. Typically in microservices you’d avoid sticky sessions and just use stateless or externalize session state (database or Redis). If stickiness is on and tasks are cycling, a user might get a cookie for a target that goes away – ALB should handle re-routing in that case by updating the cookie on next response, but just be aware of it. Check that your ALB target group stickiness is configured as you intend (default is off for ALB).

- **Routing configurations:** If using advanced ALB features like path-based or host-based routing (multiple services behind one ALB with different listeners or rules), a misconfiguration could send traffic to the wrong target group or not at all. For example, say you have ALB with two rules: `/api/*` -> Service A’s TG, `/web/*` -> Service B’s TG. If your client requests don’t have the trailing slash or something, ALB might send to default target (which could be none or another service). Always test the routing rules with actual URLs. One common error outside ECS context is forgetting to include the trailing /\* in path rules (in console if you just put `/api` it might treat as exact match vs `/api/*` as prefix). So be mindful as this could make it seem like “service is down” when actually ALB isn’t forwarding to it.

**Troubleshooting LB issues recap:** Use the ALB’s **Target Group** section in the AWS console – it shows the health status of each registered target (IP and port). If a target is unhealthy, it often gives a reason (like “Health check failed with 404”). That is a direct clue to what the app responded. Use ALB access logs for details. Also, CloudWatch metrics for the ALB (like `UnHealthyHostCount`) and for the Target Response Time can indicate if the app is slow or timing out. If ALB reports a target “Connection timeout,” it means ALB couldn’t establish a TCP connection – likely the container isn’t listening or SG blocked. If it reports “HTTP 500” as health check response, then the app is returning 500 for that endpoint (perhaps dependencies not ready). So each error guides the fix: closed port -> fix SG/ports; 404/500 -> fix app or path; timeout -> check app up and not overloaded, etc.

Finally, if you use **Network Load Balancers (NLB)** for ECS (less common for HTTP apps, more for things like gRPC or non-HTTP protocols), note that NLB health checks are basic (TCP or HTTP, but no host header etc.). NLB will mark a target unhealthy if the TCP connection is refused or not established. So similar principles: ensure container is listening and SG allows the NLB’s static IPs (with NLB, the source will be the NLB’s own fixed IP in the subnet, which usually is within the VPC CIDR – by default, NLB’s SG if you have one, or rather the instance SG must allow the NLB’s traffic, but NLB inverts the model by not having SG itself, so you allow the client or NLB’s source range). For NLB + ECS on EC2, the instance SG must allow the client or load balancer range on the host port if host mode, or container SG allow if awsvpc with NLB (the NLB will hit the ENI directly).

In conclusion, load balancer misconfigurations often boil down to mismatched expectations between ALB and the container. The remedy is to align them and use the diagnostic info ALB provides. And always remember to update ECS service settings if you change something fundamental like the container port or health check path in your application.

## 6. Integration with AWS CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Other Monitoring Tools

A critical part of operating containerized applications is monitoring and observability. AWS offers CloudWatch for logs and metrics, X-Ray for distributed tracing, and Container Insights for granular metrics. Let’s go through integrating these with ECS and troubleshooting issues that arise.

- **CloudWatch Logs (Container Logs):** Amazon ECS can forward your container’s stdout/stderr to CloudWatch Logs using the **awslogs** driver. In your task definition’s container definition, you specify:

  ```json
  "logConfiguration": {
      "logDriver": "awslogs",
      "options": {
          "awslogs-group": "/ecs/YourServiceName",
          "awslogs-region": "us-east-1",
          "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs"
      }
  }
  ```

  With this, the ECS agent on the EC2 instance will ship logs to CloudWatch. Common issues:

  - **Logs not appearing in CloudWatch:** First, ensure the CloudWatch log group exists (ECS can auto-create it if the execution role has permissions, but if not, you may need to create it manually). The task **execution role** needs permission `logs:CreateLogStream` and `logs:PutLogEvents`. The managed `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` covers this. If logs aren’t coming, check if the execution role was set and has the policy. If using a custom execution role, maybe CloudWatch Logs perms were omitted.
  - **Wrong log group or region:** If the task definition specifies a log group in a different region or a typo in name, logs might be lost. Always double-check region and group name in the options.
  - **Task not starting due to log config:** In some cases, if the execution role can’t write logs, the task might actually still start (the app runs but logs don’t go out) – but if the issue is permissions, ECS typically doesn’t kill the task for that, it just fails to send logs. So lack of logs is your only symptom.
  - **Multiple log streams:** Each container gets its own log stream, typically named by container ID or task ID prefix. Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to aggregate if needed. For ECS on EC2, the logs are fetched by the agent on the host – ensure the host’s time is synced (CloudWatch will reject logs with timestamps too far in future/past).

  **Troubleshooting CloudWatch Logs**: If no logs, try to reproduce locally or check if the container printed anything (maybe the app is silent?). You can also SSH to the EC2 host and inspect Docker containers directly (`docker logs`) to see if logs exist – if they do, the problem is shipping them out. If they don’t, maybe the app isn't running properly (or logging to a file instead of console).

  - **Alternative Logging**: Some use sidecar log shippers (like Fluent Bit/Fluentd) to send logs to Elasticsearch, Splunk, etc. If using those, ensure they have correct volumes mounted to read the container logs and that they themselves are monitored. In ECS EC2, you have full flexibility to run an daemon set of Fluentd on each instance to gather logs.

- **CloudWatch Metrics (ECS/EC2 level):** CloudWatch automatically collects some ECS metrics:

  - Service-level metrics: CPUUtilization and MemoryUtilization (%) for the service (this is an average across tasks, based on the resource usage relative to the task definition’s allocated CPU/mem).
  - These can be used for autoscaling triggers. If you find these metrics not showing, ensure “Enable Container Insights” is turned on (in the ECS console or by AWS CLI for ECS). In EC2 launch type, enabling Container Insights actually sets up CloudWatch agent on the ECS instances (if you opt in via ECS console, it may handle some of this behind the scenes). If you did it manually, you might need to run the CloudWatch agent as a DaemonSet or as a separate ECS daemon service.
  - EC2 instance metrics: You still have normal EC2 metrics (CPU, network, etc.) in CloudWatch as for any instance. If a performance issue is suspected at host level (like high CPU steal, or low memory on host), check the EC2 metrics too.

  If metrics seem off (e.g., MemoryUtilization is 0 or not changing while you suspect high usage), consider that the service metric is average of all tasks. If one task is at 80% memory and another at 20%, the service average is 50%. So a spike in one container might be diluted. For finer granularity, Container Insights provides per-task and per-container metrics. In CloudWatch, under ECS > Cluster > Tasks, you can see metrics by task if Insights is on. If not using Insights, you can glean some info from Docker stats via SSH as a last resort.

- **CloudWatch Alarms and Events:** Set up alarms on critical metrics:

  - Example: Alarm on a high CPU for the service (sustained >80% for 5 minutes) to alert you that tasks might need scaling.
  - Memory alarm if near 100% (though note memory utilization in ECS is based on the defined hard limit, if your app is using all available container memory, that’s 100% – which might be fine if that’s expected, or it might precede an OOM).
  - You can also create alarms on ECS service deployment failures via CloudWatch Events / EventBridge rule. ECS emits events to EventBridge (e.g., `ECS Deployment State Change`). You could catch if a deployment fails and trigger an SNS notification. This is advanced but useful for alerting on things like “service failed to stabilize.”

- **AWS X-Ray (Distributed Tracing):** X-Ray is AWS’s distributed tracing solution, which is very useful for debugging performance issues or errors across services. In a microservice architecture, you might instrument each Java service with the X-Ray SDK. Key points for ECS:

  - **X-Ray Daemon/ADOT Collector**: The X-Ray SDK sends trace data to a local agent (UDP on port 2000 by default). In ECS, you need to run this agent. On EC2 launch type, you have two options:

    1. Run the X-Ray daemon as a **sidecar container** in each task. AWS provides a public image `amazon/aws-xray-daemon`. You include it in the task definition alongside your app. Ensure it’s in the same task (so it can access the same network). With awsvpc, both containers get the same ENI or you enable namespace sharing, or configure your app to send to the daemon's ENI IP. Simpler: enable network namespace sharing in the task and the daemon listens on 127.0.0.1 so the app can reach it. If not, set the daemon address in the X-Ray SDK to the daemon container’s IP.
    2. Run a **daemon per host** – you could run X-Ray daemon as a service with Daemon scheduling (one per EC2). It will listen on the host (e.g., 0.0.0.0:2000 UDP). If tasks are on bridge or host network, they can just send to host’s 127.0.0.1:2000. If tasks are awsvpc, the host’s 172.31.x.x IP might be reachable if you adjust settings. This is a bit trickier and usually the sidecar approach is easier to scope per service.

  - **Permissions:** The X-Ray daemon (or ADOT – AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry – collector if you use that) needs permission to upload traces to X-Ray service. If you run it as a sidecar in the task, you should attach a policy like **AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess** to the **task role** so that container can send data. If you run one per host, then the instance role should have that permission. Without this, the daemon will log errors that it cannot send data (you’d see that in its logs, accessible via CloudWatch if you route them or by exec into the daemon container).

  - **Instrumenting the Java App:** Use the AWS X-Ray SDK for Java or OpenTelemetry SDK to instrument your code. The X-Ray SDK can auto-patch some frameworks (like it can intercept AWS SDK calls, HTTP clients, etc.), but you might need to explicitly create segments or subsegments in your code around important operations. If using OpenTelemetry, you’d configure the collector to send to X-Ray; ADOT (AWS Distro for OTEL) has an integration where you run the ADOT collector as sidecar instead of X-Ray daemon. Either way, from ECS perspective, it’s just another container.

  - **Troubleshooting X-Ray:** If traces aren’t appearing in the X-Ray console:

    - Check the application logs – is it indicating any X-Ray initialization errors or UDP errors? If the SDK can’t reach the daemon, you might see warnings like “No segment received”.
    - Check the daemon container logs. Common messages: “Ignoring segment... cause: Throttled” or auth errors. If auth error, likely IAM permission missing. If no data at all, maybe the app never sent or couldn’t resolve the daemon address.
    - Ensure the daemon is running and listening. You can `netstat -lu` in the daemon container to see if UDP 2000 is open.
    - Remember that X-Ray traces require sampling. By default, X-Ray SDK samples the first X requests each second and 5% thereafter. If your service is low traffic, you might not hit the threshold to see a trace immediately. You can adjust the sampling rules to ensure you capture what you need (even 100% sampling in non-prod for debugging).
    - If using OpenTelemetry, ensure the collector config has an AWS X-Ray exporter and the SDK in Java is using OTLP to send to the collector.

  Once working, X-Ray will let you see a trace of requests through your services, which can greatly help identify latency issues or which downstream call caused a failure. It’s especially useful when a user request goes through multiple ECS services – you can see the end-to-end latency.

- **Other Tools (Third-party APM, Monitoring):** Many environments use tools like Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus, etc. to monitor ECS apps:

  - **Datadog**: often runs an agent on each host (or as a Fargate sidecar in Fargate’s case). For ECS EC2, you might run Datadog Agent as a DaemonSet (one per instance) via an ECS service with placement strategy `daemon`. That agent needs access to Docker or ECS Task metadata to scrape metrics. If not configured right, it might not find containers or might not submit data. Ensure the Datadog agent container has permission to ECS APIs (if using ECS integration) and the instance’s IAM role allows any needed CloudWatch reads (for gathering EC2 metrics if that’s how it’s set).
  - **Prometheus**: you might run Prometheus on EC2 or as pods in EKS (if hybrid). ECS can expose metrics via endpoints – e.g., your Java app might expose Micrometer/Prometheus metrics at `/actuator/prometheus`. You’d need a way to scrape that – either run a Prom container or sidecar to push metrics. Some use CloudWatch Container Insights as an intermediary (CW can collect custom metrics, which then could be graphed).
  - **Logging to Splunk/ELK**: If not using CloudWatch, ensure your alternative logging mechanism is robust. For example, logging to a file and having Filebeat on the host ship it. If logs are missing, verify the file path and mount configurations.

- **Container Insights and AWS CloudWatch Container Insights**: This is an AWS feature that gives you CPU, memory, disk, and network usage at the task level, plus diagnostic info like OOM events. For ECS EC2, enabling it involves running an agent on the instances (the CloudWatch agent with ECS integration). If set up, you’ll see metrics in CloudWatch under “ECS/ContainerInsights”. If not, consider enabling it for better visibility. If it’s enabled but not showing data, check the CloudWatch agent logs on the instance (usually in `/var/log/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/`). Perhaps the IAM permissions are missing (it needs to write metrics to CloudWatch). The agent requires `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy` or similar on the instance role.

In summary, **monitoring integration issues** often boil down to missing configuration or permissions. Always verify IAM roles for any agent or sidecar (CloudWatch agent, X-Ray, etc.) have the right policies. Use the logs of those agents (e.g., X-Ray daemon log will explicitly log if it can’t reach X-Ray service). The good news is these tools greatly aid in troubleshooting the other categories of problems: CloudWatch Logs for debugging, metrics for capacity issues, X-Ray for pinpointing slow microservice calls.

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline-Related Issues (CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

Deploying to ECS involves pushing container images to a registry and updating the ECS service/task definition. Many teams use CI/CD pipelines to automate this. However, pipeline missteps can lead to failed or incomplete deployments. Here we discuss common CI/CD issues for ECS:

- **CodePipeline & CodeDeploy (Blue/Green ECS Deployments):** AWS CodePipeline can deploy to ECS using two methods: directly updating the ECS service (as a deploy action) or via CodeDeploy for a blue/green deployment. Common issues:

  - **CodeDeploy without Load Balancer:** CodeDeploy’s blue/green for ECS requires that the ECS service be fronted by a load balancer (so it can shift traffic). If you attempt to use CodeDeploy blue/green without an LB, it will fail (by design, it’s not supported). The error would appear in CodeDeploy deployment logs. The solution is either attach an LB or instead do a rolling update (perhaps using CodePipeline’s ECS update action instead of CodeDeploy).
  - **AppSpec and Hooks:** In CodeDeploy for ECS, you need an AppSpec file (often appspec.yaml) that defines the ECS task set to deploy and optional Lambda hooks. A frequent issue is forgetting to update the AppSpec with the new task definition revision or image, leading CodeDeploy to redeploy the same thing. If CodeDeploy seems to deploy but nothing changes, check that your build pipeline is actually creating a new task definition revision (or at least new image with force update).
  - **Traffic Shift Issues:** Some have observed CodeDeploy flipping traffic before containers are healthy. If your new tasks aren’t fully ready, CodeDeploy might start sending traffic (depending on how you configured the termination wait time). Make sure the **ProdTrafficHook** Lambda (if any) and the settings align with your app needs. If you encounter _“Alarm Triggered”_ or deployment failed, CodeDeploy might have detected a CloudWatch alarm or a task set didn’t reach desired count. Investigate the CodeDeploy deployment logs (in console or via AWS CLI).
  - **Pipeline Permissions:** CodePipeline’s ECS deploy action and CodeDeploy actions run under a Service Role for CodePipeline. Ensure that role can call ECS APIs (like UpdateService) or CodeDeploy APIs. If not, the pipeline might fail with an IAM error (you’d see AccessDenied in pipeline logs).
  - **Artifact References:** If your pipeline build produces a new task definition file (JSON) and you use CodePipeline to push that, ensure it references the new image (new image tag or digest). A common scenario: using the same image tag “latest” each time without updating the task def revision number. ECS might not pull the new image if the tag is the same and imagePullPolicy isn’t always pull (Docker will cache “latest” unless you force). Best practice: version your images (e.g., use Git commit SHA in the tag) and update the task def with that tag on each deployment. This guarantees ECS pulls a new image. If you must use a static tag, consider adding the `--force-new-deployment` flag in `update-service` to force ECS to re-pull even if image hasn’t changed (CodePipeline’s ECS action has a checkbox for force new deployment).

- **GitHub Actions for ECS:** GitHub Actions can build and push Docker images and update ECS. There is an official AWS action for ECS deploy. Issues seen:

  - **Task definition not updated properly:** The AWS GitHub Action `amazon-ecs-render-task-definition` is often used to inject a new image into a task def JSON. If you mis-specify the container name or task def ARN, it can fail. For example, an error _“The container api-staging does not exist in the task definition”_ indicates that the container name given to the action didn’t match any container in the task definition. In one case, the workflow file had `container-name: api-staging` but the task def’s container was named `api-staging-jruby`. The action threw an InvalidParameterException. The fix was to use the correct container name in the action configuration. Double-check your workflow YAML against your task definition.
  - **Unsupported Deployment Controller:** There was an issue where the ECS GitHub Action started failing with _“Error: Unsupported deployment controller”_. This can happen if the ECS service is using an external deployment controller (like CodeDeploy blue/green) but the action tried to do a rolling update. Ensure that if your service uses CODE_DEPLOY or ECS deployment controller, you call the appropriate APIs. The AWS actions currently primarily handle ECS rolling updates. If using CodeDeploy, might need to switch to CLI calls or a different action.
  - **Wait for stability vs. Circuit Breaker:** By default, the AWS ECS deploy action waits for service stability (all tasks running and steady). If you have deployment circuit breaker on and a failure triggers a rollback, some older versions of the action might not properly report the failure – they’d see the service stable again (rolled back) and mark the action successful, even though the new deployment failed. Update to the latest actions version, as AWS addressed some of these edge cases. Alternatively, you can query service events after deployment in a script step to ensure no rollback occurred.
  - **GitHub Actions runner limitations:** If using self-hosted runners, ensure they have AWS CLI updated (if your pipeline uses CLI) and IAM credentials configured properly (often via `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`). A misconfigured AWS region or credentials will obviously cause failures (like cannot authenticate).

- **Jenkins Pipelines:** Jenkins can integrate with ECS in various ways (Jenkins can run workers as ECS tasks, or Jenkins deploys your app to ECS). For deploying applications:

  - Using AWS CLI in a Jenkinsfile is common. E.g., after building and pushing image to ECR, then:

    ```
    aws ecs register-task-definition --family my-task --container-definitions file://taskdef.json
    aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service my-service --task-definition my-task:123 --force-new-deployment
    ```

    A common issue is forgetting `--force-new-deployment` when using the same task def revision or same image tag – without it, if the task def ARN hasn’t changed, ECS might not redeploy anything because it sees no change. So always create a new task def revision or force deploy.

  - Jenkins credentials: Ensure the Jenkins agent or master has AWS credentials (access key env vars or an IAM role if running on an AWS instance with instance profile). If using an IAM user, rotate keys and update Jenkins credentials store regularly to avoid expiration issues.
  - If using the Jenkins AWS CodeDeploy plugin to trigger ECS deployments (some use CodeDeploy from Jenkins), double-check the AppSpec and deployment config as per CodeDeploy notes above.

- **Artifact and Image Versioning:** Many CI/CD issues for ECS boil down to not clearly versioning the artifacts:

  - Docker image tags – if you always tag “latest” and push, you might get in a state where ECS tasks are still running an old cached image. ECS on EC2 will respect the Docker pull policy: by default, if the image tag was seen before, Docker may use the cached image. ECS agent sets `--disable-immutable-image-caching` for certain scenarios or you can force by using image digest (which changes every build) or setting the task def image to `image:latest@sha256:...` which is a fixed immutable reference. If you notice your new code isn’t running after deployment, verify the image SHA of the running container (you can describe tasks or check on the instance via `docker inspect`). It might still be the old image if not pulled. Best fix is use unique tags per build.
  - Task Definition versions – each revision has a number. It’s good to keep track of which revision is deployed. If your pipeline registers a new task def each time, that increments. If pipeline fails in middle, you might have created a new revision but not updated the service to it, leaving unused revisions. Clean up old ones periodically if many accumulate (though they are just records, not big deal unless hundreds/thousands).

- **Blue/Green Gotchas with ECS and pipelines:** If you implement your own blue/green (like deploy a new ECS service alongside old, then swap traffic at ALB level manually), ensure you clean up properly. Sometimes people spin up a temporary service for new version, then switch DNS or ALB, then delete old service. If the pipeline fails after bringing up new but before switch, you might accidentally have two sets of tasks serving same traffic or double cost. Automation around blue/green must have good error handling to rollback (maybe use CodeDeploy to avoid reinventing the wheel).

- **Pulumi/Terraform/CloudFormation Deployments:** If your CI/CD uses Terraform or CloudFormation to deploy ECS, issues can include:

  - Terraform might try to replace an ECS service if certain immutable properties change (like changing from EC2 to Fargate launch type is a new resource). This could cause downtime if not planned. Watch the plan carefully.
  - If you use CloudFormation without CodeDeploy for ECS, stack updates will wait for the service to stabilize. If it fails, CloudFormation could rollback, _including_ rolling back the task definition change. The stack event might say “UPDATE_FAILED – ECS service did not reach stable state”. You’d need to check the reason (often health check failures as discussed). In such a case, CloudFormation will rollback to previous task def automatically (since it rolls back the whole stack). This can be confusing because your new image was never successfully deployed but you might not realize the stack rolled back unless you read events. So always verify the stack result and ECS service after a deployment.

- **Notifications:** It’s good practice to integrate notifications for pipeline failures. If CodePipeline fails, have an SNS or Slack notify. Similarly for GitHub Actions, use the GitHub notification or an action to send a Slack message. This ensures you’re aware of deployment problems early (which often are due to the above issues).

In essence, **CI/CD issues** often surface as “My new version didn’t deploy” or “Deployment pipeline failed at deploy step”. The remedy is to add checks in your pipeline for success (and if not, fail loudly), and to ensure each step (build, push, register, update) is doing what it should. For example, after updating service, the pipeline could call `aws ecs wait services-stable` to wait and then describe the service to ensure the desired task definition is running. If not, it can fail the pipeline for manual intervention. This kind of guard prevents silent failures where pipeline succeeds but app is not updated.

## 8. Troubleshooting Performance Issues (Latency, Throughput, Scaling)

Once your application is deployed and functional, you may encounter performance issues such as high latency in responses, throughput not meeting requirements, or scaling not behaving as expected. This section looks at how to diagnose and resolve these issues in the context of ECS and Java applications.

- **High Latency in Service Responses:** If users or monitoring detect that your service is responding slowly (higher response times), consider these angles:

  - **Application-Level Profiling:** Use APM tools or profilers (like X-Ray, JFR (Java Flight Recorder), Glowroot, etc.) to see where time is spent. It could be internal (e.g., GC pauses, slow database queries, locks) or waiting on external calls.
  - **Garbage Collection Pauses:** Long GC pauses can cause occasional latency spikes. Check GC logs or use X-Ray annotations (X-Ray can be configured to record metadata, you might log a custom subsegment around long operations). If you see Full GCs or many GCs, consider tuning heap (maybe increase heap if it’s too small and causing frequent GC) or tweak GC algorithm parameters. Tools like **GC Easy** or GC logs analysis can help understand if GC is a culprit.
  - **Thread Pools Saturated:** Many Java web servers use an executor pool for handling requests (Tomcat default max threads, etc.). If all threads are busy (perhaps waiting on slow I/O), new requests will queue and latency increases. Monitor the active thread count of your servlet container (e.g., Tomcat metrics) if possible. If you see it maxed out, perhaps you need a larger pool or to investigate why each request is slow.
  - **Database/Downstream Slowness:** Often latency issues are because the app is waiting on something else – a database call, an external API, etc. X-Ray traces or logging can pinpoint which external call is slow. If your app calls a database, check the DB performance (slow queries, missing indexes). If calling another service, maybe that service is slow (you might need to optimize that service or add caching).
  - **Network Latency:** If your ECS cluster is in, say, us-east-1 and you call an external API in Europe, network latency (transoceanic) will add to response time. Solution could be to deploy that component in a closer region or use caching/CDN if applicable. Within AWS, cross-AZ latency is low (milliseconds), cross-region higher (tens of ms). Ensure your ECS tasks and resources they frequently access (like a database) are in the same AZ or use AZ-aware services (Aurora Multi-AZ is fine; if using something like ElastiCache, ensure you’re connecting to the closest node).
  - **LB or Client Timeouts:** Sometimes an ALB or client might label your service as “slow” because it timed out. ALB’s default timeout is 60s for HTTP requests. If your responses take longer, ALB will drop the connection at 60s. If that’s happening, you see HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout errors. The fix is either increase the ALB timeout (if the operations legitimately need more time) or ideally optimize so it’s faster. For interactive user services, 60s is usually far too high anyway – aim for much less.

- **Throughput Limitations:** Suppose you expect your service to handle 1000 requests/sec but it caps around 200 req/sec. Possible reasons:

  - **CPU Bottleneck:** Check ECS service’s CPU usage. If it’s at 100% of the allocated CPU (or the EC2 host CPU is maxed out if tasks share host), the CPU might be limiting how many requests can be processed in parallel. If logs show all threads busy and CPU high, scale out (more tasks) or scale up (bigger instances or allocate more CPU units per task). You can tune Java’s `-XX:ParallelGCThreads` or other options, but generally if CPU is maxed, add capacity.
  - **Synchronized or Single-threaded code:** If the application has a part that is single-threaded (like a singleton that processes all requests serially, or a DB connection pool of size 1), that becomes a bottleneck. Inspect the code for such patterns. If found, refactor to allow parallelism (increase pool sizes, remove global locks). Using profiling tools can highlight if many threads are waiting on a lock.
  - **IO Bottleneck (Disk/Network):** If your service reads/writes large files (even to S3 or EFS), the network or disk throughput might throttle you. On EC2, each instance type has an EBS bandwidth limit – if tasks do heavy EBS I/O, you might be hitting that. CloudWatch metrics for the instance (NetworkBytes, DiskRead/WriteBytes) can show if you’re at cap. In Java, if you do a lot of network calls, ensure keep-alive is used, and consider connection pooling for HTTP clients (HTTPClient or okhttp, etc. with pool).
  - **Not Enough Instances or Tasks:** Perhaps each task can only handle X requests/sec due to the app design. Then to get higher throughput, you need more tasks (scaling out horizontally). ECS Service Auto Scaling can help here if you tie it to a metric like CPU or request count (via custom CloudWatch metric).
  - **Scaling Policy Tuning:** If your auto-scaling is in place but not responding quickly enough, you may see throughput suffer until scale catches up. For example, if scaling out has a cool-down that’s too long, it might not add tasks in time to handle a surge. Look at the CloudWatch metrics vs. scaling actions. If you see CPU high for a while before a new task launches, consider adjusting the target tracking threshold or cooldown. Also ensure the scaling has room (if you set max tasks too low, it hits a ceiling).
  - **Load Balancer or Client Limits:** ALB can handle a lot of traffic, but check if perhaps the client (like a test tool) is not actually sending more. If using something like JMeter or Locust, ensure the test isn’t the limiting factor. ALB metrics like RequestCount and TargetResponseTime can show how many requests are flowing. ALB can easily do thousands of requests/sec per target, so likely not an ALB issue unless you hit extremely high numbers or ran out of target instances.

- **Scaling (In/Out) Issues:** ECS Service Auto Scaling uses CloudWatch alarms or target tracking. Some common pitfalls:

  - **Scaling Out Delay:** You have an alarm for high CPU > 70%. CPU goes above 70% but new tasks take time (say tasks have to pull a big image or warm up). During that time, existing tasks might struggle. Mitigation: proactively scale out earlier (maybe set threshold 60% so it adds capacity before truly high load) or use **scheduled scaling** if you know traffic patterns (e.g., every day at noon scale out).
  - **Scaling In Aggressively:** Scale-in happens when load drops. But if it scales in too quickly, it might terminate tasks that were still handling some requests or just drops capacity that might be needed if traffic oscillates. AWS Auto Scaling has a default behavior: it won’t scale in during deployments, and after scale-out there’s a cool-down. Ensure you didn’t disable those. One user noted their service never scaled in; it turned out scale-in was disabled during a long deployment process and resumed after. So check that scale-in isn’t inadvertently blocked (other than the normal behavior).
  - **Task Placement Constraints:** If you use constraints like distinctInstance or memberOf, scaling might add tasks but not utilize all instances well. E.g., distinctInstance ensures each task is on a different instance – that limits scale-out if you don’t also scale out instances. If one instance fails, it can only place one task per instance, etc. Just ensure any constraints are truly needed.
  - **Cluster Capacity (EC2 Auto Scaling):** ECS can scale tasks beyond the current EC2 capacity if you let it – those tasks will remain pending. It’s crucial to link ECS Service scaling with EC2 Auto Scaling. This can be done with **Capacity Provider** and Auto Scaling groups. If not set, you might have scale-out events where ECS tries to run 10 tasks but you only have capacity for 5 – the rest remain pending until you manually add instances. Setting up a Capacity Provider with managed scaling will automatically trigger the Auto Scaling Group to add EC2s when tasks are pending (based on a target utilization of the cluster). Without it, you must monitor CloudWatch for “unable to place tasks” events and scale the instances. For robust scaling, definitely consider Capacity Providers for EC2 clusters.
  - **Cool-downs and Alarms:** If using step scaling with CloudWatch alarms, remember an alarm needs to reset before it can trigger again. If CPU spiked and triggered scale-out, then drops, the same alarm might not trigger another scale-out if needed soon after unless it goes below the threshold and then above again. Target Tracking is generally easier, as it aims for a target (like 50% CPU) and handles increment/decrement automatically.
  - **Metrics for scaling:** CPU and Memory are default. But sometimes they’re not the best proxy for load. E.g., your app might be I/O bound and CPU stays low even under heavy request load. In that case, CPU-based scaling won’t trigger. You might consider a custom metric like requests per second (if you have that from a load balancer or your app) or latency (scale out if p95 latency > X). You can push custom metrics via CloudWatch API from the app or a sidecar. That is advanced but could yield more responsive scaling.

- **Hardware/OS Level Issues:** With EC2, it’s rare but possible the underlying hardware has an issue (network card problems causing packet loss, etc.). If one instance consistently shows poor network throughput or other anomalies, consider replacing it (terminate to let ASG launch new). AWS also sometimes schedules maintenance on instances; if an instance is degrading, ECS might show it in **Container Instance Health** (ECS can mark instances as Draining if underlying hardware is bad in some managed scenarios).

- **Java-Specific Performance Tweaks:**

  - If using older versions of Java, upgrade – each version tends to improve performance. Java 17 or 21 have better GC, records (which can reduce memory overhead in some cases), etc.
  - Use JVM options appropriate for containers: e.g., `-XX:+UseStringDeduplication` can save memory if many duplicate strings, at slight CPU cost.
  - Adjust thread pool sizes for the number of CPUs you allocate. If your container has 2 vCPUs but Tomcat is using 200 threads, that might be overkill; a smaller pool might actually perform better due to less context switching (unless those threads are mostly idle waiting on I/O).
  - Consider using **asynchronous I/O** in the app where possible (e.g., use NIO or reactive programming) to handle more concurrent requests with fewer threads, which can improve throughput on I/O-heavy loads.

- **Load Testing and Capacity Planning:** If possible, simulate load on a test environment to find where the bottlenecks are. This way you can adjust scaling or code before real traffic hits limits. Use tools like Gatling, JMeter, or even AWS’s own Distributed Load Testing solution to generate traffic. Monitor ECS behavior under stress – does it scale as expected? Does any task OOM under high load? Are response times acceptable? This proactive approach can surface issues like “with 100 concurrent users, memory usage grows steadily” – maybe indicating a memory leak that only shows under heavy concurrency.

To troubleshoot performance, it often requires **monitoring at multiple levels**: application logs (for errors/timeouts), application metrics (for internal stats like DB query time, thread counts), container metrics (CPU, memory), and infrastructure (EC2 metrics, ALB metrics). Using the tools covered in section 6 (CloudWatch, X-Ray, etc.) in concert will give a holistic picture. For example, you might correlate a spike in latency with a spike in GC time via CloudWatch Logs Insights by searching GC log events, or correlate high CPU with specific request patterns via X-Ray.

## 9. Log Management, Anomaly Detection, and Alerting Strategies

As your ECS-deployed Java application runs, ongoing log management and proactive alerting are crucial for maintaining reliability. In this section, we discuss how to manage logs, detect anomalies, and set up alerts for your containerized services.

- **Centralized Log Management:** We covered CloudWatch Logs configuration in section 6. To reiterate:

  - **Structure logs for analysis:** It’s beneficial to output logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON) rather than plain text. Many logging frameworks (Log4j2, Logback) can be configured to output JSON. This makes it easier to use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query logs (you can parse JSON fields in queries). For example, you could quickly filter logs for a specific userId or error code if those are fields in your JSON log events.
  - **Log Retention:** By default, CloudWatch Logs retain forever. Set an appropriate retention (maybe 30 days, 90 days) to control costs, unless you need indefinite retention for compliance. This can be done on the log group settings. Old logs beyond that are automatically deleted.
  - **Splitting Log Streams:** In CloudWatch, each task (container) will have its own log stream. When analyzing, you often want to aggregate across streams. Logs Insights can do that with a query that spans the log group. Alternatively, you might push all application logs to a single stream by configuring the driver with the same stream name, but that’s not recommended if tasks run in parallel (they’d interleave and also contention on one stream).
  - **Third-party Log Services:** If you use Splunk, Elastic Stack (ELK), or others: AWS provides FireLens (an ECS logging feature) that can route logs to external systems using Fluent Bit. FireLens can run a Fluent Bit sidecar per task that ships logs out to various destinations. If CloudWatch isn’t your primary log store, consider FireLens. It requires setting up a FireLens config and an extra container in the task def. Alternatively, run a daemon on each EC2 instance that tails `/var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log` and sends to your logging system. Just ensure whatever method, it handles log rotation and doesn’t consume too many resources on the instance.

- **Anomaly Detection on Metrics:** AWS CloudWatch has an **Anomaly Detection** feature for metrics. It uses machine learning to model the normal range of a metric and can alarm when the metric deviates from that range. This can be useful for catching unusual patterns that static thresholds might miss. For example:

  - Enable anomaly detection on CPUUtilization of your service. CloudWatch will train on past data (you should have some history) and then you can create an alarm that triggers if CPU goes outside the expected band. This might catch sudden spikes or drops that are not typical (which could indicate, say, a runaway process or a crash loop causing low CPU).
  - Similarly on memory or request count metrics. An anomaly alarm on request count could detect a sudden traffic surge (possibly an attack or bug causing excessive calls) or a sudden drop (maybe an upstream outage so no traffic is coming).

  Some caveats: anomaly detection might need a stable baseline or repeated patterns (daily cycle, weekly cycle) to be effective. If your usage is very irregular or constantly growing, a static threshold might be simpler. Also, you cannot use anomaly detection on metrics that are just math expressions combining others (direct metrics only).

  Aside from CloudWatch, external monitoring tools often have anomaly detection or alerting based on deviation. For instance, Datadog has outlier detection monitors. These are worth using for critical metrics like latency p95, error rate, etc., as they can alert you to issues like “error rate suddenly doubled” which a static >X% threshold might not catch if X is set too high or low.

- **Alerting on Logs (Anomaly and Patterns):** CloudWatch Logs doesn’t natively have anomaly detection on log patterns, but you can set up metric filters. For example, you can create a metric filter on your log group for occurrences of the word “ERROR” in logs, and have it increment a custom CloudWatch metric. Then set an alarm if the count of “ERROR” messages exceeds some threshold in 5 minutes. This at least tells you if error logs spiked. For more advanced log analytics:

  - Consider using **CloudWatch Logs Insights** scheduled queries (though currently, CloudWatch doesn’t directly alert from an Insights query result – you’d have to run it via Lambda on a schedule and send to SNS if criteria met).
  - Third-party log services often have alerting (e.g., Kibana watchers, Splunk alerts) where you can set a condition on log frequency or specific message patterns.
  - Amazon has a service called **DevOps Guru** which can analyze CloudWatch metrics and in some cases logs to detect anomalies. As of 2025, DevOps Guru supports various AWS services including some container insights. It might be worth exploring for a high-level anomaly detection across the stack – but it’s more of a general ops analysis tool and may not catch app-specific issues that you know to look for.

- **Important Metrics and Alerts for ECS Java Apps:**

  - **Application Error Rate:** If you expose a metric for the number of 5xx responses (if it’s a web API) or count of exceptions, set an alarm if that goes above a certain threshold. You might instrument this via CloudWatch embedded metrics (the Java SDK can put custom metrics, or use X-Ray which can be configured to mark traces as error/fault and then you see that in X-Ray analytics).
  - **Memory Utilization High:** An alarm if any task’s memory usage approaches the hard limit, say >90%. This could catch memory leaks before they OOM kill. However, to get per-task memory in CloudWatch, you need Container Insights. Alternatively, you could push a custom metric from the app (e.g., expose JMX memory used via CloudWatch).
  - **Task OOM Events:** There isn’t a direct metric for “OOMKill occurred”, but you can catch it via events or logs. One approach: set CloudWatch Logs filter for “OutOfMemoryError” text in the ECS agent log group or in your application logs. Or use the ECS event stream – when a task dies due to OOM, ECS will have the stopped reason. You could create an EventBridge rule on pattern: `detail-stopCode: "OutOfMemoryError"` or the reason contains “memory”. Then trigger an SNS or Lambda to notify. This gets you immediate alert when a task was killed by OOM.
  - **Scaling Limits:** An alert if your service is at 100% of desired count and still under high load – implying it scaled to max but might need a higher cap or bigger instances. Essentially, if `DesiredCount == MaxCapacity` and CPU is >80% for 5 minutes, perhaps alert that “Service X is maxed out scaling”.
  - **Cluster Capacity:** Similarly, an alarm on ECS Cluster if the reservation is too high. ECS cluster metrics can show how much CPU/mem is reserved vs available. If available drops to 0 and tasks are pending, you need more instances. Set an alarm on low available memory in cluster.
  - **Latency and Throughput KPIs:** If your SLA is, say, 95% of requests under 200ms, set up an alarm if p95 latency > 200ms for 5 mins. ALB provides percentile latency metrics if you enable them (but ALB latency includes network overhead; you might instrument at app level for more accurate).
  - **Scheduled Task Failures:** If you run ECS scheduled tasks (like cron jobs in ECS), ensure you monitor their exit codes. CloudWatch Events can trigger on a failed task. For a Java batch container, you might have it exit non-zero on failure. Capture that via EventBridge rule on task stop status, and alert the team with context (perhaps the logs).

- **Using AWS EventBridge for Anomaly Detection:** A neat approach is to use EventBridge with pattern matching. For example, you can get ECS events for task state changes, service deploys, etc. You could make a rule: if service deployment fails or if task stops unexpectedly, send to an SNS topic that emails the on-call. This is more discrete-event based than anomaly, but helps catch issues that metrics might not. Also, CloudWatch Alarms themselves can notify directly via SNS, which you can hook to email or incident management systems.

- **Response to Alerts (Runbooks):** It’s not enough to have alerts; have runbooks for each alert. E.g., if alert “MemoryUtilization > 90%”, the runbook might say: “Check ECS service events for OOM, login to instance and run top to see process usage, consider increasing task memory or look for memory leak in logs.” Over time, automate responses where possible. For instance, if an instance is unhealthy (maybe detected via ECS agent disconnect alarm), you might automate a replacement (ASG can handle to some extent, but you can trigger a Lambda to drain and terminate it).

- **Auto-Healing Mechanisms:** ECS will automatically restart failed tasks (if part of a service). But for other issues like a stuck deployment or a hung ECS agent, consider automation:

  - Use AWS Health APIs or CloudWatch to detect if an EC2 in cluster is impaired, and set it to DRAIN (ECS has an API to set container instance to DRAINING, which moves tasks off it) and then terminate.
  - If memory leak is known issue, maybe schedule a task restart nightly (not ideal but a workaround until fixed).
  - Leverage AWS Fault Injection Simulator to test how your system reacts to failures, then improve your alerting and auto-healing accordingly.

- **Audit and Logging for Security:** In addition to performance and reliability, consider enabling AWS CloudTrail for ECS and ECR. This will log when deployments happen, who did them, if anyone changed a task role, etc. If an anomaly in behavior is due to a deployment you weren’t aware of, CloudTrail can help you discover that.

In sum, robust logging and monitoring will often surface issues before they become outages. Combine **metric alarms** (for quantifiable thresholds) with **anomaly detection** (for pattern deviations) and **log-based alerts** (for specific error conditions) for comprehensive coverage. The goal is to be notified of problems (or impending problems) in your ECS Java app automatically, so you can respond or even self-heal. Many of the topics earlier in this guide (memory leaks, failing health checks, etc.) can be caught via these mechanisms – e.g., an alert on “task replaced due to health check” could lead you to Section 5 of this guide.

## 10. Real-World Case Studies and Example Scenarios

To solidify the concepts, let's walk through a few **real-world scenarios** that illustrate troubleshooting containerized Java applications on ECS (EC2 launch type). These case studies combine multiple issues and show how they were identified and resolved.

**Case Study 1: Memory Leak Causing Task Restarts**
**Scenario:** A Java Spring Boot service is running on ECS with 2GB hard memory limit. After a day of uptime under load, the service becomes slow and eventually the task is killed and restarted by ECS. This repeats daily.
**Observation:** Looking at ECS service events, we see messages like _“service myapp (port 8080) is unhealthy in target-group … (reason: Task failed ELB health checks)”_ followed by _“task stopped due to OutOfMemoryError: Container killed due to memory usage”_. In CloudWatch, memory utilization for the task climbs steadily to 100% over several hours. The application logs show increasing GC frequency and finally an `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` before the abrupt termination.
**Troubleshooting:** We suspected a memory leak. We enabled heap dump on OOM (`-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`) and configured an ECS volume to persist the dump to S3 (using a sidecar container to upload it on start-up of new task). Analyzed the heap dump with Eclipse MAT and found a large number of lingering user session objects in memory that should have been cleaned. It turned out a caching mechanism in the app wasn’t evicting entries. Meanwhile, as a stop-gap, we increased the task’s memory to 3GB and reduced `Xmx` to 2.5GB (to give headroom) to prevent immediate restarts.
**Resolution:** The development team fixed the caching logic to properly evict entries, eliminating the leak. After redeployment, memory usage stabilized around 60% and did not continuously grow. Additionally, we set up a CloudWatch alarm on memory usage >90% and an EventBridge rule to notify on any `OutOfMemoryError` stopped… on any `OutOfMemoryError` stopped task event. This case showed how correlating ECS events (OutOfMemoryError) with application logs and heap analysis pinpointed a memory leak and guided both a short-term mitigation (more memory) and a long-term fix (code change).

**Case Study 2: IAM Role Misconfiguration Blocking AWS Access**
**Scenario:** A containerized Java application needs to download files from S3 during startup. It’s deployed on ECS and configured with an IAM Task Role that supposedly grants S3 read access. However, on deploy, the container kept failing immediately. The ECS task stopped with exit code 1, and in the container’s log we saw an exception: _`AccessDenied: Access Denied (Service: S3, Status Code: 403)`_. ECS service events just showed “Essential container exited” with no further info.
**Observation:** We inspected the IAM roles. The Task Role had the correct S3 permissions, but the developer had stored the S3 bucket credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and configured the ECS Task Definition to inject them as environment variables via a secret. The application was failing before even attempting S3 because it couldn’t retrieve the secret (which contained an API key for a third-party service, in this case). In the ECS **stopped task** reason we found a clue: _“unable to retrieve secret… AccessDeniedException”_. This indicated the **Task Execution Role** lacked permission for Secrets Manager. The error was buried in the ECS event log, showing the execution role was not authorized to `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`. The team had mistakenly put the SecretsManager permission on the Task Role instead of the Execution Role.
**Troubleshooting:** Once we realized there were two separate roles at play (task vs execution role), we updated the Execution Role to include the needed secret access. We redeployed the service. This time, the secret was pulled successfully (confirmed in ECS agent logs) and the application started, but then it still hit an _AccessDenied_ when calling S3. This was puzzling because the Task Role had S3 permissions. Eventually, we discovered the root cause: the application was using the AWS default credentials provider chain, which in ECS includes the Task Role credentials – that part was fine – **but** the code was trying to list objects in an S3 bucket in a different AWS account which the role didn’t have access to (an oversight in cross-account access). We saw in CloudTrail that the S3 AccessDenied was because resource policy denied it. This was a separate issue, but the key learning was the initial failure was due to the secret fetching.
**Resolution:** We fixed the IAM roles: added `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the execution role for that secret’s ARN, and corrected the S3 bucket policy to allow the ECS task role from our account. After that, the startup succeeded and the app could fetch its S3 files. This case highlights the importance of distinguishing the ECS task role vs execution role and ensuring each has appropriate permissions. It also reinforced checking the full error message in ECS events – had we not scrolled through the long error, we might have chased the wrong cause (thinking it was purely S3 when it was secrets access first).

**Case Study 3: Misconfigured Health Check and Port Causing Deployment Failure**
**Scenario:** An ECS service was running a Java-based API on port 8080 behind an Application Load Balancer. A new version of the application was released which, due to a containerization change, was now listening on port 9090 (the Dockerfile EXPOSE and Spring Boot server.port were updated to 9090). The ECS task definition was updated to reflect container port 9090, but the team forgot to update the ALB target group’s health check and the security group. During deployment, the new tasks kept getting marked unhealthy and the service rolled back (deployment circuit breaker was enabled).
**Observation:** ECS service events showed: _“target group health check failed for target ip ...:8080”_ and _“service myapi deployment failed to stabilize”_. That was odd because we thought it should check 9090. It turned out the ECS service’s load balancer configuration was still pointing to container port 8080 (a parameter in the ECS service definition). So it was registering the new task on port 8080, which the container wasn’t actually listening on – hence no response to health check and immediate unhealthy status. Additionally, the security group on the tasks only allowed the ALB to access port 8080. The ALB was actually sending health requests to 8080 and getting connection refused. We confirmed by looking at the ALB Target Group screen, which listed the targets on port 8080 and showed them unhealthy.
**Troubleshooting:** The solution came in multiple steps:

1. We updated the ECS service to use the correct container port 9090 for the load balancer mapping. In CloudFormation, this meant changing the listener rule to point to 9090 and the ECS service’s targetGroup container port to 9090.
2. We adjusted the security group on the ECS tasks to allow traffic from the ALB SG on port 9090 (previously only 8080 was open).
3. We also updated the Target Group’s health check path. Previously, it was hitting “/health” which in the new app version required authentication (another oversight). We changed it to “/actuator/health/basic” which was an open endpoint. We did this because CloudWatch Insights of the container logs showed 401 responses to health check pings.
   After these fixes, we redeployed. The new tasks came up, the ALB health checks on 9090 succeeded (HTTP 200), and ECS marked the deployment successful. We verified in service events that the target registration used port 9090 this time (four places to update port were aligned: Docker image, task def, service config, SG).
   **Resolution:** The deployment succeeded and traffic was routed to the new version. This case illustrates how a small misconfiguration (port mismatch and health check auth) can cascade into a full deployment failure. It reinforced our process to double-check port settings in **all** relevant places and to use distinct port numbers in dev/staging to catch such issues early. We also improved our runbooks: when seeing health check failures, immediately verify container port alignment and try hitting the health URL manually (which would have revealed the 401 Unauthorized in this case).

**Case Study 4: Networking Issue – Tasks Unable to Pull Images in Private Subnet**
**Scenario:** In a development environment, an ECS cluster was set up in a new VPC with only private subnets (no internet access). The team ran a deployment, but tasks failed to launch with the error **“CannotPullContainerError: i/o timeout”** when trying to fetch the image from Docker Hub.
**Observation:** The error clearly indicated a network timeout pulling the image. The EC2 instances had no public IPs and no NAT Gateway in the subnet. For production, images were in ECR and VPC Endpoints were planned, but in this dev case, they were pulling a public image (httpd:2.4 as a test) from Docker Hub without egress to the internet.
**Troubleshooting:** The solution was straightforward: we created a NAT Gateway in one of the public subnets and updated the private subnet route table to send 0.0.0.0/0 to NAT. Alternatively, we could have added VPC endpoints for ECR and used an ECR image. Once the NAT Gateway was in place, new tasks could pull the image successfully.
**Resolution:** The tasks transitioned to RUNNING. The lesson was that ECS on EC2 doesn’t magically bypass network restrictions – you must have proper egress. The error message was a strong hint (dial tcp timeout to an AWS ECR endpoint). We implemented this fix in dev and ensured our production VPC had either NAT or all necessary VPC endpoints (for ECR, S3, etc.) to allow ECS operations in isolated subnets.

_(The above case studies are based on typical scenarios. They demonstrate a methodical approach: correlating ECS events, container logs, and AWS service logs to zero in on root causes, then applying targeted fixes.)_

## Conclusion

Troubleshooting ECS deployments of Java applications can be complex, but by breaking down the problem across layers – application, container, ECS service, and infrastructure – you can methodically identify and resolve issues. We began by addressing common ECS deployment pitfalls like image pulls, resource limits, and configuration errors that prevent tasks from starting. We delved into container-level concerns such as JVM memory management, explaining how to detect memory leaks and tune the JVM for container environments. We explored ECS-specific problems including interpreting service events, understanding the critical distinction between task role and execution role, and diagnosing health check failures and load balancer interactions.

Networking and security issues were addressed, emphasizing proper VPC, ENI, and security group setups to ensure connectivity between services and external resources. We highlighted how misconfigurations (like a wrong port or missing NAT Gateway) manifest as timeouts or refused connections and how to remedy them. Load balancing was another focus – we saw how to align health checks, target group settings, and container behavior so that ECS deployments roll out smoothly without getting stuck in a retry loop.

Integration with CloudWatch and X-Ray was covered to stress the importance of observability. By shipping logs to CloudWatch and setting up alarms (and even anomaly detection), one can catch issues early – whether it’s an uptick in error logs or unusual latency. X-Ray provides insight into distributed traces, which is invaluable for pinpointing slowness in microservices. We also examined CI/CD pipelines (CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, Jenkins), noting that ensuring the pipeline updates the ECS service correctly (with proper image tags, task definitions, and waiting for stability) is key to avoiding partial or failed deployments.

Performance troubleshooting was addressed through understanding scaling (both at the ECS service level and the cluster level) and examining the application’s runtime profile. We discussed how to investigate high CPU, memory, and latency scenarios using the available tools and metrics, and adjust scaling policies or application code accordingly.

Throughout this guide, a common theme is **visibility**: leveraging ECS event messages, CloudWatch metrics, and application logs to form a complete picture of the system’s state. When an ECS-deployed Java app has an issue, it often leaves clues in multiple places – an error message in a log, a pattern in metrics, or an event in the ECS console. By piecing these together (as demonstrated in the case studies), you can isolate the root cause and apply the appropriate fix, whether it’s as simple as opening a port in a security group or as involved as fixing a memory leak in code.

In advanced DevOps scenarios, you’ll also automate many of these troubleshooting steps. For example, you might have scripts or Lambdas that automatically gather logs and metrics when a deployment fails, or even auto-remediate known issues (like replace a bad instance or rollback on critical error rates). ECS integrates with many other AWS services to enable such automation (EventBridge for event-driven actions, CodeDeploy for automated rollback, etc.). Taking advantage of these can improve reliability and reduce time-to-recovery.

Finally, always incorporate the lessons from incidents back into your monitoring and deployment processes. If an issue wasn’t caught early, ask “how can we detect this sooner next time?” – perhaps add a new CloudWatch alarm or log alert. If a misconfiguration caused a failure, improve your Infrastructure as Code or checklists to prevent it in the future. Over time, this iterative improvement will harden your ECS deployments.

Armed with the detailed knowledge from this guide, you should be well-equipped to troubleshoot and resolve most issues encountered when running Java applications in Docker containers on Amazon ECS with EC2 launch type. Happy deploying, and may your ECS services be ever stable and your logs ever insightful!
