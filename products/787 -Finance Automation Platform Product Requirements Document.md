# Finance Automation Platform – Product Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Finance Automation Platform is an integrated solution designed to streamline and optimize an organization’s financial operations across accounts payable (AP), accounts receivable (AR), payments, and related workflows. This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the vision, features, and requirements for the platform’s **20 key features**, serving as a comprehensive guide for product managers, engineers, designers, and QA teams involved in its development.

**Background & Rationale:** Many companies today still rely on manual, paper-based financial processes, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and compliance risks. For example, an estimated _75% of U.S. invoices are paper-based_, and _80% of firms still use paper checks_ for supplier payments. Manual invoice handling is costly and slow – nearly _40% of invoices contain errors_ and the average invoice takes _14.6 days_ to process without automation. This not only drives up operational costs (manual processing can cost \$15–\$20 per invoice, versus \$2–\$4 with automation) but also strains supplier relationships due to delays and mistakes. Similarly, in AR, slow invoicing and collections lead to cash flow challenges; companies that have automated AR processes have seen Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) drop by over _30% (about 19 days)_ on average. These statistics underscore the urgent need for a unified platform to digitize and automate finance operations, thereby improving efficiency, accuracy, and financial control.

**Product Vision:** The Finance Automation Platform aims to be a **single, end-to-end solution** that automates financial workflows, reduces manual effort, and provides real-time visibility into financial health. By consolidating AP, AR, payment processing, and financial analytics in one system, the platform will eliminate silos and data re-entry, ensure compliance with accounting standards and regulations, and empower finance teams to focus on strategic tasks. The ultimate objective is to **increase operational efficiency** (e.g., process invoices and payments significantly faster), **reduce errors and fraud risks** (through validation and controls), and **improve cash flow management** (through timely collections and insightful forecasting).

**Scope of This Document:** This PRD covers the requirements for the platform’s core features, each of which addresses a critical aspect of finance automation. For each feature, we detail:

- **Feature Overview & Objective:** A description of what the feature does and the business value it delivers.
- **User Stories & Use Cases:** Specific scenarios illustrating how end-users (e.g., AP clerks, finance managers, CFOs, etc.) will use the feature to achieve their goals.
- **Functional Requirements:** The capabilities that the feature must support to fulfill the user stories (i.e., what the system should do).
- **Technical Requirements:** Key technical considerations and constraints (i.e., how the system should be built or perform, including performance, scalability, and reliability criteria).
- **Integration Considerations:** How the feature should interact with external systems or modules (e.g., ERP software, banking systems, third-party services).
- **UI/UX Notes:** Design and usability expectations (workflow, layout, and any important UI elements or wireframe ideas) to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Security & Compliance Needs:** Requirements to protect data, enforce permissions, and comply with relevant laws/regulations (e.g., SOX, GDPR, IRS rules, PCI DSS).
- **KPIs & Success Metrics:** How we will measure the feature’s success and impact (e.g., efficiency gains, error reduction, user adoption metrics).

**Target Audience:** The document is written primarily for **Product Managers** guiding the development of the platform. However, it is also intended to align cross-functional teams – **Engineering** (for implementation guidance), **Design/UX** (for understanding user flows), and **Quality Assurance** (for preparing test scenarios) – on what needs to be built and why. Each feature section can be treated as a standalone module, but together they form a cohesive product designed to modernize financial operations.

**Modular Organization:** The platform’s features are modular, meaning each can be developed and delivered somewhat independently, while still working seamlessly together. This document is organized by feature module for clarity. Below is an overview of the features covered:

## 1. Accounts Payable Automation

### Feature Overview and Objective

**Overview:** The Accounts Payable (AP) Automation feature streamlines the entire invoice-to-payment process for supplier invoices. It replaces manual invoice handling (paper shuffling, data entry, manual approvals) with a digital workflow that **captures invoices, routes them for approval, and executes payments** automatically. The objective is to reduce invoice processing time and costs, eliminate human errors (like data entry mistakes or lost invoices), and ensure vendors are paid accurately and on time. By automating AP, the organization can avoid late payment fees, take advantage of early payment discounts, and maintain better supplier relationships through timely, transparent payments.

**Objective:** This feature aims to achieve an efficient, **“touchless” invoice processing workflow** wherever possible. Invoices received from various sources (email, uploads, or vendor portal) will be automatically captured and coded. The system will perform validations (e.g., matching invoices to purchase orders or past payments to catch duplicates) and then route each invoice through a predefined approval workflow. Once approved, the invoice is scheduled for payment via the appropriate method. The end goals are to **minimize manual intervention**, improve financial control (every invoice is tracked and approved per policy), and provide real-time visibility into outstanding payables and cash requirements. Success for this feature means reducing the average processing time per invoice dramatically (for instance, from multiple days to same-day processing) and cutting the cost per invoice by automating repetitive tasks.

### Detailed User Stories and Use Cases

- **User Story (AP Clerk):** As an AP Clerk, I want to quickly input or import supplier invoices into the system so that I no longer have to manually transcribe invoice data.
- **User Story (AP Clerk):** As an AP Clerk, I want the system to **automatically extract key invoice details** (vendor name, invoice number, date, line items, amounts, etc.) from uploaded invoices (PDFs or images) so that I spend less time on data entry.
- **User Story (AP Clerk):** As an AP Clerk, I want the system to flag potential **duplicate invoices** or invoice discrepancies (e.g. total doesn’t match purchase order, or an invoice with the same number was already recorded) so that we don’t accidentally pay the same bill twice or pay an incorrect amount.
- **User Story (AP Manager):** As an AP Manager, I want to define **approval rules** (e.g., invoices over \$5,000 require my approval or CFO approval) so that large or sensitive payments get proper oversight in compliance with our financial policies.
- **User Story (AP Manager):** As an AP Manager, I want to easily review pending invoice approvals in one dashboard, with the ability to drill into each invoice’s image and details, so that I can make informed approval decisions quickly.
- **User Story (Department Manager/Approver):** As a Department Manager (approver), I want to receive a notification (email or in-app) when an invoice for my department or project is awaiting my approval, and I want to approve or reject it with a clear justification so that I can keep the process moving even when I’m away from my desk.
- **User Story (CFO):** As a CFO (or Finance Director), I want an overview of all outstanding payables and recently approved invoices, with metrics like total pending payments, cycle times, and any exceptions, so that I have confidence that our liabilities are under control and can manage cash flow accordingly.
- **User Story (Vendor):** As a Vendor (external use case), I want to be notified when my invoice is approved and scheduled for payment, or be able to check the payment status via a portal, so that I have transparency and trust in the payment process.
- **User Story (Internal Auditor):** As an Internal Auditor, I want to see an audit trail of each invoice’s processing (when it was received, who approved it, when it was paid), so that I can verify compliance with internal controls and policies.

### Functional Requirements

- **Invoice Capture & OCR:** The system shall support multiple invoice capture methods: uploading PDF/image files, automated ingestion from a dedicated AP email inbox, and (future) integration with e-invoicing networks. Upon receiving an invoice, the system should apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or AI-based data extraction to automatically populate invoice fields (date, invoice #, vendor, line item details, totals, tax, etc.) with at least 90-95% accuracy for standard invoice formats.
- **Invoice Validation:** The system shall validate extracted invoice data. This includes detecting missing or malformed fields (e.g., invoice date in the future), verifying that the invoice number is not a duplicate of one already in the system (for the same vendor), and checking that totals sum up correctly from line items. If a validation fails, the invoice should be flagged for manual review with a clear error message.
- **PO Matching:** For invoices associated with purchase orders (PO), the system shall attempt a **2-way or 3-way match**. It should match invoice line items against the corresponding PO and, if available, goods receipt data. Discrepancies (e.g., quantity billed > received, price mismatches) should trigger an exception workflow where AP clerks can review and reconcile differences or escalate to a buyer for resolution.
- **Approval Workflow:** The system shall route invoices to approvers based on configurable rules. Administrators or AP Managers must be able to define rules such as: by invoice amount thresholds, by department or project code (e.g., invoices charged to a certain department go to that manager), or by vendor category. The workflow engine should support multiple sequential approvers (e.g., Manager approval then Finance Director approval for very large invoices) as well as parallel approvals if needed. Approvers should be able to approve or reject with comments, and the system should notify the next approver or return to AP with rejection notes accordingly.
- **Notifications & Reminders:** The system shall send automated notifications to approvers when an invoice is awaiting their approval. Reminder notifications should be sent if an invoice sits unapproved for more than a set SLA (e.g., 3 days) to prevent bottlenecks. AP clerks should also be alerted if an invoice is rejected or requires additional info.
- **Invoice Edit & Coding:** AP staff should be able to edit or add coding to the invoice data before approval (e.g., assign GL account codes, cost centers, or splits across departments) in an intuitive interface. The system should maintain version history when changes are made to invoice records.
- **Payment Scheduling:** Once an invoice is fully approved, the system shall support scheduling it for payment. This could involve pushing the invoice to the **Payments module** (see _Multiple Payment Methods_ feature) with the designated pay date (e.g., on the invoice due date or earlier if capturing discounts). The AP manager can also override and schedule urgent payments immediately if needed (with appropriate permissions).
- **Exceptions Handling:** The system must provide a way to handle exceptions such as disputed invoices or partial payments. For example, if only part of an invoice is approved for payment (due to a dispute on certain line items), the system should allow partial payment and track the remaining balance as pending resolution. Credit notes or vendor refunds should also be supported, linking to the original invoice.
- **Vendor Database Integration:** The platform should maintain a master vendor list (or integrate with an external ERP’s vendor master). When capturing an invoice, the system should recognize the vendor (e.g., by name or vendor ID on invoice) and link it to the master record. If an invoice comes from an unknown vendor, it should flag it and allow adding a new vendor record (with appropriate validations, e.g., requiring a tax ID or W-9 if domestic vendor, see _1099 & W-9 Management_).
- **Audit Trail:** Every action on an invoice (data extracted, fields edited, approvals given, payment scheduled or made) shall be logged with timestamp, user, and action details. This log must be easily accessible for auditing purposes.
- **Reporting & KPIs:** The AP module should provide basic reporting on invoice processing – e.g., number of invoices processed per week, average approval time, number of invoices pending approval, etc. (Some of these will feed into the overall **Insights & Analytics Dashboards** feature.) It should also be possible to export invoice data and audit trails for audit or analysis.

### Technical Requirements

- **Scalability & Performance:** The AP Automation system should handle a high volume of invoices, e.g., up to **1000 invoices per hour** during peak times, without significant performance degradation. The OCR/data extraction component should process a typical invoice in under \~30 seconds, and the overall end-to-end processing (from invoice upload to ready-for-approval state) should typically occur within 1-2 minutes for electronic invoices. The system should support simultaneous users (AP clerks and approvers) without slowdown, targeting a sub-second response time for pulling up an invoice entry or list.
- **Accuracy & Machine Learning:** The OCR engine or data extraction algorithm should be configurable and trainable. Over time, as the system processes more invoices, it should learn from corrections (e.g., if users repeatedly fix a certain vendor’s invoice field, the system improves recognition for that vendor template). The target data extraction accuracy is at least 95% for critical fields. The system may integrate a third-party OCR/AI service if needed, but it must meet security requirements for data handling.
- **System Integration Architecture:** The AP module should be built with an API-first approach. Key events (invoice received, approved, paid) should be exposed via webhooks or APIs so that external systems (like an ERP or a procurement system) can be notified or pull data. Likewise, the module should consume APIs for integration (for instance, retrieving PO data from an ERP for matching, or sending payment instructions to a bank interface). Data exchange should be in secure formats (e.g., JSON over HTTPS for APIs, SFTP for any batch file transfers if needed).
- **Data Security & Encryption:** All invoice images and data must be stored securely. Documents should be stored in an encrypted storage, and sensitive fields (like bank account numbers on invoices or tax IDs) should be encrypted at rest in the database. Data in transit (between the user’s browser and the server, or between the platform and external systems) must use TLS encryption.
- **Permission Controls:** The system should enforce that only authorized roles can perform certain actions (e.g., only AP clerks can edit invoice details, only approvers can approve, only managers can override payments). These roles and permissions are defined under the _Dual Control & User Role Management_ feature but must be respected by the AP workflows.
- **Reliability & Error Handling:** In case of OCR failures or system errors, the invoice should not be lost. The system should queue and retry operations like data extraction if a service is temporarily down. Any unprocessed invoices or errors should trigger alerts to the AP team. The goal is to ensure no invoice falls through the cracks (zero lost or untracked invoices, aligning to the stat that automation can cut missing invoices by 60%).
- **Compliance & Time-stamping:** The system’s clocks and logs should be synchronized and tamper-proof to support compliance audits (e.g., if needed for SOX). All approvals should be time-stamped accurately, and any changes to records should be traceable.

### Integration Considerations

- **ERP/Accounting Software:** The AP Automation feature must integrate with the company’s General Ledger or ERP system (e.g., QuickBooks, Oracle NetSuite, SAP). Integration points include: pushing approved invoices (as bills or journal entries) to the accounting system to record liabilities, and optionally pulling vendor master data or purchase order data from the ERP. Real-time API integration is preferred for up-to-date data sync, but batch mode (e.g., daily file exchange) should be available for legacy systems.
- **Bank/Payment Systems:** Approved invoices ready for payment need to interface with payment execution. For example, the system might generate a payment batch file (ACH or check run) or call a payment API to actually disburse funds (this ties into the _Multiple Payment Methods_ feature). Integration with banking APIs (e.g., ACH transfers through a bank’s gateway) or with a payments hub will be considered. The AP system should pass necessary data (vendor bank details, amounts, etc.) securely to the payment module.
- **Email & Notifications:** Integration with an email service (SMTP or an email API like SendGrid) is needed to send out notifications (to approvers or vendors). Similarly, integration with an SMS service or mobile app push might be considered for urgent approval alerts (though not mandatory in MVP).
- **Document Management System:** If the organization has an existing document management or cloud storage (SharePoint, etc.), the invoice image and data could be archived there as well. At minimum, the AP module will store documents internally, but providing an export or link to external DMS might be valuable for some clients.
- **Vendor Portal:** In future phases, a vendor self-service portal might be integrated, where vendors can submit invoices directly and check payment status. The AP system should be designed with APIs or data structures that could accommodate ingesting invoices from such a portal and updating status back to it.

### UI/UX Notes

- **Invoice Inbox & Dashboard:** Design a clear “Inbox” view for AP clerks that lists incoming invoices and their status (e.g., _Pending OCR_, _Awaiting Approval_, _Exception – Needs Info_, _Scheduled for Payment_). This should be filterable by vendor, date, amount, status, etc. Key info (vendor name, invoice #, amount, due date, status) should be visible at a glance. Overdue invoices (past due date not yet approved/paid) might be highlighted.
- **Invoice Detail View:** When an invoice is opened, show the extracted data in a form alongside the invoice image or PDF. The UI should allow easy verification and editing: e.g., clicking a field highlights the corresponding area on the image. Line items should be presented in a table with quantity, description, unit price, total, with any unmatched items flagged. If matched to a PO, perhaps show PO info side-by-side or provide a link to view PO details.
- **Approval UI:** Approvers should have a simplified view accessible via web or mobile. The approval screen should show key invoice details (summary, vendor, amount, any notes) and the image, plus options to Approve, Reject (with required comment), or Request More Info. A one-click approve from email (with secure link) can be considered for convenience. The UI should also indicate if the invoice has other approvers (e.g., “You are 1 of 2 approvers – after you approve, it goes to CFO”).
- **Exception Handling:** If an invoice is flagged (duplicate, mismatch, etc.), the UI should clearly show the issue (e.g., a warning banner “Potential duplicate of Invoice #123 from same vendor” that links to the earlier record). For PO mismatches, perhaps highlight the specific line in red and allow entering an explanation or adjusting the quantity if authorized.
- **Responsiveness & Accessibility:** The AP interface should be web-based and responsive (usable on standard browsers and tablets). Approvers often need mobile access, so ensure the critical approval actions are mobile-friendly. Use clear typography and icons (e.g., an icon indicating an invoice is urgent or nearing due date). Also, include accessible design (labels, alt text for any icons, keyboard navigation) to accommodate all users.
- **Visual Indicators:** Provide visual cues such as progress bars or status tags. For example, an invoice card might have a tag like “Pending Manager Approval” or “Approved – Payment Scheduled on 10/30”. This gives users immediate context. Also, show aging info (e.g., “Received 5 days ago”) to prompt quick action on older items.

### Security and Compliance Needs

- **Segregation of Duties:** The AP automation must enforce segregation of duties as a control. The person who enters or edits an invoice (AP clerk) should not be the same person who approves the payment. System role settings (from _Dual Control & User Role Management_) should ensure appropriate separation – e.g., a user with the AP Clerk role cannot approve invoices above a small threshold, and an approver cannot edit invoice data once submitted.
- **Audit & Compliance:** To support compliance audits (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley for public companies), the system should maintain immutable logs of approvals and changes. Any override of controls (for example, if an emergency payment is made without normal approval due to special circumstances) must be logged and reported. The system should be able to generate an audit report of all invoices in a period with their approval history.
- **Data Privacy:** Vendor invoice data may contain sensitive information (bank account numbers, addresses, etc.). The system must protect this data under privacy regulations (GDPR, etc. if applicable, especially if vendor includes individual contractors). Access to invoice images and data should be restricted to authorized users. If invoices are downloaded or exported, that action should be logged.
- **Document Retention:** Financial regulations often require retaining invoices and related documents for a certain period (e.g., 7 years in many jurisdictions). The system should not delete invoice records or images before the retention period. Ideally, provide configurable retention settings and ensure backups of these documents are kept secure.
- **Fraud Prevention:** Duplicate detection (covered above) is a key anti-fraud measure. Additionally, consider implementing a simple vendor verification on large invoices (e.g., requiring confirmation if a vendor’s bank account details have changed from the last invoice) to prevent social engineering fraud. The system could integrate with external databases to validate business identities for new vendors if needed.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** If the company operates in jurisdictions with e-invoicing mandates (like certain countries require electronic invoice submission to government portals), the system should have the flexibility to adapt or integrate to meet those legal requirements. This can be a future consideration.

### KPIs and Success Metrics

Key performance indicators for AP Automation will demonstrate its impact on efficiency and accuracy. Initial targets can be set to measure improvement over baseline manual processes:

- **Invoice Processing Time (Cycle Time):** Measure the average time from invoice receipt to final approval/payment scheduling. Goal: Reduce this to **<2 days on average**, down from a current baseline (e.g., 10+ days manually). Faster cycle time means improved efficiency and ability to capture early-payment discounts.
- **Cost per Invoice:** Track the estimated processing cost per invoice. This can be derived from time spent by staff on AP tasks. Goal: Achieve a cost per invoice that is **50-80% lower** than manual processing (e.g., drop from \~\$15 per invoice to <\$5). This reflects labor savings and productivity gains.
- **Invoices Processed Straight-Through:** Percentage of invoices that go from receipt to approval without any manual intervention (no data correction or exception needed). Goal: e.g., **60%+ straight-through processing** for standard invoices. This indicates the effectiveness of OCR and auto-matching.
- **Duplicate Payment Incidents:** Count of duplicate invoices paid erroneously. Goal: **0 duplicate payments**. The system’s duplicate detection should eliminate this risk. (Benchmark: Manual processes can result in 1-2% duplicate payments, which we aim to eradicate.)
- **Approval Policy Compliance Rate:** Percentage of invoices that follow the defined approval workflow without needing out-of-policy exceptions. Goal: **\~100% compliance**, meaning the system successfully enforced the rules (any deviations should be tracked and explained).
- **Supplier Satisfaction:** Though harder to quantify directly in the system, proxy metrics like **on-time payment rate** can be used. Goal: Pay all invoices by their due dates (100% on-time payment), reducing supplier complaints. A survey could also be used periodically to gauge vendor satisfaction with the AP process improvements.
- **Early Payment Discounts Captured:** If applicable, track the amount saved by capturing early pay discounts (e.g., 2/10 net 30 terms). Goal: Increase this amount versus baseline, demonstrating ROI of faster processing.

## 2. Accounts Receivable Automation

### Feature Overview and Objective

**Overview:** The Accounts Receivable (AR) Automation feature manages the process of issuing invoices to customers and collecting payments, with minimal manual intervention. It automates billing generation, invoice delivery, and tracking of customer payments. By doing so, it accelerates the order-to-cash cycle – businesses can send out invoices faster, provide customers with easy payment options, and promptly reconcile incoming payments. The objective is to improve cash flow (ensuring the company gets paid faster) and reduce the workload on the AR and finance teams in chasing payments or doing manual reconciliations.

**Objective:** This feature seeks to **reduce Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)** and increase collection efficiency. All customer invoices will be digitized and centrally tracked. The system will automatically send invoices (via email or customer portal) as soon as they are generated, and monitor their payment status. When payments are received, either through integrated online payment methods or via offline means (check/wire), the platform will match those payments to the corresponding invoices and update balances. The goal is to significantly cut down the time between providing goods/services and receiving payment. For instance, if the current DSO is high (e.g., 45 days), automating reminders and offering convenient e-payment could reduce DSO by a meaningful margin (industry studies suggest automation can cut DSO by up to \~19 days). Ultimately, AR Automation ensures healthier cash flow, fewer overdue invoices, and less manual effort in collections.

### Detailed User Stories and Use Cases

- **User Story (Billing Specialist):** As a Billing Specialist (AR Clerk), I want to **generate customer invoices quickly and accurately** (with correct customer info, line items, taxes, due dates) so that bills go out immediately after a sale or service delivery, without errors.
- **User Story (Billing Specialist):** As a Billing Specialist, I want the system to automatically **deliver invoices to customers** (via email with PDF or via a customer portal link) as soon as I finalize an invoice, so that there is no delay or manual emailing required.
- **User Story (Customer):** As a Customer who receives an invoice, I want to have a **simple way to pay online** (for example, clicking a secure link to pay by credit card or ACH) so that I can settle my bill quickly rather than dealing with mailing checks or complicated processes.
- **User Story (AR Manager):** As an AR Manager, I want to see a **dashboard of all outstanding invoices** with key info (amount, days outstanding, days to due date, customer name) so that I can easily identify which accounts are overdue or high-risk and take action.
- **User Story (AR Manager):** As an AR Manager, I want the system to **automatically match incoming payments to invoices** (e.g., by payment reference or amount) so that cash application is quick and we always know which invoices have been paid versus still open.
- **User Story (AR Manager):** As an AR Manager, I want to be alerted when an invoice becomes significantly overdue (past its due date by a threshold), and have tools to resend the invoice or escalate to collections, so that we can promptly address late payments.
- **User Story (CFO):** As a CFO, I want to track **accounts receivable metrics** like total receivables, DSO, aging buckets, and collection effectiveness, so that I have visibility into our cash flow and can identify if our collection process is improving or needs attention.
- **User Story (Accountant):** As an Accountant, I want to ensure that every payment received is properly recorded against the correct invoice and customer, and any discrepancies (overpayments, underpayments) are logged, so that the books remain accurate and up-to-date without time-consuming reconciliations.

### Functional Requirements

- **Invoice Generation:** The system shall allow creation of customer invoices, either manually (through a form where a user enters invoice details) or automatically via integration (e.g., an order management or time-tracking system feeding invoice data). Each invoice will include a unique invoice number, invoice date, line items (description, quantity, unit price), taxes as applicable, the total amount, due date, and customer information (billing address, contact email). The system should support setting standard payment terms (e.g., Net 30) and allow overrides per invoice or customer.
- **Recurring Invoices:** If the business model includes recurring fees (e.g., subscriptions or monthly services), the system shall support scheduling recurring invoices. Users can set up an invoice template to recur at specified intervals (monthly, quarterly, etc.), and the system will auto-generate those invoices on schedule.
- **Invoice Delivery:** The system shall send out invoices to customers automatically through configured channels: primarily via email (with a PDF attachment or an embedded link to an online invoice view). It should pull the appropriate contact email from the customer record. The email template should be customizable (with company branding and a polite message). Optionally, for customers who require it, support for snail-mail printing or EDI delivery could be noted for future but is not in the initial scope.
- **Customer Portal Access:** The platform should provide a secure online portal or link where a customer can view their invoice details and payment status. This ties into offering multiple payment options (see _Multiple Payment Methods_ feature). Customers should be able to download a PDF of the invoice, and if they misplace the email, the AR user can resend or share the link easily.
- **Online Payment Integration:** For convenience, each invoice (or the portal) should integrate with payment gateways to allow the customer to pay electronically (credit card, ACH transfer, etc.). This includes generating a payment link or a “Pay Now” button on the invoice. If the customer pays through this link, the system should automatically record the payment against the invoice and mark it as paid. Payment confirmation should update in real-time or near-real-time.
- **Cash Application (Payment Matching):** The system shall automatically match incoming payments to open invoices whenever possible. For example, if an ACH or wire transfer comes in (through bank integration) with a reference number that matches an invoice number, or an exact amount that matches an outstanding invoice, the system should auto-clear that invoice. For check payments, the AR clerk can input the check details (or import a remittance file) to apply payments. The system should allow applying one payment to multiple invoices or multiple payments to one invoice (in case of over/underpayments) and track any open balances.
- **AR Ledger and Accounting Sync:** Each invoice and payment update should feed into the accounting backend. The system should maintain an AR ledger of open vs. paid invoices. If integrated with an external accounting system, it should create corresponding entries (invoice = debit AR, credit revenue; payment = debit cash, credit AR) or mark invoices as paid in that system to avoid double entry. The integration considerations section covers specifics, but functionally the data consistency must be ensured.
- **Aging & Credit Management:** The system shall automatically categorize invoices into aging buckets (current, 1-30 days past due, 31-60, etc.). It should also store a customer’s payment history and optionally credit limit. If a customer has invoices beyond a certain overdue threshold or amount, the system could flag the account (e.g., for review before new sales are made, though actual credit hold processes might be outside this system’s direct scope but reports can highlight it).
- **Dunning & Reminders:** (In coordination with the _Automated Payment Reminders_ feature) The system will be able to trigger reminder emails to customers as invoices approach due or become overdue. Basic functionality: send a reminder X days before due date, on due date, and Y days after if not paid. The content should reference the invoice number and amount due. (Detailed configuration of schedules is covered in feature 17.)
- **Adjustments and Credit Notes:** The system shall support issuing credit memos or adjustments if needed (e.g., if a customer is overcharged or returns goods). A credit note can be applied to an existing invoice (reducing its amount due) or kept on the customer’s account as a credit to offset future invoices. All such adjustments should be tracked and visible.
- **Invoice Status Tracking:** Each invoice record shall have a status (Draft, Sent, Viewed \[if we can track opens], Paid, Partially Paid, Overdue, etc.). Users should be able to see the timeline of the invoice: e.g., “Sent on Jan 5, Viewed by customer on Jan 6, Payment of \$X received on Jan 20.” This provides transparency and helps AR team follow up appropriately.
- **Reporting:** Provide AR-specific reports, such as an Accounts Receivable Aging report (listing all customers with totals in each aging bucket), a DSO calculation, and a collections effectiveness report (% invoices paid on time vs late). These can tie into the broader analytics dashboard but should be available to AR managers within this module as well.

### Technical Requirements

- **Scalability:** The AR system should be able to handle high volumes of invoices and payments, e.g., generating and emailing **thousands of invoices within an hour** for end-of-month billing runs. Email delivery should be done in a way that doesn’t overwhelm servers (e.g., using a queue or a bulk email service API). The system should ensure reliability in sending (with retry logic for email fails).
- **Invoice Template Engine:** There should be a robust templating mechanism for invoice PDFs and emails. Technical requirement is to support customization (company logo, fields) via a template file or configuration. Templates might be in a format like HTML/CSS for PDFs or a templating language. It should support multiple languages or currency formats if needed for international customers.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** The system must securely integrate with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, bank ACH gateway). This includes using secure tokens for transactions so that the platform does not store sensitive card details (PCI compliance). The integration should handle success/failure callbacks. For example, when a payment is completed, the gateway will notify the system (via webhook) to mark the invoice paid. The technical design should ensure idempotency (not double-marking if the webhook is received multiple times) and security (verify that notifications truly come from the gateway).
- **Bank Integration for Cash Application:** For matching external payments (like checks or bank transfers), the system might integrate with bank statements or lockbox files. A technical requirement is to import bank transaction data, either via file upload (common formats like BAI2, CSV) or via bank APIs. The system should parse those and attempt to match to invoices. This process must be able to run daily (or on-demand) and handle large statement files.
- **Data Integrity & Sync:** If the AR data is shared with an ERP/accounting system, the synchronization must be accurate. Ideally use transactions or checksums to ensure an invoice recorded in the platform is recorded once in the ERP. If using APIs, implement retry and reconciliation (e.g., a nightly job to verify all invoices of the day made it to the ERP). Data fields (like customer ID, invoice ID) should be mapped appropriately between systems.
- **Performance:** Viewing and searching invoices in the UI should be optimized (e.g., an AR manager might search by customer or invoice number). Indexing the relevant fields in the database is required to allow quick lookup even if there are hundreds of thousands of invoices in the system.
- **Security & Compliance:** Ensure invoice data cannot be tampered with once issued – perhaps use a system of record locking or versioning for changes. If changes to an invoice are needed (e.g., error in billing), a corrected invoice should be issued rather than silently editing. Also, since customer contact information and possibly payment info are involved, follow GDPR (for EU customer data) and PCI DSS (for any credit card interactions) guidelines strictly. All customer payment methods if saved (like for auto-pay) must be tokenized and not stored in plain form on our servers.
- **Audit Logs:** Every invoice lifecycle event (creation, sending, payment recorded, write-off, etc.) should be logged. This technical log is essential for troubleshooting (e.g., proving an invoice was emailed on a certain date) and for auditors who might want to see that revenue recognition and cash entries have traceability.

### Integration Considerations

- **CRM/Order System Integration:** In many cases, invoice generation might start from another system (e.g., a sales order system, subscription management platform, or CRM). The AR Automation feature should offer APIs or connectors to accept invoice data from these systems. For example, a CRM could trigger an API call to create an invoice in the platform when a deal is closed. Conversely, the platform could send back invoice status (like paid/unpaid) to the CRM for account managers’ visibility.
- **Accounting System Integration:** Like AP, AR must integrate with accounting software for financial reporting. If using an external accounting system, the integration can post invoices and payments to the general ledger or mark them paid. For instance, when an invoice is created in the platform, it should optionally create an invoice (or journal entry) in the ERP for accounting records. When a payment is applied, it should update the ERP’s AR balance. Real-time integration via API is ideal, but batch export (e.g., end-of-day invoice summary) could be available for simpler systems.
- **Payment Gateways and Bank:** Integration with third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe for card payments, ACH networks for bank debits, PayPal for online payments) is a key part of this feature. The platform will need credentials and configuration for each supported gateway. Also, integration with banks for retrieving incoming payment data (like a daily statement or lockbox feed) is crucial for the cash application part. Ensuring these external connections are secure and reliable is critical.
- **Tax Calculation Services:** If invoices need to calculate sales tax or VAT, integration with tax rate services (like Avalara) might be considered. This could ensure the correct tax is applied based on customer location and product. If not built-in, providing a hook for tax calculation (i.e., an API call with invoice data to get tax amounts) is useful for companies operating in multiple jurisdictions.
- **Document Management/Archival:** Invoices (PDFs) might need to be stored or archived externally (for example, saving a copy to an AWS S3 bucket or document management system for long-term retention). Integration to archive invoices after certain time (or in real-time upon issuance) could be considered, to ensure a backup and easy retrieval outside the core system if needed.

### UI/UX Notes

- **Invoice Creation UI:** Provide a user-friendly form for creating/editing an invoice. It should have auto-complete or selection for existing customers (to pull in their details), a table for adding line items (with calculations of totals in real-time), and fields for terms, due date (which could default based on terms). The UI should guard against mistakes (e.g., warn if no items or amount is zero, etc.). Also allow saving a draft invoice if needed before sending.
- **Invoices List & Filters:** The AR main screen might list invoices in a grid or list format with columns like Invoice #, Customer, Issue Date, Due Date, Amount, Status. Filters should allow users to quickly see “Open Invoices”, “Overdue Invoices”, or filter by customer. Sorting by due date or amount should be possible to identify priority items.
- **Customer Account View:** It would be helpful to have a view for each customer showing their details along with all invoices and payments related to them. This gives context (e.g., how many open invoices does this customer have, total outstanding, last payment date). If a customer calls in, the AR clerk can quickly pull this up to answer questions.
- **Payment Recording UI:** For cases where payments are not automatically matched (e.g., a check arrives), the UI should let the user search or select a customer, then mark one or multiple invoices as paid, entering the payment details (date, amount, method, reference #). Ideally, if the payment doesn’t exactly match invoice totals, the UI can help allocate partial payments or split over several invoices and handle remaining balances.
- **Visual Indicators:** The UI should clearly mark overdue invoices (e.g., with a red highlight or an “Overdue” badge and how many days overdue). Invoices approaching due date could have a yellow warning icon. Paid invoices can be shown with a green “Paid” status to quickly differentiate. Graphical charts might be provided on a dashboard (like a bar chart of aging or line chart of DSO over time) for at-a-glance insight.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** While AR tasks are often done on desktop, key elements like the invoice list or basic invoice details should be accessible on a tablet or phone (for a manager checking on receivables on the go). The customer-facing parts (portal/payment) certainly need to be mobile-friendly, as customers may want to view and pay invoices from their phones.

### Security and Compliance Needs

- **Access Control:** Only authorized finance team members should create or modify invoices. The system should have role-based permissions (e.g., AR Clerk can create invoices and apply payments, AR Manager can approve credit notes or write-offs, etc.). Sales team or others might have read-only access to see invoice status but not edit. These roles tie into the central user management feature.
- **Data Accuracy and Integrity:** Once an invoice is issued to a customer, it should not be editable in a way that violates accounting rules. If corrections are needed, a credit note or adjusted invoice should be created, preserving the audit trail. The platform should ensure an issued invoice isn’t accidentally deleted or altered without proper controls (perhaps lock it from editing after sending, or require a manager approval to modify).
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure compliance with accounting standards for revenue recognition – e.g., every invoice should have a date and unique number for audit. If the company is subject to certain regulations (like if in Europe, VAT invoices have specific requirements or SAF-T reporting), the system must be able to capture necessary info (tax IDs, etc.). In the U.S., standard practices like providing IRS-required info for certain charges should be adhered to. If invoices are used for financing or factoring, accuracy is even more critical.
- **Privacy:** Customer data (names, addresses, possibly contact persons’ emails) must be protected under privacy laws. Use secure storage and do not expose customer lists to unauthorized users. Also, if the platform emails invoices, ensure that the emails do not expose other customers’ data (e.g., no CCing multiple customers in one email) and are sent individually.
- **Payment Security:** For online payments, the platform should not directly handle sensitive card data to remain out of PCI scope as much as possible. Use tokenization provided by payment gateways. If ACH bank details are stored for auto-debit, encrypt that information and restrict access. Compliance with NACHA rules for ACH (like storing authorization proof for auto-debits) should be observed in the design of auto-pay functionality (see feature 17).
- **Backup and Retention:** AR records (invoices, payment records) should be backed up and retained for financial record-keeping (often 7+ years). There should be a data retention policy to ensure records aren’t purged too soon and backups to prevent data loss, which could have legal and financial implications.

### KPIs and Success Metrics

We'll measure the impact of AR Automation will focus on how quickly and reliably the company can collect cash, and the efficiency gains in the process:

- **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):** Track the average number of days to collect payment after an invoice is issued. Goal: **Reduce DSO by 20-30%** from the baseline (for example, from 45 days down to \~30 days or less), indicating faster collections.
- **On-Time Payment Rate:** Percentage of invoices paid by the due date. Goal: Increase this metric (e.g., from maybe 60% to **85%+** on-time payments). A higher on-time rate implies the reminders and easy payment options are effective.
- **Collection Efficiency:** Measure the amount of receivables collected with minimal interventions. For example, **Automation Collection Rate** – the percent of invoices that are paid without any manual follow-up. Goal: perhaps **70%+** of invoices get paid without an AR rep having to make a phone call or manual email (the system’s automatic emails suffice).
- **Auto-Matching Rate:** Percentage of payments that the system auto-applies without human effort. Goal: **90%+** of incoming payments are matched to invoices automatically (for companies using electronic payments where references can be tracked). This reduces manual reconciliation work to near zero for most transactions.
- **Invoice Processing Speed:** Time from service completion (or order fulfillment) to invoice sent out. Goal: **<24 hours**. This metric ensures billing is prompt. If currently billing happens weekly or is slow, automation should make it essentially instantaneous once data is available.
- **AR Staff Productivity:** Track the number of invoices managed per AR staff per month. Goal: a significant increase (e.g., one AR staff can handle double the invoices after automation). This can be indirectly measured by volume per person or through time tracking data showing reduced hours spent on manual tasks.
- **Customer Adoption of E-Payments:** Monitor what percentage of payments come through electronic methods (portal, credit card, ACH) versus traditional (checks). Goal: Increase e-payment adoption to **>80%** (if currently, for example, 50% still pay by check). This would indicate the platform is successfully shifting customers to faster, more automated payment modes, which correlates with better efficiency.
