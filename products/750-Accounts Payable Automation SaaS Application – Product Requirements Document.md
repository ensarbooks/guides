# Accounts Payable Automation SaaS Application – Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the **Accounts Payable (AP) Automation SaaS Application** – a cloud-based solution designed to streamline and automate the end-to-end accounts payable process. This document is intended for product managers, designers, engineers, and stakeholders to provide a comprehensive blueprint of the product’s functional and non-functional requirements. It outlines the application’s goals, features, user stories, acceptance criteria, and integration points, as well as performance, security, and compliance expectations.

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

**Purpose:** The purpose of this document is to detail the requirements for an AP Automation SaaS product that **eliminates manual AP tasks**, improves efficiency, ensures compliance, and integrates seamlessly with existing financial systems. It will serve as a guiding framework for the design, development, and deployment of the application.

**Scope:** This PRD covers:

- Core AP automation capabilities, including **customizable workflows, document capture, high-volume processing, centralized document repository, PO matching, approval workflows, compliance features, and system integrations**.
- Detailed functional requirements for **invoice management, supplier (vendor) management, payment tracking**, and **approval processes**.
- Non-functional requirements (security, scalability, usability, auditability, performance, etc.) and compliance considerations (e.g., GAAP, SOX).
- Functional diagrams illustrating key workflows and **integration flows** with external systems (accounting software, ERP, Corporate Performance Management platforms).
- Use cases, **user stories**, and **acceptance criteria** for key features to align development with user and business needs.
- Tables summarizing features, integration points, and workflow states.
- A **glossary** of terms and acronyms related to AP automation.

**Out of Scope:** The actual processing of payments (e.g., executing bank transfers or cutting checks) is _out of scope_ for this product. The application will track payment status, but it will not directly initiate or process payments in banking networks.

### 1.2 Product Vision and Goals

**Vision:** Enable organizations to transform their AP departments from manual, paper-based operations to **highly efficient, automated workflows**. The AP Automation SaaS will reduce invoice processing time, minimize errors, strengthen internal controls, and provide real-time visibility into payables, thus **empowering AP teams to focus on strategic activities rather than repetitive tasks**. The product aims to be the single source of truth for all payables, from invoice receipt to approval to payment status.

**Primary Goals:**

- **Efficiency:** Automate repetitive tasks like data entry and invoice matching to significantly cut processing time and labor costs. For example, use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to capture invoice data, eliminating manual data entry.
- **Accuracy:** Reduce human errors by automating validation (e.g., 3-way matching of invoices to POs and goods receipts) and applying business rules to catch discrepancies early. Fewer errors ensure **compliance with accounting standards and prevent financial leakage** (duplicate or over-payments).
- **Compliance & Control:** Enforce accounting policies, approval limits, and segregation of duties (SoD) through configurable workflows that adhere to **GAAP and Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) internal control requirements**. Maintain an audit trail for all actions for auditability.
- **Visibility:** Provide a **centralized repository** for all supplier invoices and related documents, with powerful search and retrieval. Offer dashboards and reports on AP aging, pending approvals, and processed payments for better cash management.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly connect with **ERP, accounting software, and Corporate Performance Management (CPM) systems** to ensure data flows (invoice data, vendor info, purchase orders, payment status) without manual import/export. The system should complement existing financial systems, not duplicate them.
- **Scalability:** Handle **high volumes of documents** (tens of thousands of invoices monthly or more) and users without performance degradation, supporting growth and periods of peak load (e.g., end of quarter processing).
- **User Satisfaction:** Improve the day-to-day experience of AP clerks, managers, and approvers by providing an intuitive, user-friendly interface with clear task queues, notifications, and self-service vendor portals.

## 2. User Personas and Use Cases

Understanding the end users of the AP Automation application is crucial. Below are key **personas**, their responsibilities, and their primary needs related to AP processing. User stories in later sections will reference these personas.

### 2.1 Persona: Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)

**Description:** The AP Clerk is responsible for day-to-day processing of supplier invoices. This includes capturing invoices (from mail, email, or scans), entering or verifying data, matching invoices to purchase orders, and initiating payment approval workflows.

- **Goals/Needs:**

  - Quickly input or import invoices into the system (via upload, email, or OCR capture).
  - Reduce manual data entry through automation (template recognition, OCR).
  - Easily match invoices to POs and flag any discrepancies.
  - Route invoices to the right approvers without chasing people manually.
  - Have a clear view of which invoices are pending, approved, or on hold.
  - Search and retrieve past invoices and related documents when needed for queries or audits.

- **Pain Points (current/manual process):** Data entry is tedious and error-prone, paper invoices can be lost, matching POs to invoices manually is time-consuming, chasing approvals via email leads to delays, and tracking payment status often involves going into multiple systems or spreadsheets. The AP clerk often has to re-key information into the accounting system.

### 2.2 Persona: Accounts Payable Manager (AP Manager)

**Description:** The AP Manager oversees the AP team and ensures invoices are processed in a timely manner and in compliance with policies. They monitor KPIs like invoice cycle time, pending approvals, and exceptions. They also set up workflows and approval hierarchies.

- **Goals/Needs:**

  - Define **customizable workflows** for different invoice types or departments (e.g., invoices under \$1,000 auto-approve, over \$50,000 require CFO approval).
  - Ensure **segregation of duties** – the person who enters an invoice is not the sole approver for its payment.
  - Gain **visibility into the AP pipeline** (how many invoices are awaiting approval, are overdue, etc.).
  - Configure dashboards and reports to monitor AP efficiency (approval times, exception rates).
  - Manage **vendor relationships** by ensuring prompt payments and quickly resolving issues or discrepancies.
  - Oversee **compliance** with internal controls (all approvals documented) and external regulations (audit trails for SOX).

- **Pain Points:** Lack of real-time status tracking; approvals stuck in someone’s inbox cause late payments and strained vendor relations; difficulty enforcing policy (e.g., sometimes invoices get paid without proper approval in manual processes); preparing for audits is cumbersome due to scattered records.

### 2.3 Persona: Chief Financial Officer (CFO) / Controller

**Description:** Senior financial executives who rely on AP data for cash flow management and financial reporting. They are not daily users but need assurance that the AP process is well-controlled, efficient, and provides data for strategic decisions.

- **Goals/Needs:**

  - Ensure that **financial controls** are enforced (for compliance with SOX and GAAP) – e.g., no payment goes out without proper approval and 3-way match for relevant purchases.
  - Get summary reports on outstanding payables, cash requirements for upcoming payments, and spend analytics by vendor/category.
  - Visibility into any unusual transactions or exceptions (for fraud prevention and compliance).
  - Confidence that AP operations won't lead to compliance violations or audit issues – wants strong audit trails and easy audit reporting.
  - Integration of AP data into the **General Ledger** in the ERP for accurate financial statements.

- **Pain Points:** Concerned about **fraud risks** in AP (e.g., fraudulent invoices) if controls are weak; worried about **late payment fees** or missed discounts due to process inefficiencies; wants to reduce overhead costs by automating AP and reallocating staff to higher-value work.

### 2.4 Persona: IT Systems Administrator / Integration Specialist

**Description:** The technical stakeholder responsible for connecting the AP Automation SaaS with other enterprise systems (ERP, accounting software, document management, etc.) and maintaining the solution.

- **Goals/Needs:**

  - Ensure the SaaS application can integrate via APIs or connectors with the company’s ERP (e.g., SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics) so that vendor data, purchase orders, and invoice/payment records synchronize seamlessly.
  - Manage user access and single sign-on (SSO) configuration for the AP system.
  - Ensure data security (encryption in transit and at rest, proper access controls).
  - Configure data backup, retention policies, and support disaster recovery plans.
  - Monitor performance and scaling – ensure the system can handle peak loads and grow with increasing volume.

- **Pain Points:** Integration pains if APIs are limited or if data mappings are complex; security concerns over a cloud solution handling financial data; ensuring uptime and quick support from the vendor for any issues.

Other potential personas could include **Procurement Officer** (interested in PO matching and insight into spend vs. PO commitments) and **Vendor/Supplier** (if a supplier portal or communications are in scope). However, the focus of this PRD remains on internal users and the internal-facing application features.

## 3. Core Capabilities and Features

This section details the **core capabilities** of the AP Automation SaaS application, as outlined in the project brief, and expands each into specific features with requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria. Each core capability is critical for streamlining accounts payable processes:

1. **Customizable Workflows for Repetitive Tasks**
2. **Document Capture and Imaging**
3. **High-Volume Document Processing**
4. **Centralized Document Repository**
5. **Purchase Order (PO) Matching for Invoices**

8. **Integration with Accounting/ERP/CPM Systems**

Additionally, we include detailed features for:

- **Invoice Management (importing invoices via various methods)**
- **Supplier Management (vendor master data and banking details)**
- **Payments Tracking (status of payments without actual payment execution)**
- **Detailed Approval Process Configurations (criteria-based)**

For each sub-section, we provide a description of the functionality, relevant user stories, and acceptance criteria. Where applicable, diagrams or tables illustrate the workflows and integration points.

### 3.1 Customizable Workflow Automation

**Feature Description:** The system will provide a **Workflow Engine** that allows AP Managers to design and customize approval and processing workflows for invoices and other AP documents. This includes automating repetitive tasks (like data entry validation, routing to the next approver, sending reminders) and defining conditional logic (for example, different approval chains based on invoice amount or vendor type). By automating routine steps, AP staff time is freed from manual coordination, and the process is standardized and accelerated.

Key capabilities of the workflow engine:

- Visual **Workflow Designer**: A UI to configure steps an invoice goes through, such as _New Invoice -> Coding -> Matching -> Approval -> Scheduled for Payment -> Paid_. This could be a drag-and-drop interface to arrange steps and set rules.
- **Rule Configuration**: Ability to set rules/triggers (e.g., “if invoice amount > \$10k, add CFO approval step”; “if vendor is new, require vendor master check step”).
- **Task Automation**: Automate assignment of tasks to specific roles (e.g., invoices for Office Supplies category auto-route to Office Manager for approval).
- **Notifications and Alerts**: Built-in automated emails or in-app notifications for pending approvals, exceptions, or delays (e.g., alert if an invoice is awaiting approval > 5 days).
- **Workflow Templates**: Pre-defined best-practice templates (like a 3-way match approval flow) that organizations can start with and then customize.
- **Repetitive Task Elimination**: Using **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** or built-in logic to handle rote tasks (like copying data from invoice to ERP fields, or checking if totals match) without human intervention.
- **Audit Trail on Workflows**: Every action in the workflow (e.g., who approved, when, any edits made) is logged and tied to the document for full traceability.

**User Stories:**

- _As an AP Manager, I want to define a custom approval workflow based on invoice amount thresholds so that larger expenses get higher-level approvals (e.g., CFO) while small amounts auto-approve, ensuring compliance without delaying minor purchases._
- _As an AP Clerk, I want the system to automatically route an invoice to the correct department manager based on the department or project code on the invoice, so I don’t have to manually figure out who needs to approve it._
- _As an AP Manager, I want to configure automated reminders for approvers who haven’t approved an invoice within 3 days, so that invoices don’t get stuck and we avoid late payments._
- _As a Compliance Officer, I want to enforce that no invoice can be marked “approved” for payment unless it has gone through a matching process and at least one managerial approval, to adhere to internal control policies._
- _As a CFO, I want emergency override capability in workflows (with tracking) so that in rare urgent cases, I can approve and release a payment out-of-cycle, with that decision being logged for audit._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Workflow Configuration UI:** Given I am an AP Manager, when I open the workflow designer, then I can create a sequence of steps for invoice processing, add conditional rules (based on invoice data fields such as amount, vendor, department), and save this as a workflow template. The UI must be intuitive (e.g., using flowchart or decision tree visuals) and require no coding.
- **Multi-Step Approvals:** When an invoice’s amount exceeds set thresholds, the system must automatically add the designated approval steps. For example, for invoices > \$50,000, after manager approval, the workflow automatically routes to the CFO. This routing should happen immediately after the prior step is completed and be visible in the invoice’s status.
- **Auto-Assignment & Routing:** The system must route tasks to the correct user or role based on rules. E.g., if an invoice is tagged with Department = “IT”, it goes to IT Manager for approval. The list of approvers should be configurable (by role, by specific user, or by dynamic lookup such as “manager of the person who created PO”).
- **Notifications:** The system must send email and in-app notifications:

  - To an approver when an invoice is awaiting their approval.
  - To backup approvers or AP Manager if an invoice is not approved within X days (configurable SLA breach notification).
  - Notifications should contain relevant info (invoice #, amount, due date, link to system).

- **Repetitive Task Automation:** Examples:

  - Data entry tasks like copying vendor info from invoice to vendor master record (if differences detected) can be triggered for automation or suggestions.
  - Recurring invoices (e.g., monthly rent) can be recognized and a workflow rule auto-approves if it matches the expected amount and time.
  - The system should integrate with RPA or scripts to auto-populate accounting codes based on vendor or historical patterns, reducing manual coding work.

- **Audit Trails:** Every workflow decision and action is logged:

  - The system maintains a log showing “Invoice #123: Submitted by X on Jan 10, 2025; Routed to Manager (Y) on Jan 10; Approved by Y on Jan 12; Routed to CFO (Z) on Jan 12; Approved by Z on Jan 13; Marked for payment on Jan 13.” This log must be accessible in the UI for each invoice and in aggregate reports.

- **Error Handling:** If a workflow rule is misconfigured (e.g., no approver found for a condition), the system should flag this during configuration (validation) or at runtime send an alert to the AP Manager to intervene, rather than letting the invoice disappear in limbo. The AP Clerk dashboard should show any invoices that are “stuck” with a reason.
- **Performance:** The workflow engine must handle high volumes (e.g., 10,000+ active invoices in workflow) without slowing down task assignment or notifications. Workflows should trigger actions (like next-step assignment or notifications) within seconds of the prior step completion.

**Functional Diagram – Example Workflow:**

Below is a simplified flow of a **two-step approval workflow** for an invoice over the high-value threshold:

```
Invoice Captured -> [System: Auto-extract data] -> AP Clerk Review ->
    [System: 3-way match check] -> If match OK ->
        Manager Approval -> [System: sends notification to Manager] ->
            Manager Approves -> If amount > $50k -> CFO Approval ->
                CFO Approves -> [System: marks invoice as Approved for Payment] ->
                    Scheduled for Payment -> (Integration: send status to ERP Accounts Payable)
```

_(Note: The above is a text representation of a workflow. In the actual product, a visual diagram with decision points “If match OK” or “If amount > \$50k” would be configured via the Workflow Designer UI.)_

### 3.2 Document Capture and Imaging

**Feature Description:** The application will offer robust **document capture** capabilities to convert paper or emailed invoices into digital, processable data. This includes scanning physical invoices, importing PDF or image invoices, and using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) to extract key invoice fields (invoice number, date, amounts, vendor name, line items, etc.). Document imaging ensures that every invoice – regardless of original format – is digitized and stored in the system, forming the basis for a paperless AP process.

Key aspects:

- **Multi-channel Ingestion:** Support capturing invoices via:

  - Scanning (integration with scanners or MFPs, possibly using scanning software or TWAIN interface).
  - Email ingestion – a dedicated email address where suppliers can send invoices (application will fetch emails and extract attachments).
  - File upload – AP clerks can drag-and-drop PDF or image files into the system.
  - Mobile capture (stretch goal) – mobile app or interface to capture a photo of an invoice for remote entry.

- **OCR & Data Extraction:** The system uses OCR to **convert scanned images or PDFs into searchable text**. Advanced capabilities like:

  - **Zonal OCR templates** for common invoice layouts or using AI/ML to recognize fields without pre-defined templates (learning system).
  - **Line-item extraction**: capturing each billed item, quantity, unit price from the invoice if needed for detailed matching.
  - Confidence scoring for extracted data and flagging fields that need human verification (e.g., low confidence capture).

- **Document Imaging & Enhancement:** Preprocessing images for better OCR (de-skew, remove noise, enhance contrast) to improve accuracy.
- **Manual Verification UI:** A validation interface for AP Clerks to quickly review OCR results side-by-side with the invoice image (fields highlighted) and correct any misreads. The system can learn from corrections over time for similar invoice formats.
- **Batch Processing:** Ability to handle high volumes of scans in batch (e.g., AP Clerk scans 100 invoices in a batch, system processes them, possibly using separator pages or barcodes to distinguish invoices).
- **Document Indexing:** Automatically indexing and tagging invoices with key metadata (vendor, date, amount, invoice number) so they can be searched in the repository.
- **Duplicate Detection:** If the same invoice document is captured twice (exact duplicate or same invoice number from same vendor), the system warns the user to prevent duplicate processing/payment.
- **Integrations for OCR:** Optionally, integrate with third-party OCR/IDP engines (like ABBYY, Tesseract, etc.) for specialized needs or use an in-house OCR component.

**User Stories:**

- _As an AP Clerk, I want to scan a stack of paper invoices and have the system automatically create invoice entries with extracted data, so that I don’t have to manually type in all details from each invoice._
- _As an AP Clerk, I want to forward invoice emails from vendors to a dedicated address and have those invoices automatically appear in the system for processing, to save time on downloading and uploading files._
- _As an AP Manager, I want the data capture to reliably recognize key fields (invoice number, vendor name, amounts) with minimal errors, so that we can trust the automation and only handle exceptions._
- _As an AP Clerk, I want a quick way to fix OCR errors by seeing the invoice image next to the extracted fields, so I can correct any mistakes (like a misread total or date) easily._
- _As an Internal Auditor, I need assurance that the original invoice image is stored and linked to each transaction for reference, proving that our financial records are backed by source documents (for audit and compliance)._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Scan and Upload:** The system shall allow invoice ingestion via multiple methods:

  - _Scanning:_ When an invoice is scanned using a supported device, the image/PDF is transmitted to the AP system (via a scan to email or a connector). The system should then create a new invoice record with the attached image, and proceed to OCR.
  - _Email Import:_ Given an email is sent to `invoices@ourcompany.com` (for example) with one or more invoice attachments, the system shall retrieve that email (either via an integration like IMAP or a built-in email gateway) and create corresponding invoice records. The email body and attachments should be saved (for context) and attachments processed via OCR. It should handle common formats: PDF, JPEG/PNG images, TIFF.
  - _File Upload UI:_ The user can upload files through the application (single or multiple). Upon upload, the system should treat each file as an invoice (or allow multi-invoice PDFs to be split, possibly prompting the user if one PDF has multiple invoices).

- **OCR Data Extraction:** For each captured document, the system must extract at least the following fields with a high degree of accuracy:

  - Vendor Name
  - Invoice Number
  - Invoice Date
  - Purchase Order Number (if present)
  - Line items (description, quantities, price) – if detailed processing is in scope; at minimum the total amount.
  - Tax amounts, shipping, and other key fields (depending on typical invoice structure).
  - Due Date (if present, or calculate from terms).
  - Currency (if multi-currency environment).
  - The system should achieve an OCR accuracy rate of e.g. **95%+ on clear machine-printed invoices** for header fields (number, date, total) under typical conditions. Any fields with low confidence (<80% confidence, for example) should be marked for manual review.

- **Manual Verification & Correction:** Provide a screen to review OCR results:

  - Display the invoice image on one side and a form with extracted fields on the other.
  - Highlight on the image where each field’s value was extracted from (e.g., highlight the invoice number on the image when that field is focused).
  - The AP Clerk can edit any field that is incorrect. Changes are saved to the invoice record.
  - If the invoice is a duplicate (same vendor+invoice number combination already in system), immediately alert the user to verify if it’s truly a separate invoice or a duplicate entry.

- **Speed & Batch Handling:** The system should be capable of processing a batch of at least 50 invoices in parallel within a reasonable time (e.g., processing completed within a few minutes for 50 documents, exact performance metrics in Section 5.4 Performance). OCR processing can be asynchronous – after upload/scan, the user can continue working and get notified when OCR is done. In the UI, invoices under OCR processing should show a status like “Processing” and then update to “Pending Verification” or “Ready for Matching” once done.
- **Document Storage & Format:** The original uploaded files and processed text must be stored:

  - All images/PDFs are stored in a secure repository.
  - The system generates a text-searchable PDF or adds a text layer to the scanned PDF for future search.
  - The system should **retain the original fidelity** of documents for legal/audit reasons (i.e., images are not altered beyond readability improvements).

- **Integration with External OCR (if applicable):** If a third-party OCR service is used (like an API call to an OCR engine), the system must handle connectivity issues gracefully. If the external service fails, queue the document to retry and alert admin after X failures.
- **Compliance (Document Retention):** Ensure that once captured, documents are **immutable** records (cannot be edited, only annotated) to serve as an exact copy of vendor invoices, and are retained for the required period (default 7 years, configurable per company policy or local regulations).
- **Security:** The document images might contain sensitive information (like bank account numbers on invoices, or pricing); the system must secure these in transit (if scanning via network, use secure file transfer or HTTPS upload) and at rest (encrypted storage).
- **Supported Languages/Locales:** If the AP operation is global, OCR should support multiple languages or at least basic Latin character sets. (Stretch: multi-language OCR, e.g., if some invoices are in Spanish, French, etc.)

### 3.3 High-Volume Document Processing

**Feature Description:** The AP Automation SaaS is designed to accommodate **high-volume document processing**, meaning it can handle a large number of invoices and related documents efficiently. This includes both system capacity (software performance, database scalability) and user experience (tools to manage large queues of documents). Many organizations receive thousands of supplier invoices per month; the system should scale accordingly without significant performance degradation.

Key considerations for high-volume:

- **Scalability of Processing:** The backend should support parallel processing of OCR, matching, and other tasks. The system could utilize cloud scaling (e.g., multiple OCR workers) to handle spikes.
- **Bulk Actions:** Ability for users to handle invoices in bulk when appropriate. For example, select multiple invoices and assign them all to a certain approver, or approve a batch of invoices (if policy allows, e.g., approving a batch of utility bills together).
- **Queue Management:** For AP clerks, if there are hundreds of invoices to review, provide sorting, filtering, and pagination so they can prioritize (e.g., sort by due date, or filter to see only invoices needing manual intervention).
- **Performance Monitoring:** Provide metrics or dashboards to the AP Manager/IT about throughput (invoices processed per day) and any backlog build-up. If backlog increases, possibly scale up resources (for SaaS provider – auto-scale).
- **Document Loading & Search:** The repository and search functions must remain snappy even with millions of records. Use indexing, archiving of older records, and other techniques to manage volume.
- **Batch Export/Reporting:** Ability to export data (to CSV/Excel) for hundreds or thousands of records for analysis or upload to another system, if needed.
- **Archive Strategy:** For extremely high volumes over years, consider archival solutions for older documents (e.g., archive invoices older than X years to cheaper storage, while still searchable via the interface when needed).
- **Testing/Benchmark Targets:** Non-functional requirement to handle a certain number of invoices/year (e.g., 500k invoices/year) with user concurrency of, say, 50-100 users, without performance issues.

**User Stories:**

- _As an AP Clerk in a large enterprise, I want the system to handle the 500 invoices we receive in a single day at end-of-month without crashing or slowing down, so I can keep working efficiently even at peak times._
- _As an AP Manager, I want to be able to approve or forward multiple invoices at once (when appropriate), such as approving an entire batch of recurring monthly invoices, to save time on repetitive approvals._
- _As an IT Administrator, I need the system to scale (in the cloud) as our volume grows year over year, so that performance stays consistent and we don't have to switch systems when our invoice count doubles._
- _As a Compliance Officer, I want older paid invoices to be archived securely but still retrievable on demand, so that the active system stays efficient but we meet our record-keeping obligations._
- _As a CFO, I don't want to wait long for a report on all outstanding payables even if that list is very large; the system should be able to generate summary data quickly regardless of volume._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **System Throughput:** The system shall be able to ingest and process at least _N_ invoices per hour (where _N_ is a target like 1000 invoices/hour as a benchmark on typical hardware or scale unit). This includes the OCR and data entry workflows. Under expected peak load (for instance, first week of month or end of fiscal quarter where invoice volume might spike), the system should maintain response times for users (UI actions still within acceptable range, e.g., page loads under 3 seconds for lists).
- **Concurrent Users:** Support at least 50 concurrent AP users (clerks, approvers) performing actions without perceptible slowdown. If a large number of approvers all click approve around the same time (like approving many invoices at day-end), the system queues and handles these actions properly.
- **Batch Approval & Actions:** The UI will allow an authorized user (likely AP Manager or higher, with appropriate permission) to select multiple invoice records (e.g., via checkboxes in a list) and perform a bulk action:

  - Bulk approve (if all selected invoices meet criteria for the same approval by that user).
  - Bulk reassign (e.g., reassign 100 invoices from one approver to another if someone is on leave).
  - Bulk export (download selected or all filtered invoices' data to CSV).
  - Bulk archive (if needed).
  - **Acceptance Test:** When 20 invoices are selected and the user clicks "Approve Selected", the system should attempt to approve all 20. Any that cannot be (say one required a higher approval) should be left unchanged with a clear message. The rest should get approved with one confirmation. The activity log should record that these were bulk-approved by the user (with details).

- **Search Performance:** Given a repository of 100,000+ invoices, when a user performs a search or filter (e.g., all invoices from Vendor X this year, or invoice number contains "INV2025"), results should be returned within a few seconds (target < 3 seconds for common queries). Use indexing on key fields to ensure this. The search should be comprehensive (searching both metadata and full text of invoices if needed).
- **Pagination and View:** In any list view (invoices inbox, approval queue, repository list), the system should load in pages (e.g., 50 at a time) and allow navigation, rather than trying to load thousands of records at once in the UI. Provide clear indication of total count and pages.
- **Archiving:** There should be a mechanism to archive older invoices:

  - Define an archival rule (e.g., archive invoices that are fully paid and older than 2 years).
  - Archived invoices are moved to an archive storage but remain accessible via search (perhaps with a slight delay if they need to be retrieved from cold storage).
  - This ensures the primary database remains smaller for performance, while still keeping data for compliance.
  - Acceptance: simulate archive by marking some invoices as archived and see that they no longer clutter primary views, but can be fetched when specifically searched or requested.

- **Resilience and Recovery:** In high volume operations, if any component fails (e.g., an OCR service instance crashes under load), the system should retry tasks or have redundant instances to continue processing. No data should be lost; unprocessed invoices remain in a queue.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** The system (or the SaaS ops team) should monitor if processing times are growing or queues are backing up. If invoices start to queue up (e.g., more than 100 waiting for OCR at once), automatically scale up OCR workers (in cloud environment) or at least send an alert to admin that performance is being impacted.
- **User Feedback for Processing:** For long-running tasks (like processing a batch of 500 invoices), the UI should inform the user that the task is in progress and perhaps provide a progress indicator or notification when complete, so they don't attempt re-uploading or get confused.

_(Note: Specific volume numbers will be refined based on target customer size. The requirements aim for enterprise-grade scalability.)_

### 3.4 Centralized Document Repository

**Feature Description:** The application will include a **centralized repository** that stores all AP documents (invoices, credit memos, debit notes, etc.) in one place, making them easily searchable and retrievable by authorized users. This repository functions as the digital file cabinet for Accounts Payable, eliminating the need to handle physical paper archives. Each document in the repository is indexed with key metadata and linked to transaction records (such as the accounting entry or payment record). The repository supports robust search capabilities and access controls.

Key functionalities:

- **Document Indexing & Metadata:** Automatically capture and store metadata for each document (vendor, invoice number, date, amount, status, etc.). Allow additional tags or notes to be added (e.g., “urgent”, “disputed”).
- **Advanced Search:** Provide search by various criteria:

  - Basic search: by vendor name, invoice number, etc.
  - Advanced filters: date ranges, amount ranges, status (e.g., approved, pending, paid), PO number, project code, etc.
  - Full-text search: search within the content of invoices (enabled by OCR text) – e.g., find all invoices containing a certain item description.

- **Document Viewer:** In-app viewer to open invoice images/PDFs quickly. The user should be able to see the invoice side-by-side with processing history or details.
- **Folder/Organization (Virtual):** Possibly allow grouping invoices by categories (e.g., by month, by vendor) virtually for convenience. But since it’s centralized and searchable, strict folder structures might be less needed.
- **Audit Trail & Versioning:** Keep track of any actions on the document (viewed by who, any annotations made). If any changes to associated data occur (like AP Clerk corrected the amount), record it.
- **Export/Download:** Ability to download copies of documents (PDFs) if needed (with appropriate permissions). Possibly zip multiple invoices for external audit requests.
- **Security and Access Control:** Ensure only authorized roles can view certain documents. For example, maybe invoices related to confidential projects or certain departments should be restricted. Implement role-based access: e.g., AP clerks can see all, department managers see only invoices for their department, etc., as needed.
- **Retention and Deletion:** Support data retention policies. E.g., automatically delete or archive documents after X years post-payment if policy says (some companies might want >7 years retention for financial records). Possibly integrate with compliance to lock documents from deletion if under audit hold.
- **Integrations:** The repository might integrate or export to other document management systems if needed (but primarily it’s self-contained).

**User Stories:**

- _As an AP Clerk, I want to quickly search the system for any invoice by number or by vendor name to answer vendor inquiries or to verify if we received an invoice._
- _As an AP Manager, I want to retrieve all invoices from last quarter for vendor XYZ to prepare for a spend analysis meeting. I’d like to filter by date and vendor and get them all._
- _As an Internal Auditor, I want to pull up the original invoice document and see all actions taken on it (approval dates, who processed it) to verify compliance during an audit._
- _As a Department Manager (approver), I want to be able to view the invoice image attached to an approval request, so I know what I am approving without having to ask AP for a copy._
- _As an IT Administrator, I need all documents to be stored securely and backed up, with an ability to restore if something is accidentally deleted, to ensure we don’t lose financial records._
- _As a Compliance Officer, I want to ensure that documents cannot be tampered with (no deletion or editing of original images) and that they are retained for the legally required period._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Uploading & Indexing:** When an invoice is captured (through any method), it is automatically added to the repository. The system indexes fields (invoice number, vendor, etc.) either from extracted data or entry. Verify that a new invoice shows up in search results by those fields shortly after capture.
- **Search Functionality:**

  - _Exact Field Search:_ Given an invoice with number "INV-1001" exists, when the user searches for "INV-1001", that invoice should appear in results.
  - _Partial Search:_ If user searches "1001", by default the system should match partial on invoice numbers (or provide wildcard search capabilities).
  - _Vendor Search:_ Searching by vendor name "Acme Corp" should return all invoices for that vendor (with perhaps quick totals shown).
  - _Filters:_ The UI should allow adding filters: e.g., Date from/to, Amount > X, Status=Pending, etc., and combine them (e.g., all pending invoices over \$1000 from last month).
  - _Full-Text:_ If full-text search is enabled, and an invoice contains the word "Consulting Services" in its line items, a search for "Consulting Services" should find that invoice. Acceptance test might involve uploading a dummy invoice with unique text and confirming search finds it.
  - The search results should display key info in a table (e.g., Invoice #, Vendor, Date, Amount, Status) and allow sorting by these columns.

- **Document Viewing:** Clicking on a search result or an invoice in a list opens the document view:

  - The scanned invoice image or PDF is displayed clearly (with zoom, rotate if needed).
  - Important fields or extraction highlights are optionally shown.
  - The viewer should load quickly (a few seconds at most for even large images).
  - If multiple pages, allow scrolling or page navigation.
  - Provide download option (PDF download).

- **Linking:** From the document view, users should see or navigate to related records: e.g., the linked purchase order (if matched), the payment transaction or check number (if paid), etc. Also from an accounting perspective, maybe a link to the ERP entry (if integrated).
- **Access Control:** Implement basic controls such that:

  - Only logged-in users with appropriate roles can search or view documents.
  - Perhaps a role "AP Viewer" vs "AP Processor" vs "Approver". Approvers might only see those invoices pending their approval or that they approved, not everything (depending on company’s preference; some might allow all approvers to see all, but at least ensure external users cannot get in).
  - Ensure that if an approver from Dept A tries to search invoices of Dept B (and policy says they shouldn’t), the system respects that (maybe tie invoice access to department roles).
  - All access attempts should be logged (who viewed what).

- **Bulk Export:** For audit or backup, authorized users can select multiple documents or a range (e.g., all in 2024) and export. Possibly a feature for Admin: “Export archive – all 2024 invoices” which packages into a zip or pushes to an external storage.

  - This should be done with caution (only admin role) due to security. But needed for audits or switching systems.

- **Audit Trail:** Each invoice record should have an audit log accessible. Acceptance: For a given invoice, viewing its audit tab shows time-stamped entries like “Jan 12 2025 10:05 AM – Invoice created by OCR (system)”, “Jan 12 2025 10:10 AM – Data verified by John Doe”, “Jan 13 2025 09:00 AM – Approved by Jane Smith”, etc. Ensure this list is complete for key events.
- **Immutability:** Once a document is in the repository, the image/PDF cannot be altered through the app. If a correction is needed, it should be done via metadata or adding a newer version, but the original stays. If a document is mistakenly added, deletion should be an admin-level action with trace (and typically we’d not delete invoices, just mark void or something if needed).
- **Retention Settings:** The system should allow configuration for how long to keep documents (never delete by default). If a deletion policy is set (say 10 years), it should purge or archive documents past that age with confirmation.
- **Storage & Backup:** Although invisible to users, ensure that the underlying storage of documents is redundant and backed up. In a SaaS, this is handled by cloud infrastructure – acceptance criteria is that in case of a server failure, no documents are lost (tested via backup restoration drills, etc., more on non-functional section).
- **Integration**: If an external document management system is used by the company, allow an export or link. E.g., the system could push a copy of all documents to a SharePoint or content management system if required. This might be an integration plugin rather than core, but the architecture should consider it.

### 3.5 Invoice Matching (PO Matching)

**Feature Description:** **Invoice matching** refers to the process of comparing invoice details with related documents such as Purchase Orders (POs) and receiving reports to ensure consistency. The application will support **2-way matching** (invoice vs. purchase order) and **3-way matching** (invoice vs. PO vs. receiving document) for supplier invoices. The goal is to automatically validate that:

- The billed items/prices match what was ordered (per the PO).
- The quantities and items match what was received (per goods receipt or delivery confirmation).
- The invoice has not been paid already.
- Any discrepancies are flagged for review (price differences, quantity short/over, missing PO, etc.).

Key functionalities:

- **PO Retrieval:** Integration with ERP or procurement system to fetch PO details and goods receipt information. Possibly via an API or file import. This ensures the AP system knows what was ordered and received.
- **Auto-Matching Engine:** When an invoice is captured, if a PO number is present (or can be inferred by vendor+maybe invoice referencing a PO):

  - The system pulls the corresponding PO and receipt data.
  - Compares line items: item IDs or descriptions, quantities, unit prices, totals, tax, etc.
  - Supports tolerance levels (e.g., allow small variances like 5% price difference or minor quantity differences, configurable).
  - If all match within tolerance, mark invoice as “Matched” (ready for approval/payment).
  - If mismatches, mark as “Exception” and route to an exception handling workflow (perhaps AP Clerk or buyer to resolve).

- **Exceptions Handling:** Provide an interface for AP Clerks to manage unmatched invoices:

  - Show what the invoice said vs what PO/receiving said (highlight differences).
  - Possibly allow linking to a different PO if the invoice referenced wrong PO.
  - If items were partially received, mark waiting for remaining goods, etc.
  - Integrate communication: maybe send message to the purchasing department or vendor about a discrepancy.

- **Manual Matching:** If an invoice doesn’t have a PO number, allow AP user to search and link it to a PO (in cases where invoice forgot to mention PO).
- **Non-PO invoices:** Not all invoices have POs (e.g., utilities, subscriptions). Those should be handled via other coding (assign to GL accounts directly). The workflow engine can distinguish PO-backed vs non-PO invoices and skip matching for the latter, going straight to coding/approval.
- **Multi-way matching enhancements:** In addition to 3-way, some cases might want 4-way (if including an inspection document or contract). Initially, focus on standard 2 or 3.
- **Matching Rules Config:** Ability to configure match requirements by vendor or category (e.g., for some vendor, always require 3-way; for services maybe just 2-way; or if no PO, require managerial approval by default).
- **Duplicate Invoice Checking:** This is part of matching logic in a sense (ensuring the same invoice isn’t processed twice). We already covered duplicate detection in capture; reinforcing here that matching includes verifying invoice number hasn’t been paid before.
- **Logging & Approvals:** If an invoice matches completely, it might auto-approve at least the matching step, but still may need an approver sign-off depending on policy (some orgs auto-approve matched invoices below a threshold). The system should support straight-through processing for perfect matches within limits.

**User Stories:**

- _As an AP Clerk, I want the system to automatically check an invoice against the purchase order we issued and the receiving report, so that I don’t manually compare line by line and can quickly see if everything is okay._
- _As an AP Manager, I want invoices that fully match our POs and receipts to bypass unnecessary approvals (still recorded, but not needing manual intervention) for efficiency, while any mismatched invoices are caught and flagged for my team’s review, ensuring we only pay what we owe._
- _As a Purchasing Manager, I want to be notified if an invoice arrives for which the goods haven’t been received or the price is higher than agreed, so I can get involved to resolve the issue with the vendor or update the PO._
- _As a CFO, I want assurance that the system will prevent overpayments and fraud by enforcing a 3-way match, which is a key internal control in AP._
- _As an Auditor, I want evidence in the system that for each invoice tied to a PO, the system recorded a match or any exceptions, as proof that the 3-way matching control is operating effectively._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **PO Data Integration:** The system shall retrieve PO and receipt data for matching.

  - If integrated with an ERP: e.g., via API calls given a PO number, get details like item list, quantities ordered, unit prices, and receipts (quantities received, date).
  - If not integrated live, the system can accept nightly data sync or file import of open POs and recent receipt transactions.
  - The retrieval must be secure and only for relevant data. Test: given invoice with PO 450001234, system successfully pulls PO 450001234 details from ERP within a few seconds.

- **Automatic Matching Logic:**

  - For an invoice linked to PO:

    - Compare invoice line count with PO line count (for matching items).
    - For each line, match by an identifier (if available, like item code) or by description and amount.
    - Sum totals and tax. Ensure the invoice total matches PO total (or within tolerance if partial deliveries).
    - If all lines and totals match (within tolerance), the invoice is marked “Matched” = yes.
    - If any discrepancy:

      - e.g., Invoice quantity > received quantity.
      - Unit price on invoice > unit price on PO.
      - Extra line on invoice not in PO.
      - Then mark “Matched” = no, and categorize the exception type (quantity variance, price variance, missing PO, etc.).

    - Tolerance: For example, allow up to 2% price difference to still consider match (to account for minor currency or price adjustments), configurable per company or per vendor.

  - Acceptance: Create a scenario where an invoice is exactly as PO – see it get auto-matched. Another scenario where one field differs – see it flagged.

- **Exception Workflow:**

  - When an invoice is flagged as an exception, it should not progress to final approval until resolved.
  - The system will alert the AP Clerk (or specific “Exception handler” role).
  - In the UI, there’s a section for “Exceptions” where these invoices appear with details of mismatch.
  - Provide options for resolution:

    - Update the PO: Perhaps the PO was changed or needs change – allow a way to refresh data if PO gets updated in ERP after discrepancy discovered.
    - Split/Merge: If invoice covers multiple POs, allow linking multiple POs.
    - Override: Allow AP Manager to override the match requirement (with a reason) and approve for payment – this should be logged and ideally require a note (for audit trail why it’s okay).
    - Dispute: Mark invoice as disputed and notify procurement or vendor; maybe send an email or note through system to the buyer responsible.

  - Acceptance test: Flag an invoice with mismatch, ensure it appears in exception list, simulate a resolution (like user overrides with comment) and then allow it to continue in workflow.

- **Matching Status in Workflow:**

  - The matching process should be a step in the workflow before final approval. For instance, “Match Verification” as a status.
  - If matched, it moves automatically to next step (approval or auto-approved if configured).
  - If not matched, it moves to “Pending Review” state for AP Clerk.
  - Provide visual indicator on the invoice record (e.g., a badge or field showing “3-Way Match: Successful” or “Exception”).

- **Non-PO Invoice Handling:**

  - If an invoice has no PO number, the system should skip matching by default but require AP clerk to code it to an account or category. The workflow might branch: PO Invoices go through matching, Non-PO go directly to coding and approval.
  - Acceptance: An invoice with blank/none in PO field should not attempt matching and should be marked as “Non-PO invoice” requiring manual GL coding.

- **Duplicate Check:**

  - As part of matching/validation, when an invoice is being processed, the system should check if same vendor & invoice number already exists and is paid or in process.
  - If yes, flag as possible duplicate. (This was mentioned in capture as well, but it's so important to avoid double paying that we mention it here too).
  - Acceptance: Try to input a duplicate invoice, see that system prevents progressing.

- **Matching Configurability:**

  - Admin can define for which vendors or categories the 3-way match is required vs only 2-way. E.g., services might only have 2-way (no goods receipt).
  - The system should allow turning off matching for certain invoice types (like utility bills).
  - Acceptance: Mark a vendor or category as “No PO required” and see that invoices from them don’t expect a PO match.

- **Logging:**

  - All matching attempts and results should be logged. E.g., in the invoice audit trail: “System matched to PO 450001234: Result – Price variance on line 3”. If override, log who overrode.
  - For audit, produce a report of unmatched invoices and their resolution.

- **Integration Loop (optional advanced):** If integrated tightly, when an invoice is fully approved for payment, it could update the ERP that invoice is vouchered or ready to pay. Conversely, if a PO invoice is processed, mark the PO in ERP as invoiced. But those details might be handled by exporting data to ERP (next sections). Important is that the source of truth (ERP) and AP system remain in sync about what’s done.

### 3.6 Invoice Management (Importing & Processing Invoices)

**Feature Description:** **Invoice Management** encompasses the end-to-end handling of invoices in the system: from initial entry/import (which overlaps with capture, but also includes handling digital invoice data like EDI or CSV imports), through coding, to tracking their status through the workflow. This section covers how invoices get into the system aside from scanning (like direct data import from vendors or other systems), how they are organized, and any manual entry if needed.

Key functionalities:

- **Multi-Format Import:** Support importing invoice data not just via OCR, but also:

  - **Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)** feed or other structured formats if vendors send EDI 810 (invoice) documents.
  - **CSV/Excel Import** for cases like uploading a batch of invoices exported from another system.
  - **API ingestion:** If vendors or systems want to push invoice data via API (e.g., a vendor portal sending directly).
  - Ensure data from such sources is mapped to the same invoice fields and goes through similar validation.

- **Manual Invoice Entry:** Provide a form for AP Clerks to manually enter an invoice if needed (e.g., if OCR fails or if receiving an invoice by phone or in an emergency). The form should have all relevant fields (with suggestions to pick vendor from master list, etc. to avoid errors).
- **Invoice Index Fields:** Ensure each invoice record has fields for:

  - Invoice ID (unique internal ID).
  - Vendor (link to vendor master).
  - Invoice number (vendor’s number).
  - Invoice date, received date, posting date.
  - Due date (calculated from terms or given).
  - Amount (subtotal, tax, total).
  - Currency.
  - PO number (if any).
  - Description or memo.
  - Status (new, in process, approved, paid, etc.).
  - Approval history, etc.

- **GL Coding (Account Allocation):** If needed, allow splitting an invoice amount into multiple accounts/cost centers (especially for non-PO invoices). For PO-based, the coding might come from PO lines.

  - For example, an invoice for office supplies might be split 50% to Dept A, 50% to Dept B budgets.
  - The system should allow adding multiple coding lines (account, department, amount or percentage).
  - Ideally, suggest GL code based on vendor (e.g., vendor “Staples” always goes to Office Supplies expense account), but allow override.

- **Credit Memos & Adjustments:** The system should handle credit notes from vendors (negative invoices). These should be trackable and applicable to future payments or refunds.
- **Invoice Status Tracking:** Clearly define status states (we will detail in a table of workflow states in section 3.10 or 4.x). E.g., Draft -> Pending Approval -> Approved -> Scheduled -> Paid -> etc. Automatically update status as it flows through the process. Provide visibility of status to users (including possibly a vendor portal if in scope).
- **Payment Scheduling (but not executing):** Once approved, an invoice may be marked for payment on a certain date or cycle. The system can mark an invoice as “Scheduled for payment on \[date]” which indicates it’s in the payment queue. It will then later get marked “Paid” when a payment is completed (via integration update).
- **Handling Errors:** If a payment fails or an invoice is rejected after approval (like vendor dispute), have statuses like “Payment Error” or “On Hold”. Manage re-opening an invoice if needed (with appropriate restrictions).
- **Recurring Invoices:** Option to mark an invoice as recurring template if it comes regularly, to generate the next period’s invoice entry automatically or to match easily (stretch feature).
- **UI Considerations:** The main “Invoices” screen for AP clerks should show a list or inbox of invoices with their key info and status, and allow actions (approve, send for approval, etc.). Filtering that list by status, vendor, etc. helps manage work.

**User Stories:**

- _As an AP Clerk, I want to import a spreadsheet of 50 utility invoices at once (with vendor, date, amount) which we received via an electronic feed, so I don’t have to create each invoice record manually._
- _As an AP Clerk, I need to manually enter an invoice that was phoned in by a vendor (rare case) or a handwritten invoice, so that every invoice can still be tracked in the system even if not digital._
- _As an AP Clerk, after verifying an invoice’s details, I want to assign the correct accounting code (general ledger account) if it’s not tied to a PO, so that the accounting entries will be correct downstream._
- _As an AP Manager, I want to see the status of all invoices at a glance, for example how many are pending approval or have issues, so I can manage the workload and identify bottlenecks._
- _As a Finance Manager, I want to ensure credit memos are properly recorded and linked to original invoices or vendor accounts, to offset payments appropriately._
- _As an IT/Integration Specialist, I want an API that allows our procurement system to send invoice data directly into the AP system when a vendor submits an e-invoice through our procurement portal, ensuring no delay between systems._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Manual Entry Form:**

  - The system provides a form to input a new invoice. All fields listed above (invoice number, date, etc.) must be present and have validation (e.g., date must be a date, amount a number, required fields like vendor and invoice number cannot be blank).
  - Vendor selection should tie to vendor master (typeahead or dropdown of existing vendors; allow adding new vendor if permitted by role).
  - If invoice number + vendor combination is entered that duplicates an existing open or paid invoice, show a warning (duplicate check).
  - After saving, the invoice record is created and visible in the system with status "New" or "Entered" and can proceed to next steps.

- **Bulk Import (CSV):**

  - Provide a template or mapping for CSV import. E.g., a CSV with columns: Vendor Name, Invoice Number, Date, Amount, etc.
  - The system either offers a UI to upload CSV or instructs to place file in a certain location (for automated daily imports, if needed).
  - On import, create invoice records for each line. If any line has errors (e.g., vendor not found), those are reported and not imported, or imported as drafts requiring fix.
  - Acceptance: Using a sample CSV of say 5 invoices, import and confirm 5 invoice records created.

- **EDI/API Import:**

  - If an EDI 810 file is received, parse it (which contains structured invoice data) and create invoice record(s). Might require integration with an EDI translator tool unless built-in.
  - If using API: Document the API for `Create Invoice` with JSON payload including all needed fields. Test by calling the API with a valid invoice payload; the system should respond with success and the invoice appears in the UI.

- **GL Coding:**

  - For a non-PO invoice, the UI should present a section to allocate accounts. By default maybe one line with default account for that vendor.
  - The user can add lines (split by amount or percentage).
  - Must ensure total allocated equals invoice total (validation).
  - If integrated to ERP, these account codes should correspond to actual chart of accounts – possibly the system pulls a list of valid account codes from ERP. Provide dropdown or validation for account code fields.
  - Save this coding and store it.
  - For PO-based invoices, if the PO had account assignments, ideally auto-apply those (each PO line might have an account). If splitting needed due to partial, do proportionally.
  - This coding info will be used later when exporting to accounting.

- **Invoice Status Flow:** (Detailed states will be listed separately, but high-level criteria)

  - New invoices (via scan/import/manual) start as e.g. “New” or “Pending Review”.
  - After data confirmation -> status “Pending Approval” (or “Matched” if requires matching first).
  - Approved -> status “Approved” or “Scheduled”.
  - If exported to payment system -> “In Payment Process”.
  - When paid (via update) -> “Paid”.
  - If any rejection (approver rejects or cancels) -> “Rejected” or “On Hold”.
  - If error (like payment bounced) -> “Error” state.
  - The system must update these automatically as triggers happen. E.g., when last approver signs off, mark Approved. When a payment file is generated, mark as In Process, and once confirmation of payment (like a paid date entered or bank file confirmed) then mark Paid.
  - Acceptance: Simulate an invoice going through each stage and verify status changes correctly in UI and is logged.

- **Credit Memo:**

  - Allow creating credit memos similar to invoices but with negative amounts. Ideally link to original invoice or to vendor.
  - Ensure the system can apply a credit memo: e.g., if vendor invoice \$100 and a credit -\$20, the system should show net \$80 due or allow the credit to be applied against an open invoice before payment.
  - Or export credit memos to accounting to handle.
  - Acceptance: Create a credit memo, system stores it as negative, doesn't require payment, but can mark it as “Applied” when matched with an invoice or when refunded.

- **Payment Scheduling:**

  - Once approved, an AP clerk/manager might set a payment date or it could default to invoice due date.
  - The system could integrate with a payment calendar, showing upcoming due invoices.
  - Marking as “Scheduled” doesn’t move money, but is a status that indicates finance is going to pay it on that date.
  - Possibly generate a payment batch file (but actual processing is outside scope, still we might produce a file for banks).
  - Acceptance: After approval, user sets a pay date for invoice (if not set, default due). System marks scheduled. It remains waiting until that date or until a manual trigger to indicate paid.

- **Error Handling:**

  - If an approver rejects an invoice (with reason), it should go back to AP clerk with status “Rejected” or “Requires Changes”. AP can then edit (if allowed) and re-submit or cancel.
  - If the integration returns a payment error (e.g., bank rejected payment because account invalid), the invoice should mark as “Payment Failed” and alert AP to contact vendor to update info. After updating vendor info, AP can reschedule payment.
  - Acceptance: Mark an invoice with a fake error, see that status and notifications happen.

- **Recurring Invoice Templates:**

  - (Optional) Mark an invoice as recurring (with frequency). System could auto-generate the next invoice entry X days before due. At minimum, store recurring info so AP knows it’s expected again.
  - This is an advanced function and may not be in initial scope, but if included: acceptance would be scheduling and generation logic tested.

#### Table: Workflow Status States for Invoices

To clarify the invoice management lifecycle, below is a **table of key workflow states** an invoice might go through, with description and allowable transitions:

| **Status**                | **Description**                                                                     | **Next Possible States**                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **New** (Captured)        | Invoice just entered or captured, data may need verification.                       | Verified, Pending Approval, Rejected                   |
| **Verified** (Data OK)    | Data confirmed (after OCR/manual entry). Ready for matching or coding.              | Pending Approval, Exception (if matching fails)        |
| **Exception**             | Invoice has issues (e.g., match discrepancy, missing info) and needs resolution.    | Resolved (back to Pending Approval) or Cancelled       |
| **Pending Approval**      | Awaiting one or more approvals per workflow.                                        | Approved, Rejected                                     |
| **Approved**              | All required approvals obtained; invoice is approved for payment.                   | Scheduled for Payment, (or directly Paid if immediate) |
| **Scheduled for Payment** | Payment is scheduled (e.g., assigned to a payment batch or due date).               | Paid, Payment Failed                                   |
| **Paid**                  | Invoice has been paid in full (confirmed by payment process).                       | (End state, or possibly Adjusted if something happens) |
| **Payment Failed**        | A payment attempt failed (e.g., returned, technical issue).                         | Scheduled for Payment (retry), On Hold                 |
| **On Hold**               | Invoice payment is on hold (e.g., dispute or waiting info).                         | Pending Approval (if re-opened), Cancelled             |
| **Rejected**              | An approver rejected the invoice. Requires AP to review.                            | Pending Approval (if re-submitted), Cancelled          |
| **Cancelled**             | Invoice is cancelled/voided – not to be paid (e.g., entered in error or duplicate). | (End state, no further processing)                     |

_Note:_ Not all flows will use every state (e.g., “Verified” might be implicit). But this provides a blueprint for status handling. Transitions should be controlled by user actions or system triggers, with appropriate logging.

### 3.7 Supplier (Vendor) Management

**Feature Description:** The AP Automation system will include a **Supplier Management** module, or at minimum integrate with the existing vendor master data from an ERP. This is crucial because accurate vendor information (names, addresses, **banking details**) is needed for processing invoices and tracking payments. The system should ensure that vendor data is correct and maintained, and that any changes (especially banking details used for payments) are verified for security.

Key functionalities:

- **Vendor Master Data Import & Sync:** The system should either maintain its own vendor database or sync from an external accounting/ERP system. Key fields per vendor:

  - Vendor ID (unique code).
  - Name.
  - Address(es).
  - Contact info (phone, email of vendor’s billing contact).
  - Payment terms (net 30, etc.).
  - **Banking details** (Bank account number, routing number or IBAN/SWIFT for international, bank name) – sensitive info, needs protection.
  - Tax ID or VAT ID of vendor for compliance.
  - Default GL account or expense category (if any).
  - Active/Inactive status.

- **Vendor Creation/Onboarding Workflow:** Ability to add new vendors:

  - Possibly restricted to certain users or integrated from procurement systems.
  - If done in AP system, maybe a request form AP fills, then vendor master data team approves (to ensure due diligence).
  - Check for duplicates (don’t allow same Tax ID twice, etc.).

- **Vendor Portal (optional future):** Possibly allow vendors to log in to see their invoice statuses, but for this PRD, focus on internal management. However, could mention future portal where vendors update their info or upload invoices directly.
- **Bank Details Verification:** When vendor banking details are entered or updated, the system should:

  - Require verification steps (enter it by one user, approve by another, or confirm via a micro-deposit process, etc. if integration with banking verification).
  - Always log changes to bank info and perhaps notify a manager when changed, as these are critical to prevent fraud (fraudsters sometimes try to change vendor bank details to divert payments).

- **Integration for Payments Tracking:** The vendor record will link to all invoices for that vendor and their payment status, giving a quick view of how much is owed, any overdue, etc., which helps vendor relationship management.
- **Compliance Data:** Attach any relevant compliance documents (like W-9 for US vendors, or certificates) to vendor records if needed, and note if vendor is approved, etc.
- **Vendor Merge/Clean-up:** In case duplicate vendor entries exist, have a way to merge or at least cross-reference.
- **Performance:** The vendor list could be large (thousands of suppliers), so search and select of vendors should be efficient.

**User Stories:**

- _As an AP Clerk, when I receive an invoice from a new vendor that’s not in our system, I want to request adding that vendor to our master so I can process the invoice, including capturing their name, address, and importantly their banking info for payment._
- _As an AP Manager, I want to ensure that any time a vendor’s bank account details are changed, we have a control in place (like requiring two people or a phone verification with the vendor) to prevent fraud._
- _As an AP Clerk, I want the system to auto-fill vendor details on an invoice if the vendor is recognized (by name or ID) to reduce data entry and avoid typos._
- _As a Vendor Manager or Procurement, I’d like to see a quick summary per vendor of how many invoices they’ve sent, average payment time, and if there are any open issues, which helps in supplier reviews._
- _As an Internal Auditor, I need to see a log of all vendor master changes, especially bank info, to ensure compliance with anti-fraud measures (SOX requirement for change management)._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Vendor Data Import:** If we assume ERP is master, then:

  - The system shall import all active vendor records from ERP at initial setup.
  - Subsequently, either periodic sync (e.g., nightly) or real-time via API when a vendor is added/changed in ERP.
  - Test by adding a dummy vendor in ERP and see it appear in AP system after sync.

- **Vendor Create/Edit in AP System:**

  - The UI provides a way to create a new vendor (with appropriate permission only).
  - Fields required: name, at least one identifier (like tax ID), default currency maybe, and payment terms.
  - If banking info is entered, mark as pending verification (if our process requires separate verification).
  - On save, if duplicate name or tax ID found, prompt user to confirm it's not duplicate.
  - New vendor either goes into a pending state if approval required (workflow for vendor onboarding) or immediately available.
  - Editing an existing vendor: allow updates to address, contacts, terms, etc., but for banking, trigger special flow.

- **Banking Details Security:**

  - When bank account or routing info fields are edited, require re-authentication of the user or a secondary confirmation (depending on how deep we want; at least log it).
  - Possibly send a notification: e.g., “Vendor ABC’s banking details changed on Feb 1 by UserX” to AP Manager’s email.
  - Keep old info in history (in case revert needed).
  - Optionally, integrate with vendor verification: e.g., send an email to vendor’s known email to confirm the change.
  - Test by changing a bank field and ensure the above actions happen.

- **Vendor Lookup in Invoice Entry:**

  - Wherever a vendor is to be selected (manual invoice entry, or verifying OCR result), the system should provide a search-as-you-type to find the vendor. It should match on vendor name, ID, maybe address.
  - If not found, allow “Add new vendor” (if user has rights) or “request new vendor”.
  - The OCR module ideally should match the vendor name on the invoice to a known vendor record (fuzzy match if necessary). If one clear match, auto-link; if multiple or unsure, ask the user to select from a shortlist.

- **Vendor Dashboard:**

  - For each vendor, allow a view that shows summary info: number of invoices this year, total spend, average days to pay, any credits, next payment date, etc. This is more analytical but useful.
  - At minimum, from a vendor record, show all related invoices.
  - Acceptance: Click a vendor, see list of invoices.

- **Permissions:** Possibly restrict who can see vendor banking info (maybe only AP Manager or Finance roles, not every AP clerk, to reduce exposure of sensitive data).
- **Integration for Payments Tracking:**

  - If a separate payment system is used, ensure vendor ID or details align so that when a payment is made, the AP system can match it to the vendor. This likely means when marking invoices as paid, the vendor info is consistent.
  - The AP system might generate payment files using vendor bank info; even if not executing payment, this info might be exported to the treasury system.
  - Acceptance: Simulate creating a payment file or sending data out with correct vendor bank fields populated.

- **Vendor Inactivation:** If a vendor is no longer used or found fraudulent, mark inactive so no new invoices can be processed. The system should warn or block usage of inactive vendors on new invoices.
- **Compliance & Audit:**

  - A report or log of vendor changes should be available (e.g., "Vendor Master Change Log" showing old and new values, user, timestamp).
  - Ensure this is stored for audit (SOX compliance: change management).
  - Acceptance: Change something on a vendor, then retrieve the log showing the change.

### 3.8 Payment Tracking (Status Monitoring)

**Feature Description:** Although actual **payment processing** (executing payments to vendors) is outside the scope of this AP system (likely handled by a treasury or ERP payment run), the AP Automation app must track the **status of payments** related to each invoice. This ensures the AP team and management have visibility into what has been paid, what is due, and if there were any issues with payments. Essentially, once invoices are approved, the system monitors them through the payment lifecycle via integration or manual updates.

Key functionalities:

- **Payment Status Fields:** Each invoice will have a payment status (as part of its workflow status as well, see table above). Key statuses: **Not Paid (or Pending)**, **Scheduled**, **Paid**, **Failed**, **Cancelled**.
- **Integration with Payment Systems:** The system should receive updates from the payment process:

  - If integrated with ERP: once a payment is executed in ERP (e.g., a check is cut or ACH sent), the ERP could send back payment date, reference (check number or transaction ID).
  - Integration could be real-time via API or batch (e.g., daily load of paid invoices).
  - For each invoice, store payment reference, date, and amount paid (partial payments scenario if possible).

- **Manual Update of Payment:** If not fully automated, AP Clerks can mark an invoice as paid and enter the reference (like check # or confirmation code) when they know the payment was done.
- **Dashboard of Due Invoices:** AP Managers should see what invoices are coming due (to ensure they get paid on time). Possibly a calendar view or just filters like “Due in next 7 days”.
- **Alerts for Overdue Payments:** If an invoice is past its due date and still not marked paid, alert responsible parties (AP Manager or maybe escalate to CFO for large ones). This helps avoid late fees or unhappy vendors.
- **Partial Payments / Installments:** If an invoice can be partially paid (not very common in AP, but maybe in disputes you pay part), the system should handle that – e.g., record \$500 paid of \$1000, and outstanding \$500. But typically, each invoice is paid in full. This might be used for complex scenarios or payment plans.
- **Reconciliation:** Ensure that the sum of all paid invoices matches what’s in the accounting books. This is more on accounting side but AP system should support any queries needed.
- **Payment Methods:** Track the method (ACH, Check, Wire) if possible, just for info. E.g., if an invoice is marked paid via check #12345 on 5/5/2025.
- **Error Handling:** If a payment fails (like an ACH return), mark invoice back to unpaid and flag issue. If a payment is cancelled (stop payment on a check), update status accordingly.
- **Vendor Communication:** Possibly note that remittance advice was sent to vendor (if the system sends any emails for that, or if ERP does, at least record that it was sent).
- **Reporting:** Ability to report total payments made in a period, or unpaid liabilities at a cutoff (AP aging).

**User Stories:**

- _As an AP Clerk, I want to quickly see if an invoice has been paid or not when a vendor calls asking about payment status, so I can give them an accurate update (and if paid, provide reference like check number)._
- _As an AP Manager, I want to be alerted if any approved invoice is approaching its due date but not yet scheduled or paid, so I can expedite it or investigate the delay to avoid late payment penalties._
- _As a CFO, I want to know at any point how much cash is required for accounts payable in the next week or month (based on due or scheduled invoices), to manage cash flow accordingly._
- _As an Internal Auditor, I want to ensure that every invoice marked as paid in the AP system corresponds to an actual payment transaction, and that no invoice can be marked as paid without a corresponding payment reference (to avoid false marking)._
- _As an IT Integrator, I want the AP system to automatically update invoice status to “Paid” when our ERP issues a payment, ensuring no manual update needed and data consistency between systems._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Payment Status Tracking Fields:**

  - Each invoice record has `PaymentStatus` (Pending, Paid, etc.), `PaymentDate`, `PaymentReference`, `PaymentMethod` fields.
  - Initially, upon invoice creation, `PaymentStatus` = Pending (not paid).
  - When invoice fully approved and waiting, maybe a sub-status like “Awaiting Payment”.
  - After payment, `PaymentStatus` = Paid, `PaymentDate` = actual date of payment, `Reference` = e.g., “ACH TXN 123ABC” or check number, method = e.g., ACH.

- **Integration Update:**

  - If ERP integration:

    - Simulate or test by having an API or file from ERP that lists paid invoices (vendor, invoice #, date, ref).
    - The AP system matches these and updates corresponding records.
    - If an invoice in AP system is marked approved and later appears in a paid list from ERP, AP system updates to Paid.
    - If an invoice is in AP as approved but not found in ERP by a certain time after due, that’s a red flag (maybe manual check needed).

  - Acceptable: Create a dummy "payment confirmation file" with one invoice info, run import, and see that invoice status flips to Paid with correct data.

- **Manual Marking:**

  - Provide UI for AP Clerk to mark payment. E.g., an “Mark as Paid” button on an approved invoice record (visible if the user has permission and if integration isn’t automatic).
  - It should prompt for date (default today), reference number, and maybe select method from dropdown.
  - Only allow if invoice is approved and not already marked paid.
  - If partial payment is allowed, have a field for amount paid and remaining. But likely simplest: full payment only, or if partial, the invoice stays not fully paid (some systems would split into a credit or adjustment).
  - Once marked, status to Paid and locked from further approval changes.
  - Acceptance: Mark an invoice through UI, confirm fields saved.

- **Due/Overdue Alerts:**

  - Business rule: if today > due date and not paid, that invoice is overdue.
  - The system should highlight overdue invoices (maybe in red in list).
  - Also send daily or weekly summary email to AP Manager listing any overdue invoices.
  - Similarly, maybe highlight invoices due within X days so they aren’t missed.
  - Acceptance: Set an invoice due yesterday, see that it’s flagged and included in an alert (simulate triggering an alert function).

- **Dashboard Info:**

  - On AP Manager dashboard, show counts: e.g., “10 invoices due this week (\$50k total), 2 overdue (\$5k)”.
  - On CFO dashboard or reports, show AP Aging: e.g., buckets of current, 1-30 days past due, etc., though in a good process ideally nothing is past due.
  - Provide a screen or report for “Cash Requirements”: list of all approved but not paid invoices sorted by due date.

- **Prevent Premature Paid Marking:**

  - The system should not allow marking an invoice as paid if it wasn’t approved. (That would circumvent controls).
  - If someone tries via an API or error, log it or throw exception.
  - Also, cannot mark as paid twice. If attempt to mark an already paid invoice, system should prevent duplicate or create a second payment record (depending).
  - Also ensure cancelled/rejected invoices can’t be marked as paid unless re-opened.

- **Failed Payments:**

  - If integration, catch signals like payment failed (some systems might send a specific code). If not, AP might have to manually mark fail.
  - Provide a way to mark payment failed: which would revert `PaymentStatus` to something like "Failed - Needs Attention".
  - The invoice then could be rescheduled or updated (maybe vendor bank info updated if that was the cause).
  - Acceptance: Mark an invoice as failed (simulate by an import file or UI action), see status and maybe an alert is raised "Payment failed for Invoice X, reason: (entered reason)".

- **Audit and Consistency:**

  - There should be a reconciliation report to ensure no invoice is stuck in an impossible state (like marked paid but still showing as approved pending in ERP, or vice versa).
  - Perhaps an automated daily check: any invoice marked paid in AP not found in ERP payment records triggers an alert, to catch any manual marking inconsistencies.
  - Acceptance: Introduce an inconsistency deliberately and see if system detects or at least it’s visible on a report.

### 3.9 Approval Process Configuration (Criteria-Based Approvals)

**Feature Description:** While we have discussed workflows broadly (Section 3.1), this section zeroes in on the **Approval Processes** – detailing how approvals are determined based on different criteria and how they can be configured. Approvals are a critical control in AP. The system needs to support **flexible approval hierarchies**: for example, approvals based on **invoice amount**, on **invoice type or category**, on **dates or urgency**, or on **vendor** (some vendors might require special handling). This feature overlaps with workflow but focuses on the rules and management of approval policies.

Key functionalities:

- **Approval Matrix / Rules Engine:** A configuration interface to set up approval rules:

  - By amount thresholds (e.g., invoices < \$1,000 require 1 approval by manager; \$1,000-\$10,000 require manager + finance director; > \$10,000 require manager + director + CFO).
  - By department or cost center (e.g., route to that dept’s manager for first approval).
  - By invoice type (maybe capital expenditure invoices need approval by capital projects team, etc.).
  - By vendor (rare, but maybe invoices from a new vendor or a high-risk vendor require extra scrutiny).
  - By date/urgency (if something is marked urgent maybe skip some steps but then CFO notified).

- **Multiple Approval Chains:** Support sequential (one after another) or parallel approvals (two people can approve in any order, both required). Possibly support “either/or” (one of a group can approve, like any one of finance managers).
- **Dynamic Approver Determination:** Integration with org hierarchy to find “manager of X” or things like that. If a user submits an invoice (or if the invoice is tied to an employee, say an expense reimbursement, though that’s more T\&E than AP), route to that employee’s manager.
- **Delegation:** Approvers can delegate their authority when on vacation (set out-of-office alternate, so approvals route to delegate in that period).
- **Escalation:** If an approver doesn’t act within a specified time, auto-escalate to their manager or backup. This was touched in workflow (notifications), but here formal escalation rule can reassign the task.
- **Approval UI:** Approvers get a simple interface: list of invoices pending their approval, each with key details and link to view the document. They can Approve or Reject (with comment). They might also have option to send back for more info.
- **Criteria Examples:**

  - **Amount:** The system should allow tiered approvals as described. Possibly a table setup: e.g., Tier 1: up to \$1000 – Manager; Tier 2: \$1000-\$10000 – Manager + Director; Tier 3: \$10000+ – Manager + Director + CFO.
  - **Category:** E.g., all invoices tagged as “Legal Fees” also require Legal department approval.
  - **Project:** If invoice associated with a project code, have project manager approve.

- **Out-of-Scope Approvals:** Some invoices might already be “approved” in other ways (for example, a PO-based invoice may not need separate approval if matched and within PO, depending on company policy). The system should be configurable to skip or auto-approve in those cases to avoid redundant approvals.
- **Audit & Compliance:** Ensure no invoice that exceeds a user’s approval limit can be approved by them alone – enforce limits. Also keep a record of who approved with timestamp (which is part of audit trail).
- **Simulate/Preview Workflows:** Maybe an AP manager can input a scenario (invoice X amount for dept Y) and see who would be approvers to verify rules are set correctly.
- **Changes to Approvals:** If an invoice’s data changes (like amount updated), it may need to restart or adjust approvals (if amount increased into a higher tier). The system should handle re-evaluating the rules if a change occurs before final approval.

**User Stories:**

- _As a Product Manager (of AP system, i.e., our persona AP Manager), I want to configure different approval routes based on invoice value thresholds so that the right level of management is approving high-cost items and we’re not wasting time with senior management on tiny expenses._
- _As an AP Clerk, I want the system to automatically know who needs to approve a given invoice, so I just click “Start Approval” and it routes appropriately, without me manually emailing or figuring out the org chart._
- _As an Approver (Department Manager), I want to receive a notification and have a simple way to approve invoices for my department even when I’m out of the office (e.g., via mobile or delegating to my assistant), ensuring approvals don’t bottleneck._
- _As a CFO, I want assurance that no invoice above my set limit gets paid without my approval, and that I don’t have to approve trivial amounts – the system should enforce those rules exactly._
- _As an Internal Auditor, I want to verify that the system’s approval workflow ensures compliance with our delegation of authority matrix (a SOX key control), and that any override of the approval process is documented._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Approval Rule Setup:**

  - The system provides an interface to set at least:

    - Amount thresholds and corresponding required approvers (by role or name).
    - Possibly an upload of an “approval matrix” or form-based entry for multiple rules.

  - Must handle overlapping rules logically (the system should decide the most restrictive path if multiple apply).
  - Example: Setup rule: “If Amount > \$5000, add CFO as approver”. Test: create an invoice \$6000, ensure CFO is in the chain.

- **Dynamic Role Resolution:**

  - If a rule says "Department Head approval", ensure the system knows who that is. Likely requires mapping user roles to departments.
  - Acceptable if either the invoice has a department field and that maps to an approver, or you pick department during coding.
  - Test: an invoice coded to Dept 100, system finds user John is Dept 100 manager, assigns to John.
  - If John has delegated to someone else (see delegation below), then assignment goes to delegate accordingly.

- **Sequential vs Parallel:**

  - Implement sequential as default (one after one in order given).
  - For parallel, a rule might say e.g. "Legal and Finance must both approve". The system should send to both simultaneously and only move forward when both have approved.
  - UI should indicate who has approved and who is pending in parallel scenario.
  - Test: set a parallel requirement, simulate one approval, ensure invoice waits for other.

- **Delegation:**

  - Approvers can set a delegate user and a date range.
  - If an invoice arrives in that period, it should assign to delegate (and maybe CC original).
  - If already assigned to original and they set delegate after, might auto reassign or at least give delegate access to their queue.
  - Test: Approver A delegates to B, send an invoice to A, see that B gets it instead.

- **Escalation:**

  - Configure an escalation, e.g., "if approval not done in 3 days, escalate to X".
  - The system should then reassign or notify the next level.
  - Test by not acting on an approval for the set time (simulate via a job that triggers escalations), see that it's reassigned or at least an email to the next person.

- **Approver UI:**

  - Approver login should see a list "Invoices awaiting your approval".
  - Each item shows basics (vendor, amount, maybe the account or description).
  - Approver can click to view details and the document.
  - They must have Approve or Reject buttons, possibly a field for comments (especially on reject they should give reason).
  - After approval, it's removed from their list and goes to next step.
  - If reject, removed from list and invoice goes back to AP with status Rejected and comment visible.
  - The UI should also allow bulk if many small ones (like approve all selected), if that’s safe to do (maybe rarely needed if each is to be looked at).
  - Test: Approver approves an invoice, status updates, next approver gets notified or if none, invoice finalized.

- **Override Mechanism:**

  - In rare cases, maybe CFO wants to force approve something even if another approver hasn't (due to urgency). The system could allow an admin (or CFO role) to override outstanding approvals and mark as approved. But this should be heavily logged with reason.
  - Only if business demands it; otherwise, encourage normal flow.
  - If implemented: test that CFO can hit an override button and invoice is marked approved, but log says "Manually overridden by CFO user on date".

- **No Bypass of Limits:**

  - Try scenario: Manager has limit \$5k, invoice \$7k. Manager tries to approve (their part), should still require that CFO also approve. The manager alone cannot fully approve it.
  - If manager is final step erroneously, system should block marking invoice fully approved because CFO step was missing. So config must catch that.
  - For any invoice, check that sum of approval limits of those who approved covers invoice amount. Ideally, design ensures correct routing so this situation doesn’t happen at all.

- **Notification & Reminders:**

  - Approvers get an email for each assignment (could batch if many, or immediate).
  - Reminder email if pending after X days (like escalations or just courtesy reminder).
  - Possibly a daily digest if a lot of items.
  - Test by assigning an invoice, intercept email or see log that email sent.

- **Audit Log:**

  - Each approval action recorded: "Approved by X (role Y) on timestamp", "Rejected by Z on timestamp with comment 'reason'".
  - If rules added CFO automatically, maybe note "CFO approval required per rule (>\$10k)" somewhere for clarity.
  - Provide an export of approval history if needed for audit.

### 3.10 Integration with Accounting, ERP, and CPM Systems

**Feature Description:** Integration is a vital component of the AP Automation SaaS. The application must seamlessly **integrate with external systems** such as accounting software, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, and Corporate Performance Management (CPM) platforms. The objective is to avoid duplicate data entry, ensure consistency between systems, and allow AP data to flow into financial records and reports. Key integration points include vendor data, purchase orders, invoice data (for posting to the GL), and payment status updates.

Key integration capabilities:

- **ERP/Accounting System Integration:**

  - **Vendor Master Sync:** As mentioned, regularly sync vendor data between ERP and AP system.
  - **Purchase Order (PO) Data:** Real-time or scheduled import of PO data for matching. Possibly on-demand fetch when an invoice with a given PO is processed.
  - **GL Account & Cost Center Master Data:** Import list of valid GL codes, cost centers, project codes, etc., to use in invoice coding (to ensure that when exporting, data is valid).
  - **Invoice Export / Voucher Posting:** Once an invoice is fully approved, the AP system should send the financial information to the accounting/ERP system to record the liability. This could be:

    - Creating a voucher or AP entry in the ERP with vendor, amount, accounting distribution, due date.
    - Could be via API or file (e.g., generate an XML or CSV that ERP imports).
    - If ERP is the system of record for financials, this step ensures the books reflect the invoice even if payment not done yet.

  - **Payment Status Import:** As described, bring payment confirmations from ERP (or from bank if ERP not doing payments).

- **CPM (Corporate Performance Management) Integration:**

  - CPM systems (like planning/budgeting tools) might want data on AP liabilities for cash flow forecasting. Provide an interface or feed for CPM to fetch open payables, etc.
  - Alternatively, if company uses CPM to analyze spend, maybe push data of invoices into CPM’s data store.

- **API and Webhooks:**

  - Provide a **REST API** for key operations: create invoice, update invoice status, get invoice data, etc., to allow custom integration or third-party tools to interact.
  - Provide **webhooks** for events: e.g., when an invoice is approved or paid, send a webhook so another system can act (if needed).

- **Pre-built Connectors:** If targeting common software, have connectors for e.g., QuickBooks, Xero (SMB accounting), and for larger ERP like SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, NetSuite. At least define how integration will work for each (via API or file).
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Integration with corporate SSO/IdP (like Azure AD, Okta) to simplify login for users, which isn't data integration but important for enterprise readiness.
- **Data Import/Export Utilities:** If full automation is not possible for a particular client’s system, provide ability to manually import/export via files as fallback (e.g., CSV of invoices to import to ERP).
- **Error Handling & Sync Monitoring:** If an integration fails (e.g., ERP API down, or data mismatch), the system should log it and alert IT. Provide a way to retry or fix data.
- **Real-time vs Batch:** Aim for real-time or near-real-time sync where possible (like vendor and PO queries on demand, posting immediately). But also allow scheduled nightly syncs for some data if needed (some systems batch-process).
- **Security:** Data in integration must be secure (use HTTPS APIs, secure file transfer). Also, obey least privilege – e.g., if using an ERP API user, ensure they only can access needed endpoints (like create vendor invoice, read PO, not everything).
- **Compliance & Logging:** All data transfers should be logged (what was sent/received when, success/fail) to support troubleshooting and audit trails.

**User Stories:**

- _As an IT Integration Specialist, I want the AP system to automatically send newly approved invoices to our ERP (SAP) so that our general ledger and financial reports include those liabilities without manual entry._
- _As an AP Manager, I want any new purchase orders created in our ERP procurement module to be available in the AP system for matching, so that when the invoice comes in, it can be matched immediately._
- _As a CFO, I want our financial planning system to get data on all approved payables and their due dates, so our cash flow forecasts in the CPM tool are accurate and up-to-date._
- _As an AP Clerk, if I update something like the coding or fix a mistake on an invoice in the AP system, I want that update to synchronize to the accounting system record, so we don’t have inconsistencies._
- _As a Security/Compliance Officer, I want to ensure that integrating this SaaS with our on-prem ERP does not open security holes – data must be encrypted, and only necessary data is exchanged, meeting our IT compliance requirements._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Vendor Sync:**

  - On a regular interval (e.g., nightly) or via trigger, the AP system updates its vendor list from ERP.
  - No vendor that is not in ERP should be used without either adding it to ERP or marking it specifically as AP-only (depending on process).
  - Test: add a vendor in ERP, run sync, see it in AP system. Disable a vendor in ERP, see it marked inactive in AP system.

- **PO Fetch:**

  - Given an invoice with PO 123, the system can call ERP API like `/api/getPO?number=123` (example) to fetch details.
  - It must map the data correctly (line items etc. for matching).
  - If no API, a daily file of open POs can be imported. Then AP uses its local copy.
  - Test either method: verify a known PO’s data appears in the AP system when needed.

- **Invoice Export to ERP:**

  - After final approval, the AP system should transmit an “Invoice Approval/Payment Request” to ERP.
  - If API: call something like `/api/APInvoices` with JSON of invoice (vendor ID, date, amount, due, lines with GL accounts).
  - If file: generate a batch file perhaps grouping multiple invoices (some ERPs import an XML or IDoc file etc.).
  - Ensure each invoice is flagged as exported to avoid duplicates.
  - Then, in ERP, that invoice becomes a posted payable (usually as an open item in AP module with its own voucher number).
  - If the ERP returns an ID, store that (like ERP voucher number).
  - Acceptance: simulate API by capturing request payload for a test invoice, ensure it contains correct data. If direct test with a sandbox ERP, verify invoice appears in ERP.

- **Payment Confirmation Import:**

  - E.g., ERP after a payment run could provide a list: vendor, invoice #, paid date, amount, payment ref.
  - AP system ingests this (either via API or file).
  - Mark corresponding invoices as Paid.
  - If any invoice in AP is not found in confirmation for too long after due, highlight it.
  - Test: feed a sample "payment done" message to AP system, see status change.

- **API Availability:**

  - Provide API endpoints like:

    - `POST /invoices` to create an invoice.
    - `GET /invoices/{id}` to retrieve invoice data (including status and maybe a link to the image).
    - `GET /invoices` (with query params for filtering maybe).
    - `PUT /invoices/{id}` for updates (like marking paid, or updating status).
    - `POST /vendors` or `GET /vendors` as needed (or rely on ERP sync primarily).
    - Possibly `POST /invoices/{id}/approve` if wanting to trigger an approval via API (though likely not needed, UI/Email covers that).

  - The API should require authentication (API keys or OAuth with proper scopes).
  - Test with a dummy client: create an invoice via API, see it in UI; update via API, etc.

- **Webhooks:**

  - e.g., allow registering a webhook for events: "invoice.approved", "invoice.paid" etc.
  - Then test that an event triggers a call to a test endpoint with relevant data. This helps things like notifying a Slack channel or another app if desired.

- **Pre-built Connectors:**

  - For example, QuickBooks Online – the AP system could use QBO's API to sync vendors and post bills. If targeted, we must ensure mapping is right:

    - QB requires vendor name match and certain fields; test posting an invoice to a QuickBooks test account via their API (if available).

  - For SAP – likely via file or middleware (IDoc integration).
  - Document any differences in integration per target system, but overall approach is similar.

- **SSO Integration:**

  - If required by clients, ensure SAML or OAuth SSO integration is available and testable. Not directly AP data, but needed for enterprise adoption.
  - Acceptance: login via an IdP test account, confirm user mapping and roles.

- **Error Handling:**

  - Simulate an integration error: e.g., ERP API is down when trying to post invoice – the system should queue the invoice for retry and notify IT that posting failed (with error details).
  - There should be a screen listing any failed integrations for manual intervention if needed.
  - Data validation: if ERP rejects an invoice because of invalid account or closed period, AP system should catch that response and display an error so AP can fix (maybe change date or account).
  - Acceptance: try sending an invoice with bad data to see the error path.

- **Security:**

  - All integration data in transit must be encrypted (HTTPS or SFTP). No plain text file transfers via email etc.
  - Credentials for integration (API keys, FTP creds) stored securely (encrypted in config).
  - Ensure that if an integration user is compromised, the damage is limited (e.g., API user can’t delete data, just add/update needed fields).
  - Possibly allow IP whitelisting for API access if needed by client IT.

- **Throughput:** Integration processes should not bottleneck overall flow. For example, posting to ERP one by one might be slow if hundreds of invoices; maybe group or ensure it can run async. In high volume cases, ensure integration can keep up (maybe posting can be multi-threaded or at least not lock user actions).
- **Documentation:** Provide integration specification documents for clients' IT teams, detailing the data fields, formats, and any configuration needed on their side. (Not a software requirement per se, but needed deliverable.)

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

In addition to the functional capabilities described, the AP Automation SaaS application must meet several **non-functional requirements** to ensure it is robust, secure, and user-friendly. These are critical for the system’s success in a production environment, especially given financial data and compliance requirements. Non-functional aspects include security, performance, scalability, reliability, usability, and maintainability, among others.

### 4.1 Security

Security is paramount for a financial system dealing with invoices and potentially sensitive vendor information (bank details, tax IDs). The application must enforce **strict security measures** at all levels:

- **Authentication & Authorization:**

  - Support secure login, including **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for users, especially for those with higher privileges (administrators, CFO).
  - Integrate with **Single Sign-On (SSO)** providers (as mentioned in integration) to leverage corporate authentication policies.
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define roles (e.g., AP Clerk, AP Manager, Approver, Auditor, Admin) and ensure users only see and do what their role permits. For instance, an approver might not have access to edit vendor master, an AP clerk might not delete records, etc.

- **Data Encryption:**

  - All data in transit must be encrypted via TLS (HTTPS for web interface and API).
  - Data at rest: encrypt sensitive fields in the database (like vendor bank accounts) and/or full-disk encryption on servers. Use proven encryption standards (AES-256, etc.).

- **Secure Coding Practices:**

  - Protect against OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.). Use input validation throughout (e.g., if an invoice number is input, ensure it’s free of malicious script).
  - Conduct regular security audits or code scans.

- **Audit Trails & Logging:**

  - As mentioned, maintain logs of all key actions (login attempts, data changes, approvals, etc.). These logs should be tamper-evident; maybe write to append-only store or external audit log service.
  - Ability to review logs by security admin if needed (for investigating any suspicious activity).

- **Data Isolation:** For a multi-tenant SaaS (if multiple companies use the same system), ensure complete data isolation between tenants. No one company’s user can ever see another’s data.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Keep regular backups of data (in encrypted form) in case of disasters. And have a disaster recovery plan (like failover to another region).
- **Compliance Standards:**

  - If applicable, comply with data protection regulations: e.g., GDPR (if EU vendor personal data), which means giving ability to delete or anonymize vendor personal data if required (though invoices might be exempt if needed for financial record).
  - SOX: ensure the controls (like access control and log integrity) meet SOX IT general controls.
  - PCI DSS: If credit card info were handled (likely not in AP context), but if any bank info maybe treat carefully (though PCI is more for card data).

- **Penetration Testing:** Before go-live, conduct pen tests to find vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Integrations:** Make sure API endpoints require auth, and file transfer uses secure channels.
- **Session Management:** Auto-logout idle sessions, protect session cookies, etc. Possibly IP-based restrictions if needed (maybe restrict access to corporate network if desired by client).
- **Authorization Example:** Only users with "Approver" role assigned to an invoice’s department can approve that invoice; others even if they find it via search should not be able to approve or edit it.
- **Vendor Portal Security (if built later):** If vendors can access their data, ensure they only see their own invoices, likely via a separate portal with limited functionality.

### 4.2 Performance

Performance requirements ensure the system responds quickly and can handle the expected workload:

- **UI Response Time:** For common user actions (opening invoice lists, search, viewing an invoice, approving an invoice), the system should respond within **2-3 seconds** for most operations. Heavy reports or bulk operations might be slightly longer, but the aim is to keep interactive use snappy. No user likes waiting on a slow system especially when processing large volumes daily.
- **Processing Speed:** As noted, OCR and workflow processing should be efficient. For instance, processing an invoice from scan to ready-for-approval ideally within 1-2 minutes, to avoid long backlogs. Real-time matching and validation when an invoice is opened.
- **Throughput & Concurrency:**

  - The system should handle at least e.g. **100 invoices per minute** processing throughput in peak times (assuming sufficient hardware scaling in SaaS environment).
  - Support e.g. **200 concurrent active users** with no significant degradation (numbers can be adjusted based on target customer size, but design for a healthy concurrency).

- **Scalability:** The application should scale horizontally on the server side (especially for OCR and background tasks). If more documents need processing, we should be able to add more worker nodes.

  - If a client doubles their invoice volume next year, we scale infra to maintain performance.
  - Use async processing and queueing to smooth out spikes.

- **Network:** Optimize data transferred to client (like don’t load 10MB images if not needed, maybe load lower-res preview for quick view). Use pagination to avoid sending huge lists.
- **Performance Testing:** Conduct load tests to verify the system meets these metrics, e.g., simulate 1000 invoices being ingested in an hour and 50 approvers working simultaneously.
- **Capacity Planning:** Document how many invoices or how much data the system can handle in a single tenant environment and overall, so sales know what scale is fine. Possibly target mid-market vs enterprise volume differences.
- **Database Performance:** Use indexing, efficient queries for search as mentioned. Ensure that even with millions of records, queries use indexes.
- **OCR Performance:** Possibly allow heavy OCR tasks to offload to background thread or separate service so UI is not blocked. If OCR is slow, at least user can continue working on other stuff.
- **File Storage:** The system should efficiently store and retrieve large files (some scanned invoices can be multi-MB if high DPI). Consider using a CDN or caching for frequently accessed documents if needed.

### 4.3 Scalability and Availability

- **Scalability:**

  - The SaaS should be built cloud-natively to leverage auto-scaling. For example, run on a cloud platform (AWS/Azure/GCP) where additional instances of services can spin up under load.
  - Partition workloads: maybe separate services for web app, OCR service, database, etc., to scale them independently.
  - Data partitioning if needed (though per company multi-tenant DB or separate DB per client decisions can affect scale).

- **Availability/Uptime:**

  - Target high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime or better SLA). Achieve this via redundant servers, clustering the database, using multiple availability zones/regions.
  - The system should not have a single point of failure. Implement load balancers, and failover for DB.
  - In case of component outage (e.g., OCR engine down), degrade gracefully (system still accessible, just can't process new invoices until failover or fix).

- **Maintenance:**

  - Plan maintenance windows if needed, but aim for seamless updates (zero-downtime deploys if possible).
  - Notify users of any expected downtime if absolutely needed.

- **Disaster Recovery:**

  - Have a DR plan: e.g., replicate data to a second region. If primary region goes down (rare but possible), be able to restore service in secondary within X hours (maybe RTO of a few hours, RPO of a few minutes).
  - Test DR by simulations.

- **Multi-Tenancy vs Single:**

  - If multi-tenant, ensure one client’s heavy usage doesn’t starve others – maybe use separate queues or throttle if needed.
  - For very large enterprise clients, might consider offering a dedicated instance if needed for performance.

- **Growth:**

  - We should state that the product can handle growth in user base and document volume for at least 5 years of foreseeable use without rearchitecture (just adding resources).
  - e.g., from initial 50k invoices/year to 200k/year by scaling up hardware.

### 4.4 Usability and UX

Usability is crucial for adoption since AP staff may not all be tech-savvy, and they use this daily:

- **Intuitive Interface:** Design the UI with **clarity** – e.g., a dashboard that highlights what needs attention (invoices to process or approve) prominently. Use clear labels and common AP terminology.
- **Minimal Training Required:** The goal is that a new AP clerk or approver can start using the system with minimal training. For instance, approving an invoice via email link should be straightforward and maybe not even require full login (could have email approvals if secure).
- **Consistency:** Ensure consistency in design (all lists work similarly, actions like approve, reject always in same place).
- **Shortcuts:** Provide keyboard shortcuts or bulk actions for power users (like select all, approve).
- **Accessibility:** Aim for compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) so that users with disabilities (e.g., visual impairments) can use screen readers, navigate via keyboard, etc.
- **Multi-language UI:** If deploying globally, consider localization of the interface into multiple languages. At least, ensure it’s technically possible to translate strings.
- **Feedback and Confirmation:** When users take actions (like approving or submitting an invoice), give immediate feedback (e.g., a success message, the item disappears from their queue, etc.) so they know it worked.
- **Error Messages:** Should be clear and helpful, not codes. E.g., “You cannot approve this invoice because you have reached your approval limit. It has been forwarded to the next approver.” rather than a generic error.
- **Mobile/Responsive:** Approvers often want to approve on the go. Ensure the web app is responsive on mobile or provide a dedicated mobile app for approvals and basic functions. This dramatically improves efficiency (approvals don’t wait for someone to get back from travel).
- **Documentation and Help:** Provide in-app help or tooltips, and a user guide or knowledge base for reference. Possibly contextual help icons near complex features (like “What is 3-way match?” tooltip).
- **User Preferences:** Allow minor customizations like saving filters, choosing default dashboard view, email notification preferences (e.g., immediate vs daily summary).
- **Performance in UX:** As mentioned, speed is part of UX. Also avoid clutter; show loading spinners if something is loading; don't freeze.
- **Approver Simplicity:** Make it easy for approvers who only occasionally login. Possibly allow email approvals where the email contains enough info and an approve/reject button (with secure token). But if not, ensure that once they login they can find their items quickly.

### 4.5 Auditability and Compliance

Given financial data and SOX/GAAP considerations, the system must be fully auditable and help the company remain compliant:

- **Audit Logs:** As described, every significant action is logged with who, when, and what changed. This includes:

  - Invoice data changes (amount edits, coding changes).
  - Workflow actions (approvals, reassignments).
  - Vendor info changes.
  - Login attempts (especially failures).
  - Integration actions (like if data was sent to ERP).

- **Report for Auditors:** Possibly create an “Audit Report” feature:

  - For a given time period, list of all invoices above a threshold and who approved them (to show compliance with delegation of authority).
  - Changes made after approval (should normally not happen).
  - Any overrides or forced actions.
  - Vendor changes log.
  - This helps internal or external auditors quickly get what they need.

- **Financial Compliance:**

  - **GAAP**: Ensure that the system supports GAAP compliance by proper cutoff handling (e.g., if an invoice is dated in prior period but received late, the system allows marking it for proper accrual perhaps). This is more process, but system could facilitate accrual reporting for period-end (list of invoices received after close that belong to prior period).
  - **SOX**: Sarbanes-Oxley requires internal controls; this system directly addresses AP controls:

    - Ensuring no single person can create and approve a fake invoice (segregation of duties enforced).
    - Maintaining evidence of approvals and match (the audit trail).
    - If integrated, reducing risk of manual errors in financial reporting (since automated transfer to GL).
    - The system itself should be evaluated in SOX audits, so we provide documentation of its control features and any ITGCs (like how access is controlled, how changes are made to the system – config changes should require certain roles etc.).

- **Retention & Legal Compliance:**

  - By law, financial documents may need to be retained for X years (7 years is common in many jurisdictions, but it could vary).
  - The system’s retention policy configuration ensures invoices are not purged too soon. Typically, don’t delete any unless admin does it for compliance after many years.
  - If operating in multiple countries, be aware of local e-invoicing requirements. For instance, some countries require invoices to be archived in specific formats or reported to tax authorities. Not core here, but design with flexibility (maybe integration hook for those).

- **SOX 404 evidence:** The company’s SOX compliance team might want to test this system. We should ensure:

  - The list of who can approve what is clearly documented (and ideally, the system can export that config).
  - The modifications to workflows require certain roles (so an AP clerk can’t secretly change the workflow to avoid CFO approval).
  - If any config changes (like threshold change) that could affect control, log it and maybe require dual approval for that change (meta-approval for config).

- **Data Integrity:** Ensure that once an invoice is marked paid and the period is closed, no changes happen to amounts. Any adjustments have to be via credit/debit notes. This prevents data tampering after the fact. Lock period data if needed (tie into ERP’s period closing schedule).
- **Compliance Standards References:**

  - _SOX Internal Controls:_ The system supports strong internal controls over AP, aiding SOX 404 compliance by providing secure data capture, automated checks, and comprehensive records.
  - _GAAP:_ By ensuring all transactions are recorded with appropriate documentation and approval, the system helps companies adhere to GAAP’s principles of completeness and accuracy in financial reporting. It also supports **full disclosure** by retaining documents and notes that explain financial transactions.
  - _Audit Trail Integrity:_ Possibly use features like append-only logs or digital signatures on documents to prove they weren’t altered (if high security needed).

- **GDPR/Data Privacy:** In case any personal data (like a contact person’s name/email) is in the system, comply with privacy laws for protecting that data and removing if requested (though business context might be exempt, still need to consider).

### 4.6 Maintainability and Extensibility

- **Modular Architecture:** Build the system in a modular way so that components can be updated or replaced (e.g., could swap out OCR engine, or integrate a new ERP easily by adding a module).
- **Configuration over Custom Code:** Many business rules (approval rules, tolerances, etc.) should be configurable through the UI or config files, not requiring code changes for each company’s policy. This makes it flexible for different clients and easier to maintain.
- **Clear Code and Documentation:** Internally, code should be well-documented. External API documentation should be clear for integrators.
- **Testing:** Have a comprehensive automated test suite (unit, integration, UI tests) to catch regressions. Particularly important for financial systems to avoid errors.
- **Deployment:** Use CI/CD pipelines to deploy updates regularly, with ability to rollback if an issue.
- **Support and Monitoring:** Provide admin tools to monitor the system health (jobs queue, integration status, etc.). If something goes wrong, support can identify quickly (e.g., a dashboard that shows all systems operational or not).
- **Extensibility:** The design should allow adding new features like a vendor portal, dynamic discounting (if one day want to add early payment discounts logic), or integration with new services (maybe blockchain invoice ledger, etc.) with minimal rework.

## 5. Functional Diagrams and Workflow Illustrations

This section provides diagrams and flow illustrations to visualize key processes described in the requirements. These help in understanding the sequence of operations and integration points for the AP Automation system.

### 5.1 End-to-End Invoice Processing Flow

**Figure 5.1: End-to-End AP Invoice Workflow** (from invoice receipt to payment)

1. **Invoice Receipt:** A supplier sends an invoice (via mail, email, EDI, etc.). If paper, it is scanned into the AP system; if email/PDF, it’s forwarded into the system.
2. **Document Capture & OCR:** The system captures the invoice image and extracts data using OCR. The invoice is now in the system with key fields recognized.
3. **Verification & Coding:** An AP Clerk reviews the extracted data, corrects any errors, and assigns GL codes or links to a PO if not already linked. The invoice record is saved with all necessary info.
4. **3-Way Match Check:** If a PO is associated, the system automatically compares the invoice to the PO and receiving data:

   - If matched, it moves forward.
   - If discrepancies, it goes to an exception loop (AP clerk or buyer resolves discrepancy, possibly communicating with vendor).

5. **Approval Workflow:** The invoice, once verified (and matched if applicable), enters the approval workflow. Based on amount and rules, it is routed to the appropriate manager(s) for approval.

   - Approvers review the invoice details and either approve or reject (with comments).
   - If rejected, it goes back to AP for correction or cancellation.
   - All approvals are logged.

6. **Approved & Posting:** After final approval, the invoice is marked as **Approved** in the AP system. The system then posts the invoice to the accounting system (creating a payable entry in ERP) via integration.
7. **Payment Scheduling:** The invoice is scheduled for payment according to terms (or as manually set by AP). It waits until the due date or next payment run.
8. **Payment Execution (External):** The ERP or payment system issues the payment (ACH transfer, check, etc.) to the supplier on the scheduled date.
9. **Payment Confirmation:** The AP system receives confirmation of payment (through integration) and updates the invoice status to **Paid** with payment details.
10. **Archive & Reporting:** The invoice is stored in the repository for future reference. The data is available for reporting (AP aging, spend analysis) and the document is retained for compliance.

Each step above corresponds to various system modules: Document Capture (Step 2), Matching Engine (Step 4), Workflow Engine (Step 5), Integration module (Steps 6 & 9), etc.

### 5.2 Integration Data Flow

**Figure 5.2: Integration Flow with ERP and Other Systems**

```
 [ERP System] <---(Vendor Master Sync)---> [AP Automation SaaS] <---(Invoice Export)---> [ERP System]

 [ERP Procurement] --(PO Data Feed/API)---> [AP Automation SaaS] --(Approved Invoice Posting)--> [ERP Financials]

 [Bank/Treasury] --(Payment Status)---> [ERP/AP SaaS] --(Payment Confirmation)---> [AP Automation SaaS]

 [CPM/BI Tool] <---(Open AP Data Export)---> [AP Automation SaaS]
```

- Vendor data flows from ERP to the AP system to ensure consistency.
- Purchase Orders from Procurement/ERP flow into AP system for matching.
- Approved invoices flow back to ERP’s financial module (Accounts Payable) to record liabilities.
- Payment execution happens in ERP or a banking system; status flows back to mark invoices paid.
- Reporting tools or CPM systems can fetch data from AP system (or ERP) about liabilities for analysis.

All integrations use secure channels (e.g., APIs or secure file transfers). The AP Automation SaaS acts as a hub in the payables process, but final financial records and cash movements happen in the ERP and bank.

_(The above diagram is conceptual; actual integration may use middleware or an iPaaS platform, but the data exchanges are as indicated.)_

### 5.3 Workflow Diagram: Approval Process Example

**Figure 5.3: Example Approval Workflow based on amount**

```
 Invoice "INV-2025-0001" (Amount $12,000) arrives ->
   System checks rules: $12k > $10k threshold ->
   Required approvals: Manager + Director + CFO.

 Workflow:
 [AP Clerk] --> (Submits Invoice for Approval) --> [Department Manager] --(approves)--> [Director] --(approves)--> [CFO] --(approves)--> (Approved for Payment)
```

In this example:

- The AP Clerk initiates the workflow after processing the invoice.
- The Department Manager is first approver (perhaps identified by department code on invoice).
- Once Manager approves, the Director is notified (next in chain).
- After Director, CFO gets it (since amount > \$10k).
- CFO approves => invoice status becomes Approved.
- If any level rejects, it goes back to AP Clerk to review.
- If CFO was not required (say invoice was \$5k), the workflow would have ended at Director.

This diagram illustrates a sequential approval. The system handles the routing and notifications at each step automatically.

_(Note: For brevity, not showing parallel or conditional branches, but the workflow engine can handle e.g., skipping CFO if not needed or adding extra approvals for specific cases as configured.)_

### 5.4 System Component Diagram (High-Level Architecture)

_(This section gives a high-level view of system components - useful for understanding how the pieces interact.)_

**Components:**

- **User Interface (Web & Mobile):** Where AP Clerks and Managers interact via browser (and possibly a mobile app for approvals).
- **Workflow Engine:** Manages the routing of tasks and enforcement of rules.
- **OCR Engine:** Service that processes images for text extraction.
- **Business Rules Module:** Handles matching logic, validations (tolerances, duplicate checks).
- **Integration Adapter:** Handles communication with external systems (ERP connectors, APIs).
- **Database:** Stores all transactional data (invoices, vendors, etc.) and configuration.
- **Document Storage:** Stores invoice images/files (could be cloud storage).
- **Notification Service:** Sends emails or messages for approvals and alerts.
- **Security Module:** Authentication, roles, audit logs.

**Interaction:**

1. User submits or scans an invoice -> UI calls backend -> Document stored, OCR engine processes.
2. OCR returns data -> Business Rules validate -> Database saves invoice, triggers matching routine.
3. If match fails, marks exception -> AP Clerk notified via UI to fix.
4. If successful, workflow engine kicks off -> sends notifications to approvers via Notification service.
5. Approvers take action via UI or email -> Workflow engine updates status -> once final, triggers integration.
6. Integration adapter sends invoice data to ERP -> ERP processes and later sends payment info back -> adapter updates status in DB.
7. Throughout, Security module ensures only authorized actions, and Audit logs are written for each step.

_(A visual diagram could be included to show these components in boxes and arrows, but in text form we have described the flow.)_

## 6. Best Practices & Compliance References

This section references industry **best practices** and compliance guidelines that inform the requirements:

- **Invoice Automation Best Practices:** Automate data capture and workflow to reduce manual entry and errors. Use 3-way matching to prevent fraudulent or incorrect payments. Leverage early payment discounts by speeding up approvals (this could be a future feature).
- **Accounts Payable Internal Controls:** Enforce segregation of duties in the AP process (the system does this by requiring separate approvers). Implement positive pay or other check controls if checks are used. Log changes to vendor info to detect fraud.
- **SOX Compliance:** Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires controls over financial reporting. The AP process is typically in scope for SOX 404. By automating and logging approvals and matches, the system helps satisfy controls over authorized payments and accurate recording. For instance, SOX requires retaining evidence that invoice payments are approved by responsible officials; our electronic approvals serve as that evidence.
- **GAAP Compliance:** According to GAAP, expenses should be recorded in the period incurred (matching principle). Our system can facilitate proper recording by integrating with ERP for accruals. Also, GAAP requires **full disclosure** and documentation; keeping invoice images and notes linked to transactions supports that.
- **Regulatory Compliance:**

  - If operating in certain industries or regions, comply with specific regulations like **VAT invoice requirements in EU**, or **1099 reporting in US** (system should capture if a vendor needs a 1099 form, which is related to AP).
  - Ensure data privacy like GDPR if vendor data includes personal info.

- **Audit Readiness:** The system is designed to be audit-friendly. Auditors can trace any transaction from the financial statements back to source invoice in the repository quickly (sometimes called “invoice to GL” trace). Audit sampling can be done via system queries rather than paper.
- **Business Continuity:** Use cloud best practices for uptime. Maintain an audit of system access (who can administer the system) as part of ITGC audits.
- **Integration Best Practice:** Use API where possible for real-time sync to avoid latency. For example, an **API-first approach** ensures the system can communicate with many platforms.
- **User Experience:** AP automation should simplify AP workload and not introduce complexity; thus we design with user-centric approach – e.g., **presenting needed information clearly for approvals** to make quick, informed decisions.
- **Scalability Best Practice:** Partition heavy jobs and use message queues; in cloud SaaS, leverage serverless or containers to auto-scale for high volume times.
- **Testing/UAT:** Before deployment, encourage clients to test the system with a variety of scenarios to ensure the workflows match their internal policies. Provide configuration adjustments as needed.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Capture metrics such as average approval time, exception rate, etc., and provide these to AP managers. They can use those to refine processes (maybe adjust thresholds or identify bottlenecks).

By following these best practices, the AP Automation solution will not only meet the specified requirements but also align with proven approaches to optimizing accounts payable, thereby delivering maximum value and compliance assurance to its users.

## 7. Glossary

Below is a glossary of terms and acronyms used in this PRD, for clarity:

- **AP (Accounts Payable):** The business function responsible for paying suppliers/vendors for goods and services received. Also refers to the amounts owed to suppliers.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** A software distribution model in which the application is hosted by a vendor or service provider (cloud-based) and made available to customers over the internet.
- **Workflow:** A sequence of processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion. In AP context, it includes steps like invoice receipt, approval, payment.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Technology to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents or PDFs, into editable and searchable data. Here used to extract text from invoice images.
- **PO (Purchase Order):** A commercial document issued by a buyer committing to pay the seller for the supply of specific products or services. In AP automation, invoices are often matched to POs.
- **3-Way Match:** A control process where the system matches the Invoice, Purchase Order, and Receiving Report before approving payment. Ensures consistency across these documents.
- **2-Way Match:** Matching just the Invoice and Purchase Order (used if no receiving document is applicable, or as a simpler control for services, etc.).
- **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning):** Integrated management software that often includes modules for purchasing, accounting, etc. (Examples: SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics). In our context, the ERP is the financial system that we integrate with for vendor data and posting invoices.
- **CPM (Corporate Performance Management):** Software for budgeting, forecasting, and other financial planning/analysis tasks (e.g., Hyperion, Anaplan). Needs data from AP for cash flow forecasting and performance analysis.
- **GL (General Ledger):** The main accounting ledger that records all financial transactions of an organization. Invoices eventually get recorded in the GL as expenses/liabilities.
- **GL Coding:** Assigning an invoice (or parts of it) to specific GL accounts (expense accounts, etc.) and possibly cost centers or departments.
- **Vendor (Supplier):** A company or individual that provides goods or services to the organization. The AP system pays vendors. "Vendor" and "Supplier" are used interchangeably.
- **Vendor Master:** The database (often in ERP) of all approved vendors with their details.
- **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange):** A standardized electronic format to exchange business documents. EDI 810 is the invoice format; if vendors use EDI, invoices can be ingested without OCR.
- **Approval Limit:** A monetary threshold up to which an individual is authorized to approve transactions. Beyond that, additional approval is required.
- **Segregation of Duties (SoD):** A fundamental internal control where no single individual has control over all phases of a transaction. In AP, typically the person who processes an invoice is different from the one who approves payment.
- **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act):** A U.S. law establishing broad auditing and financial regulations for public companies. Section 404 of SOX requires management and auditors to establish and report on the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting.
- **GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles):** Standard accounting rules and practices in the U.S. that companies must follow for financial reporting. Ensuring expenses and liabilities are recorded properly in AP is part of GAAP compliance.
- **Audit Trail:** A record that shows who has accessed a system and what operations the user has performed during a given period. Essential for forensic analysis and compliance.
- **Invoice Aging:** A report or metric showing how old unpaid invoices are (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, etc.). Helps manage overdue payments.
- **Duplicate Invoice:** Two invoices that are identical, often a result of the same invoice being sent or entered twice. AP automation must detect these to prevent double payment.
- **Exception (in AP):** Any invoice that cannot be processed straight-through (due to mismatch, missing info, etc.) and requires special attention or resolution.
- **Approval Workflow / Approval Chain:** The sequence of approvals required for a given invoice. Configured based on rules like amount or department.
- **Remittance (Advice):** Notification sent to a vendor to inform them of invoice payment (e.g., which invoices were paid in a batch and how).
- **Positive Pay:** A banking service that helps prevent fraud. Company tells the bank which check numbers and amounts they issued; bank only honors those. Mentioned in context of check process control.
- **ACH (Automated Clearing House):** An electronic network for financial transactions, commonly used in the US for direct deposit and vendor payments (electronic fund transfer).
- **KPI (Key Performance Indicator):** Metrics to measure performance. In AP, KPIs could be average processing time per invoice, number of invoices per AP clerk per day, rate of exceptions, etc.
- **UAT (User Acceptance Testing):** A testing phase where actual users validate the system meets their needs, often the final step before go-live.
