# B2B SaaS Subscription Management Platform – Software Requirements Specification

## Executive Summary

With the rise of the subscription economy, businesses require a robust platform to manage recurring revenue streams and customer subscriptions. SaaS adoption continues to accelerate – the global subscription and billing management market is forecast to grow from **\$4.0 billion in 2020 to \$7.8 billion by 2025**, driven by an increase in subscription business models, the need to improve customer retention (reduce churn), and compliance with evolving regulations. A **B2B SaaS Subscription Management Platform** is essential for capitalizing on this trend, enabling companies to automate billing at predetermined intervals and oversee all interactions throughout the customer subscription lifecycle – from the moment a prospect becomes a subscriber until cancellation.

This document serves as a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for such a platform, intended for product managers and stakeholders. It outlines the platform’s scope, objectives, and detailed requirements – including functional capabilities, UI/UX considerations, system architecture, data management, integration points, and compliance (e.g. GDPR). In summary, the platform will allow businesses to **define flexible subscription plans**, **manage pricing (including discounts and promotions)**, **handle the full subscription lifecycle** (renewals, upgrades, downgrades, pauses, cancellations), **identify upsell and cross-sell opportunities**, and **securely manage customer data and payments**. Emphasis is placed on delivering an intuitive user interface (for both administrators and customers) and ensuring high performance, security, and scalability. Subsequent sections in this document provide a detailed blueprint of the platform’s features and design, ensuring that development can proceed with clarity and alignment to business goals.

## Product Scope and Objectives

### Scope

This platform will provide end-to-end subscription management capabilities for B2B SaaS companies, covering the following in-scope features:

* **Subscription Plan Management:** Define and manage subscription plans for a variety of offerings – including software services, digital content subscriptions, and physical product subscriptions. Administrators can create plans with different tiers, billing cycles, and included features for each product or service line.
* **Pricing and Promotions:** Manage pricing for subscription packages, including setting base prices, multi-currency pricing, and configuring promotional deals (discounts, coupons, free trials, introductory rates, etc.). The system supports time-limited offers and special pricing rules to attract or retain customers.
* **Custom Plans and Bundles:** Allow the creation of custom subscription plans for specific clients (e.g. tailored enterprise deals) and bundled offerings that combine multiple products/services into one subscription package. Multi-year contract arrangements (e.g. 2–5 year commitments) are supported, including handling of term discounts and contract-specific terms.
* **Subscription Lifecycle Management:** Oversee the entire lifecycle of each subscription. This includes automated renewals, upgrade/downgrade processes, mid-cycle plan changes, pauses (temporary suspensions), reactivations, and cancellations (with optional customer retention flows).
* **Sales Opportunity Management:** Identify and manage upselling and cross-selling opportunities within the existing customer base. The platform will provide insights or flags when an account might be ready for an upgrade or an additional product, helping sales teams increase customer value.
* **Customer and Account Management:** Store and organize customer information, including company details, contacts, contract terms, account preferences, and full billing history. Sensitive personal and payment data will be stored securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.
* **Billing and Payments:** Handle recurring billing and payments, both automatic and manual. The system will integrate with multiple payment methods – credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and digital wallets (e.g. PayPal) – and accommodate various billing frequencies (monthly, quarterly, annual, multi-year). It will generate invoices, collect payments, and track transaction statuses.
* **Analytics and Reporting:** Track key sales and revenue metrics for subscription products (e.g. MRR, churn rate, LTV) and provide reporting and dashboards for business insights. Users can access both predefined reports and custom analytics to monitor the health and growth of the subscription business.

**Out of Scope:** The platform is focused on subscription management and does **not** aim to replace full CRM or ERP systems. General lead management, support ticketing, and product usage monitoring are out of scope (though integrations will be available to link to such systems). Similarly, for physical product subscriptions, the platform will record subscription details and schedule, but **will not handle warehousing or shipping logistics** – those functions would be managed by an external fulfillment system. Development of a proprietary payment processing gateway is out of scope; instead, the platform will integrate with existing payment gateways and tax calculation services. Any content delivery or product-specific functionalities (e.g. software license enforcement, content streaming) are handled by the product itself, not by the subscription platform, which concerns itself with the commercial and billing aspects.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of the Subscription Management Platform are to:

* **Provide a Unified Solution:** Deliver a single platform for businesses to manage all subscription-related activities, eliminating the need for disparate tools or manual processes. This includes one interface to handle plan configuration, customer accounts, billing, and analytics.
* **Increase Operational Efficiency:** **Automate recurring processes** (such as invoicing, payment collection, and renewals) to reduce manual effort and human error in managing subscriptions. By taking the drudgery out of invoice tracking and payment handling, the platform frees up teams to focus on higher-value tasks.
* **Enhance Flexibility in Offerings:** Enable businesses to quickly create or modify subscription offerings (new plans, pricing changes, promotional campaigns) in response to market demands. The platform should accommodate a wide range of pricing models and subscription structures without custom development for each scenario.
* **Improve Revenue Growth and Retention:** Provide tools to maximize customer lifetime value. This includes identifying upsell/cross-sell opportunities and supporting **customer retention strategies** (such as offering alternative plans or discounts when a customer attempts to cancel). Deepening existing customer relationships is far more cost-effective than acquiring new customers, so the platform will help companies grow revenue by **upselling (offering higher-tier packages) and cross-selling (additional related products) to current clients**.
* **Offer Superior Customer Experience:** Ensure the platform contributes to end-customer satisfaction. Subscriptions should be easy to manage, with transparent pricing, timely communications (e.g. renewal reminders), and self-service options for customers to manage their own subscriptions. A smoother experience leads to higher customer retention and loyalty.
* **Ensure Security and Compliance:** **Safeguard customer data and privacy** by design. The platform will enforce strong security measures (encryption, access controls, etc.) and include features to help the business comply with regulations like GDPR for personal data and PCI DSS for payment data. Compliance is non-negotiable both to avoid legal penalties and to maintain customer trust.
* **Scalability and Reliability:** Design the system to scale with a business’s growth. Whether the client has 100 subscriptions or 100,000+, the platform should perform reliably and with high availability. This includes architectural support for multi-tenant use (serving multiple businesses or divisions securely from one platform instance) and robust performance during peak billing periods.
* **Integrability:** Allow the platform to fit into the company’s broader IT ecosystem. It should integrate with CRM, ERP, accounting systems, and other tools to ensure **transparency across the quote-to-cash process**. Open APIs and webhooks will enable custom integrations and extension of the platform’s capabilities.
* **Maintainability and Extensibility:** Provide a solution that is maintainable over time – it should be easy to update with new features, fix issues, and adapt to new requirements (such as emerging payment methods or regulatory changes). Clear documentation and a modular design will support ongoing improvements.

By meeting these objectives, the platform will help businesses streamline their subscription operations, reduce revenue leakage, and enhance their agility in the subscription economy. Ultimately, success will be measured by improved key metrics for the business (higher recurring revenue, lower churn) and positive feedback from internal users (e.g. product managers, finance teams) and customers who interact with the subscription system.

## Functional Requirements

This section details the functional capabilities of the platform. The requirements are organized around core areas of functionality corresponding to the platform’s key features.

### Subscription Plan Definition & Management

The platform shall provide robust capabilities to define, configure, and manage **subscription plans** for various product types (software services, digital goods, or physical product subscriptions). Administrators (product managers or billing admins) can create and modify plans through an intuitive interface, with the system enforcing consistency and version control of plan data.

* **Plan Creation:** Authorized users can create new subscription plans by specifying details such as plan name, description, associated product or service, and the billing parameters. Each plan is associated with a specific product or offering (e.g., “Software Suite A – Basic Plan” vs. “Monthly Snack Box Subscription”) so that multiple offerings can be managed in one system. Plans can be grouped by product line or category for organization.
* **Plan Attributes:** For each plan, the system shall capture key attributes:

  * **Billing Frequency:** Supported billing intervals include monthly, quarterly, annual, or custom multi-year terms. The plan can have one or multiple billing options (e.g., monthly vs. yearly pricing) as separate variants.
  * **Pricing Details:** The base price (recurring fee) for the plan, defined per billing cycle (e.g. \$100 per month). If multi-currency support is enabled, the plan can have different prices per currency or use exchange rates for conversion.
  * **Included Features/Entitlements:** A description or list of features included in the plan (for software/digital services) or the contents for a physical subscription. The platform should allow linking “features” or limits to plans (for example, number of users allowed, storage quota, support level). Each plan’s feature set is clearly delineated.
  * **Product Type Specifics:** If the plan is for a physical product subscription, it may include attributes like shipment frequency (e.g. ships monthly) and perhaps inventory SKUs for the items included. (Integration with inventory systems is out of scope, but the plan can reference a product code for fulfillment systems to use.)
  * **Status and Availability:** Plans have an **“active/inactive” status** flag to indicate if they are currently sold or retired. Inactive plans are preserved for reference (especially if existing subscribers are grandfathered on them) but cannot be sold to new customers. Administrators can schedule a plan to become active or inactive on certain dates (allowing, for example, future plan launches or limited-time offerings).
  * **Plan Constraints:** The platform shall enforce any constraints such as mutually exclusive features or pre-requisites. For example, if certain plans are only available to specific customer types or regions, the system should record that (and the UI should prevent selection if criteria aren’t met).
* **Multiple Plan Tiers:** The system will support **tiered offerings** for each product. For example, a software product might have “Basic”, “Pro”, and “Enterprise” plans with increasing levels of features. Plans can be related in a hierarchy or tagged by tier level to facilitate upgrade/downgrade logic. The platform should allow definition of **several distinct plans per product (each with different options)**, such as a premium plan that includes all features vs. a basic plan with essentials.
* **Plan Versioning and Updates:** Administrators can update plan details, but the system must preserve historical information. If a price or feature is changed on a plan:

  * New customers should get the updated terms, while existing subscribers typically retain their original terms unless explicitly migrated.
  * The platform might implement this by **versioning plans** or by recording effective date ranges for plan attributes. (For example, Plan A price was \$100 until Dec 2025, and \$110 starting Jan 2026.)
  * Changes to active subscriptions due to plan updates will be handled through upgrade processes (see Lifecycle Management), not silently applied, unless it’s a global change that is forced (such scenarios should prompt an admin warning/confirmation).
* **Custom Fields and Metadata:** The platform should allow storing custom metadata for plans (e.g., an internal SKU code, accounting code for revenue recognition, or marketing campaign tags). This helps integrate with other systems (like ERP) and track plans internally.
* **Visibility Control:** In cases where the platform includes a customer-facing plan selection (e.g., if it feeds a signup page or is used by sales teams), it should mark which plans are publicly available vs. internal. Some plans might be hidden (used only for custom deals).
* **Bundled Plans:** The system shall support creating **bundle offerings** as special plans. A bundle plan may include multiple products or subscriptions under one price. For instance, an “All-Access Bundle” could give the customer access to *multiple software products* or *multiple subscription items* for a single combined price.

  * Implementation-wise, an admin might create a bundle plan that automatically provisions several component subscriptions (or entitlements) when purchased. The system should link the bundle to its components so that metrics can be tracked individually if needed.
  * Even when sold as a bundle, it should be possible to manage or cancel components separately if the business model requires it. (For example, if a customer wants to drop one component of the bundle but keep others, the business may handle that by transitioning them to different plans.) **Note:** The platform will maintain separate subscription records for each component under the hood even if sold together, allowing independent management, but present it as a unified bundle to the customer/admin for convenience.
* **Dependency on Inventory (Physical Products):** Although the platform is not responsible for inventory management, it should allow capturing information needed for fulfillment of physical subscriptions (e.g., size/variant selections, start date for first shipment). These details will be accessible via API for integration with fulfillment systems. (For example, if a customer subscribes to a monthly coffee box, the plan might record “delivers 2 bags of coffee/month” and the start date so the shipping system knows when to send the first box.)
* **Plan Retirement:** Admins can retire a plan from use. Retirement means no new subscriptions can be started on that plan. Existing subscribers either continue on that plan (if allowed) or need to be migrated. The platform should assist in migrating subscribers in bulk if a plan is being sunset (for example, selecting a replacement plan and moving all subscribers). Audit logs should record such migrations for compliance.
* **Plan Cloning:** To aid rapid creation, the UI should allow cloning an existing plan as a template, then modifying fields. This is useful when setting up similar plans (e.g., a new year’s pricing with slight changes).
* **Plan API:** All plan management capabilities shall be available via API as well (detailed in APIs section), allowing external systems or automated scripts to create/update plans if needed (with appropriate authentication and authorization).

By fulfilling these requirements, the platform will offer a flexible **catalog management** capability for subscription plans. Businesses can easily configure their subscription offerings – from simple monthly plans to complex bundles – and adjust them over time, all while maintaining data integrity and a history of changes.

### Pricing Management and Promotions

A core feature of the platform is the ability to manage complex pricing schemes and promotional offers. Pricing management covers setting base prices, defining discounts, and handling any adjustments to charges over the subscription’s life. The platform must support a high degree of flexibility in pricing rules to accommodate marketing campaigns and customer-specific deals.

* **Flexible Pricing Models:** The system should support a variety of pricing models for subscriptions, such as flat recurring fees, tiered pricing based on usage/quantity (if applicable to the service), and volume or bulk pricing (e.g. discount per user as user count increases). At a basic level, the platform needs to allow offering different subscription options, pricing models, promotions, discounts, free trials, etc., with easy configuration of **pricing tiers, upgrades/downgrades, packages, and bundles**.
* **Recurring Charge Setup:** For each plan, define the recurring charge amount for each billing cycle. If a plan has multiple billing frequency options (say monthly vs yearly), the yearly option might have a discounted rate (e.g., “\$100/month or \$1,080/year”). The platform should handle these as either separate plan variants or a pricing option under a single plan with proration logic.
* **One-Time Fees:** Allow associating one-time charges with a subscription sign-up (for example, a setup fee or an initiation fee that is charged once at the start). The platform should add this to the first invoice if applicable. Similarly, allow one-time charges later (e.g., a hardware purchase added to a subscription) – though these might be entered manually by an admin as an ad-hoc invoice line item.
* **Promotional Discounts:** Administrators can create **promotional offers** and discounts. These promotions may be applied to subscriptions to reduce the price under certain conditions:

  * **Coupon Codes:** Support generation of coupon codes that customers can redeem (e.g., a code for 20% off the first 3 months). The system should allow specifying coupon parameters: percentage discount or fixed amount, whether it applies one-time or to each billing cycle, applicable plans or products, expiration date of the coupon, and usage limits (single-use per customer, total uses allowed, etc.).
  * **Automatic Promotions:** The platform should also handle promotions that don’t require a code, such as seasonal sales that automatically apply a discount for all new sign-ups during a period.
  * **Discount Configuration:** Promotions should be definable with **either a fixed amount off or a percentage off**, and the platform will clearly record the type of discount and its value. It will also record the **duration** of the discount – e.g., “10% off for first 6 months” or “\$50 off the first payment only.”
  * **Promotional Period:** Offers have a validity period (start and end date) during which they can be granted. After the offer end date, it should no longer apply to new subscriptions. The system stores the offer’s time window and ensures it’s only applied within that window.
  * **Applicability:** The system allows tying offers to specific subscription plans or customer segments. For example, a promotion might be valid only for the “Pro Plan” or only for non-profit customers. This means when creating an offer, admin can specify filters or rules for what subscriptions qualify.
  * **Stacking Rules:** By default, prevent multiple promotions from stacking on the same subscription unless explicitly allowed. (E.g., if one promotion is already applied, another coupon may be rejected or queued to apply later once the first expires.)
* **Free Trials:** Natively support free trial periods as a form of promotion. A free trial means the subscription begins with a certain period (e.g., 30 days) with no charge, after which regular billing starts. The plan configuration or promotion can specify a trial duration. The platform must handle trial periods by:

  * Not billing the customer during the trial.
  * Auto-converting the subscription to paid status at trial end (charging the payment method on file) if the customer has not canceled. A flag like `subscribe_after_trial` indicates if it will auto-convert when the trial ends.
  * Sending notifications prior to trial expiration (covered in the UI/Notifications requirements).
  * Ensuring trial eligibility rules (e.g., one trial per customer).
* **Introductory Pricing:** Similar to free trials, support introductory pricing schemes. For example, “first 3 months for \$10, then \$30 thereafter.” The system could implement this as a promotion that applies a certain discount for the first 3 cycles. It needs to automatically adjust the price after the promo period ends. Each subscription record should retain info on any introductory rate and when it steps up to normal price.
* **Multi-Year Contract Discounts:** When multi-year subscriptions are sold (see custom contracts section), allow setting up pricing that changes per year or provides an overall discount. For instance, **a 3-year contract might have:** Year 1 at standard price, Year 2 at 5% discount, Year 3 at 10% discount as an incentive. The system should be able to schedule these price changes or compute the appropriate discount for the contract as a whole. Multi-year deals usually come with such **volume or term discounts in return for commitment**. This could be configured as a special offer that spans the length of the contract.
* **Geographical Pricing & Tax:** The platform should allow price variations by region if needed (e.g., different price in Europe vs US for the same service), though often this is handled via separate plans or currency conversion. In conjunction with tax integration (see below), the system will **display prices either inclusive or exclusive of taxes** based on locale rules. Tax handling itself (calculating VAT/GST) will be done via integration with tax engines, but the pricing engine must pass the correct data to the tax engine. The **software should provide automatic tax handling** by sending relevant fields to an external tax engine to compute sales tax/VAT/GST, ensuring compliance with global and local tax requirements. (This is more of a non-functional compliance requirement but impacts invoice calculations functionally.)
* **Proration of Charges:** If a customer changes their subscription plan or term mid-cycle (upgrade or downgrade), the system must **prorate charges appropriately**. Proration is the mechanism to charge (or credit) only for the partial period the customer used on each plan. The platform will:

  * Calculate any additional amount due when upgrading (for example, if upgrading halfway through the month to a more expensive plan, charge a prorated amount for the remaining half of the month on the new plan).
  * Calculate any credit or adjustment when downgrading or pausing (e.g., if the customer already paid for the full month on a higher plan and switches to a lower plan, the difference for the unused period should either be credited or applied to future invoices).
  * Ensure proration is fair and transparent, following standard practices (e.g., based on the number of days remaining in the billing cycle) to avoid billing “distortions” when adjustments occur mid-period.
  * This proration logic will be consistent with what billing industry standards recommend for upgrades/downgrades in subscriptions.
* **Rounding and Precision:** The pricing engine must handle currency rounding rules consistently. For example, if proration results in fractional cents, define a rule (round half up to nearest cent, etc.) to ensure totals make sense on invoices. Support at least two decimal places for currencies (and more for certain currencies like JPY that have no decimals, or cryptocurrencies if ever needed).
* **Time-Limited Promotions and Renewals:** The system should automatically **expire promotional pricing** when its term is complete. For instance, if a customer had 6 months at a discounted rate, on month 7 the system reverts to standard pricing without needing manual intervention. The subscription record should carry information about the promo and its end date so that normal billing resumes afterwards. Conversely, if a promotion is “lifetime” (e.g., 10% off for the life of subscription), it never expires for that subscription once applied.
* **Customer-Specific Pricing:** Support creating special pricing for an individual customer (this ties into custom plans/contracts). An admin should be able to override the price for a particular subscription record if they have appropriate permission – for example, setting a custom negotiated rate that is not one of the standard plan prices. The system will then use that override for billing that customer. This effectively creates a custom plan instance for the customer. All such overrides should be documented (with reason/notes) and audited.
* **Pricing API:** All pricing rules and promotions should be reflected via API for use in external storefronts or quoting tools. For example, an API endpoint to fetch current price for a given plan (and possibly apply a coupon code to see resulting price) will help if the business’s website wants to show pricing dynamically. This ensures consistency between what is advertised and what is charged.
* **Invoice Generation:** *(closely related to payments but included here for pricing context)* – The platform should automatically generate an **invoice record for each billing cycle** or event (like signup fee). Each invoice calculates line items: subscription charges, discounts applied, taxes, and the resulting total. Invoices should reflect the pricing rules accurately (e.g., show original price and discount as separate line or combined net amount). The system should support **configurable invoice templates** and consolidation options – for example, **consolidating charges for multiple subscriptions of one customer into one invoice**, or separating them by subscription, based on business preference. (This is especially relevant if one enterprise customer has many subscriptions; they may want one combined bill.)
* **Examples:** To illustrate:

  * *Promotion Example:* An admin sets up an offer “BLACKFRIDAY2025” which gives **25% off the first year** of any annual plan, available only for new customers who sign up in Nov 2025. The system should allow entering: Discount = 25% off, Duration = 1 year (or first payment of annual plan), Eligibility = new customers, Valid period = 2025-11-01 to 2025-11-30. A customer subscribing on November 15, 2025 to a \$1200/year plan would be charged \$900 for the first year (25% off \$1200) and then \$1200/year subsequently.
  * *Bundle Pricing Example:* A bundle plan “Premium Suite” includes Product A and Product B together for \$200/month, whereas separately they cost \$120 and \$100 (total \$220). The platform sets up “Premium Suite” as a plan with base price \$200. When a customer subscribes to it, it creates two linked subscription records under the hood (one for A, one for B) for service delivery, but billing is only \$200 on one invoice. If later the price of Product A or B changes, it doesn’t automatically change the bundle’s price – that would be a separate decision by the business (the admin would update the bundle price manually if needed).
  * *Custom Price Example:* Customer X negotiates a special rate of \$90/month for the Pro Plan (normally \$100/month). An admin uses a “custom price” override on Customer X’s subscription, so invoices for that subscription use \$90. The system might implement this by creating a hidden promotion of \$10 off perpetually for that subscription or by attaching a special rate attribute to the subscription.

In summary, the platform’s pricing engine will **complement the flexibility of plan management** by allowing virtually any pricing scheme: standard recurring fees, promotional discounts of various forms, and per-customer customizations. **It will automate the application and expiration of promotions** so that revenue recognition is accurate with minimal manual intervention. By handling proration and complex scenarios, it ensures customers are billed fairly only for what they use, which increases trust and satisfaction.

### Custom Plans, Bundles, and Multi‑Year Contracts

Many B2B scenarios require flexibility beyond out-of-the-box plans – such as custom-negotiated plans for enterprise clients, packaging multiple products, or locking in multi-year subscription agreements. The platform shall support these needs through features for custom plans, bundling, and contract management.

* **Custom Subscription Plans (Customer-Specific Plans):** The platform will allow creating a subscription with terms unique to a single customer when none of the standard plans apply directly. This can be achieved in a couple of ways:

  * **Custom Plan Definition:** Admins can create a new plan in the system that is marked as a **“custom plan” for a specific customer** (or a group of customers). For example, an enterprise customer might require a mix of features from different plans plus a specific price. The admin could clone a similar plan, adjust features/pricing, and label it for that customer only. The plan could be hidden from the general catalog (not visible to other customers).
  * **Inline Customization on Subscription:** Alternatively, the system can allow overriding certain parameters directly on a subscription record (as mentioned in pricing). For instance, taking an existing plan as baseline and adjusting the price or adding an extra feature for that customer’s subscription only. This avoids cluttering the plan catalog with one-off plans. The subscription record would then carry custom terms.
  * **Documentation and Audit:** In either case, the platform should require documentation of what was changed for a custom plan (e.g., a notes field describing the special agreement). All customizations should be auditable – e.g., who approved a custom price. This is important for governance and later reference when renewing or changing that subscription.
  * **Renewal of Custom Plans:** If a custom plan has a set term, the system should treat its renewal in a controlled way. Perhaps it doesn’t auto-renew without review, or if it does, it continues at the custom terms unless renegotiated. The platform should signal when a custom subscription term is nearing end so account managers can review if new terms are needed.
* **Bundled Offerings:** The platform will support selling **bundles** of multiple subscriptions/products as a single package (as introduced in the plan management section). Key requirements for bundles:

  * **Single Subscription View:** A bundle can be presented as a single subscription entry to the admin and customer, with one aggregate price. This improves simplicity on billing (one invoice line) and management (one renewal date).
  * **Multiple Components:** Behind the scenes, the bundle comprises multiple components (which could be other plans). The system should establish links such that when a bundle is purchased, the customer gains all component subscriptions.
  * **Lifecycle Sync:** Actions on the bundle at the top level should propagate appropriately. E.g., canceling the bundle will cancel all component subscriptions. Pausing the bundle pauses all components. However, upgrading/downgrading might be restricted (one might upgrade the whole bundle to another bundle, but not components individually if they are only sold as part of bundle).
  * **Component Management:** In some cases, the business might allow modifications within a bundle (like swapping one product for another in a customizable bundle). The platform should support such changes by treating components individually when needed. Each component is actually a normal subscription entry linked by an Offer/Bundle ID. This design allows the flexibility to **cancel or modify components separately** if business rules permit. For example, if a customer in a bundle decides they no longer want product B, the company could remove that component and perhaps adjust the price (effectively creating a new custom plan for them).
  * **Partial Bundle Changes:** The platform should carefully handle partial changes – ensuring any pricing adjustments are made and communicated. Possibly easiest is to cancel the old bundle and create a new arrangement (with proration for mid-cycle changes).
  * **Metrics for Bundles:** The reporting should account for bundles properly – for instance, not double-count revenue (the bundle’s price is the actual revenue, not the sum of internal components since that would duplicate). Metrics like subscription count might count a bundle as 1 (for customer-level count) but also may count component subscriptions for product-level metrics. The data model must link these for flexible reporting.
* **Multi-Year Contract Support:** Many B2B deals involve committing a customer to a **multi-year contract** for their subscription, often in exchange for better pricing or terms. The platform will include features to manage these contracts:

  * **Contract Term Length:** When creating a subscription, the admin can specify a contract term (in years or months beyond a single billing period). For example, *36 months (3 years)*. This could be tied to a special multi-year plan or configured as an attribute on the subscription.
  * **No Annual Renegotiation:** A multi-year contract means the price and terms are locked in for the duration without annual renewal negotiation. The system should reflect that by automatically renewing the subscription through the term without requiring manual renewal each year. The **agreement spans multiple years continuously**.
  * **Billing Schedule for Multi-Year:** Even if the contract is multi-year, billing might still occur annually or monthly. The system should support:

    * Billing the entire multi-year term upfront (one invoice for the full term) – less common but possible for some deals.
    * Annual or other periodic billing within the contract term – e.g., a 3-year contract that is billed yearly. In this case, the system auto-renews the subscription at year 2 and 3 at the agreed price, but it knows not to treat these as new negotiations or allow cancellation without penalty in between (because the customer is committed).
    * If billing is periodic, ensure the price for each period is according to contract (which could be a fixed price each period or escalating, etc., as set in the contract).
  * **Contractual Discounts/Incentives:** Typically multi-year deals include incentives like **discounts or added value** in exchange for the commitment. The platform should allow setting a **contract-level discount** (e.g., 10% off standard price for committing to 3 years). This can be implemented via a promotion that spans the contract length or a custom plan price. The key is that the discount should not drop off until the contract term is complete. Alternatively, the contract might fix a price to protect against rate increases.
  * **Price Escalations:** Some contracts might stipulate price increases in later years (for example, *Year 1 at \$X, Year 2 at \$X+5%, Year 3 at \$X+10%*). The platform should allow scheduling these changes. This could be handled by creating an offer that changes the discount rate over time or by setting different plan versions effective on certain dates within the subscription. The data model might record a schedule of prices for the subscription. At minimum, an admin could schedule a price change on that subscription effective on a future date (the system should support future-dated changes to subscriptions).
  * **Contract Record Keeping:** There should be a notion of a **“Contract”** entity or attributes (like contract start date, end date, and maybe a reference ID to a contract document). This helps in management and reporting – e.g., listing all contracts ending this quarter for renewal pipeline. The platform might store the signed contract document as an attachment in the customer’s account or provide a reference link (though document storage may be minimal, linking to CRM or contract management system).
  * **Mid-Term Cancellation Rules:** If a customer is in a multi-year contract, cancellation before the term ends may incur penalties or is disallowed per contract. The system should flag if a user tries to cancel such a subscription early. It could require an admin override and record a “contract terminated early” status. (Penalties might be managed offline by finance, but the system could note if any remaining balance is due.)
  * **Renewal of Contracts:** As a multi-year term approaches its end, the platform should:

    * Notify relevant users (account managers) well in advance (e.g., 90 days before end) so they can work on renewal or extension.
    * If the contract has an auto-renew clause, handle renewing for another term possibly at updated terms. (Perhaps duplicating the subscription record for a new term or extending dates.)
    * Allow renegotiation – which practically might mean setting up a new contract (new subscription plan) replacing the old one at end of term. The system should ensure a smooth transition so that service is not interrupted between contract periods.
* **Unified Management of Deals:** In the admin UI, it should be easy to see which subscriptions are **custom deals, bundled, or under multi-year contracts**. For instance, labels or badges can indicate “Custom”, “Bundle”, “Contract – ends Dec 2026”. This helps administrators manage these special cases proactively.
* **Opportunities and Approvals:** The platform might integrate with a sales pipeline (via integration or simple internal tracking) to handle custom deal approvals. For example, if sales reps propose a custom price or bundle, maybe the system can enforce a workflow where a higher-level approval is required before it becomes active. This ensures governance on non-standard deals. (This could be a future/optional feature – at minimum, document and audit who set up the custom terms.)
* **Examples:**

  * *Multi-Year Contract:* A customer signs a **3-year subscription contract** for a software service. Standard price is \$1,000/month, but for 3 years the vendor offers 10% off, making it \$900/month. In the platform, the admin creates a 36-month subscription for the customer, sets the billing cycle to monthly, base price \$1,000 with a contract-level 10% discount applied throughout. The **subscription start date is Jan 1, 2025 and end date Dec 31, 2027**. The system will generate monthly invoices of \$900 for the duration. The subscription record shows it’s under contract until end date, and the customer cannot be set to cancel before that in the UI without override. At the end of 2027, the system alerts the account manager; if renewed, the admin might extend the subscription (or create a new one) with new terms. During the 3 years, if the customer attempts to reduce usage or change plan, the account manager knows they are locked in; if the vendor allows a downgrade mid-term, it might involve re-negotiating the contract and adjusting the record in the system manually.
  * *Custom Bundle for Enterprise:* An enterprise client wants a bundle of 3 products with 100 user licenses each, plus a dedicated support rep, all under one subscription for a flat annual fee. The vendor doesn’t have this as a public plan. The admin uses the platform to create a “Enterprise Suite – Custom for ClientX” plan: marks it as a bundle of Product1+Product2+Product3, 100 users each, and perhaps notes the support service. Sets an annual price (e.g. \$50,000/year). Marks the plan as custom and only available for ClientX. When ClientX subscribes, the system creates three component subscriptions (each product) with 100 users allocation, and one support service entitlement, but billing is done under the single \$50K invoice. All components share the same term and renewal date. The customer sees one subscription “Enterprise Suite” in their portal. Internally, the success team can still see that it includes the three products to ensure provisioning is correct.

Overall, these capabilities ensure that the platform can handle **non-standard sales arrangements**, which are very common in B2B contexts. Whether it’s giving a specific client a tailored plan or selling complex bundles and long-term deals, the platform will manage the complexity in the backend while presenting clear and unified information to users.

### Sales and Revenue Metrics Tracking

Tracking sales and revenue metrics is a critical functional aspect that enables businesses to gauge the performance of their subscription offerings. The platform shall automatically collect key metrics and make them accessible through dashboards and reports. (Detailed reporting and analytics features are described in a later section, but here we outline what core metrics and tracking capabilities are expected.)

* **Active Subscription Count:** The system will maintain a count of active subscriptions at any given time, broken down by plan, product, customer segment, etc. An “active subscription” is one that is not canceled or expired as of the date in question (including those in trial or paused status possibly flagged separately).
* **New Subscriptions:** Track the number of **new subscriptions started** in a given period (day, week, month). A “New Subscription” is typically counted when a subscription moves from prospect/trial to active, or when a new customer starts paying. The platform should timestamp the start of each subscription to support this. For example, a dashboard might show “New Subscriptions This Month: 50”.
* **Cancellations & Churn:** Track the number of **subscriptions canceled** in a given period and compute **churn rate**. Churn can be measured in two ways:

  * **Logo Churn (Customer Churn):** The percentage of subscribers who cancel in a period relative to the starting subscriber count.
  * **Revenue Churn:** The amount of recurring revenue lost due to cancellations (or downgrades) in a period.
    The platform will mark when a subscription is canceled and its effective end date, enabling churn calculations. It should allow input of cancellation reason codes (so churn can be analyzed by reason).
* **Upgrades/Downgrades:** Track subscription upgrades and downgrades as distinct events. For upgrades, the system can calculate **expansion MRR** (Monthly Recurring Revenue added from existing customers upgrading). For downgrades, calculate **contraction MRR** (revenue lost from downsizing). The net of these gives **net revenue retention** figures.
* **Reactivations:** Count reactivations of previously churned subscriptions. For example, if a customer canceled and then returned (either restarting their old subscription or signing a new one within some window), mark that as a reactivation. This metric indicates win-back success (e.g., “Reactivations this quarter: 5”).
* **MRR/ARR:** Compute **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** and **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**. MRR is typically the sum of all subscription’s monthly fees normalized to a monthly rate. (If a subscription is billed annually for \$1200, its normalized MRR is \$100.) ARR is 12 \* MRR or directly sum of annualized subscription values. The platform should dynamically update MRR/ARR as subscriptions are added, changed, or removed. On a dashboard, the **current MRR** and its trend over time should be displayed (e.g., a chart showing MRR growth month by month).
* **Revenue and Collections:** Track actual revenue collected in each period from subscriptions (which may differ from MRR due to billing frequencies, one-time charges, etc.). This is more of an accounting metric but the system will have invoice/payment data to calculate **total recurring revenue**, **one-time revenue**, and **total revenue** for any timeframe. It can break this down by product, region, etc.
* **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User):** Or per customer – calculate by dividing total recurring revenue by number of active customers. This metric can be helpful to see if upsells are increasing the value of each customer.
* **Lifetime Value (LTV):** While a bit more complex (requires an assumed churn rate and maybe margin), the platform can assist by providing the data needed to calculate LTV per customer. Possibly it can calculate retrospectively actual total revenue per customer to date, and track how that grows.
* **Customer Tenure & Cohorts:** Track how long subscribers stay subscribed (for churn analysis). The system knows each subscription’s start and end; it can produce metrics like average subscription duration, or cohort-based retention rates (e.g., “out of customers who joined in 2024 Q1, 80% are still active after 12 months”). Some of these advanced analytics might be delivered via the reporting module using raw data.
* **Segmented Metrics:** All metrics should be filterable by various dimensions:

  * By product or plan (e.g., MRR per product line, number of subscriptions per plan).
  * By customer attributes (region, industry if provided, size of customer).
  * By subscription status (trial vs paid, month-to-month vs multi-year contracts, etc.).
  * Time-based cohorts (as mentioned).
* **Sales Pipeline Metrics (Optional/Integration):** If integrated with a CRM or if the platform manages trial conversions, it could track conversion rates (trial -> paid), and upcoming renewals or expansions as a “pipeline.” However, core focus is on actual subscription metrics rather than prospective sales. Integration with CRM could bring forecast info.
* **Upsell/Cross-sell Identification:** The platform will include some metrics or indicators to identify **sales opportunities**:

  * For example, a report of customers on outdated plans or lower-tier plans who might be good candidates for an upgrade (like those who frequently hit usage limits or have high engagement).
  * Or customers who have one product but not another (e.g., “20 customers use Product A but not Product B”), which is effectively a cross-sell target list.
  * While the intelligence behind identifying opportunities can be manual, the system provides the data: usage stats if available, subscription combinations, etc., to help sales teams formulate upsell strategies.
* **Financial Metrics for Accounting:** (Though not the primary analytics focus, it’s worth noting) The system should provide data for **Deferred Revenue** (if a customer pays upfront for a year, the platform knows how much is “earned” vs deferred at any point). It could also track **billings vs revenue**. These data points ensure the finance team can get what they need for revenue recognition standards (ASC 606/IFRS 15 compliance, possibly via integration).
* **Visualization and Dashboard:** A real-time **analytics dashboard** will present key metrics at a glance. For example, an **“Analytics” or “Overview” dashboard** might show:

  * New Subscriptions this period, New Trials started, Reactivations.
  * Current MRR and a chart of MRR over the last 12 months.
  * Net revenue growth (with components like +X from upgrades, –Y from churn).
  * A “History” activity log listing recent significant events (e.g., major upgrades, cancellations).
  * Pie or bar charts for distribution (e.g., revenue by plan, percentage of customers on each plan).
  * Customer engagement stats if available (like login frequency if integrated – more of a product metric, but could show active usage).
  * The dashboard should allow some customization or filter (e.g., view metrics for a particular product line).
* **Data Freshness:** Metrics like MRR, counts, etc., should update promptly as transactions occur. Ideally in real-time or near real-time for dashboard display. If real-time computation is heavy, the system can update these on a periodic job (say nightly for complex metrics), but things like a new sale should reflect quickly (possibly the dashboard pulls live from the database).
* **Export and API:** All metrics and underlying data should be available for export or via API, so that finance or analytics teams can plug into external BI tools if desired. This means the system should expose endpoints or reports for raw subscription data and allow scheduled exports (CSV, etc.) of key metrics.

By automatically tracking these metrics, the platform becomes not just a transactional system but also an **intelligence hub** for the subscription business. Users can rely on it to answer questions like “How are we doing this month?” and “Which products are driving growth?” without manual calculations. For example, a built-in analytics dashboard might showcase **key performance indicators like new subscriptions, active subscriptions, monthly recurring revenue, and churn at a glance**, along with visualizations for trends and historical comparisons. Having this data readily available enables proactive management – if churn spikes or MRR dips, the team will know immediately and can investigate why (perhaps by drilling into cancellation reasons or product-specific performance).

*(The specific reporting and analytics features, including customizable reports and visual dashboard elements, are further detailed in the “Reporting and Analytics” section of this document. This current section ensures the system is functionally tracking and storing the necessary data points to produce those analytics.)*

### Subscription Lifecycle Management (Renewals, Changes, Cancellation)

Managing the lifecycle of a subscription is a central function of the platform. This includes actions and state changes that occur from the subscription’s start through its active life, and eventually to its renewal or termination. The platform will provide automated and manual controls for each stage of the lifecycle:

* **Subscription Initiation:** (Pre-lifecycle, for completeness) When a subscription is first created – either via a customer signup or an admin creating it – the system sets the initial state. If there is a free trial, the initial state might be “trial” until payment begins. Otherwise, it starts as “active”. The **start date** is recorded, and the **next billing date** is set according to the plan.
* **Renewals (Auto-Renewal):** For recurring subscriptions (most plans):

  * The platform shall **automatically renew subscriptions** at the end of each billing period by generating the next invoice and (if auto-pay is enabled) charging the payment method. The default for most plans is auto-renewal (unless explicitly configured as one-time or fixed-term).
  * The system should support **manual renewal** for cases where auto-renewal is off. For example, if a customer opts out of auto-renew (common in some jurisdictions or by preference), the subscription could move to an “expiring” status at end of term and require the customer to actively renew via the portal or for an admin to renew. The platform must send notifications in these cases (e.g., “Your subscription is about to expire, click here to renew”) and allow easy renewal (which essentially just extends the term and creates a new billing event).
  * **Renewal Reminders:** Prior to auto-renewal charges, the system should send out reminder notifications to customers, especially for longer billing cycles (e.g., an annual plan – send a reminder 30 days before renewal). This is often required by law (for example, some regions like California require notification of renewal for subscriptions). The notification content (and timing) should be configurable.
  * **Renewal Term Changes:** If a subscription was initially for a fixed term (like a 1-year contract), renewal might involve transitioning to a new term possibly with updated pricing. The system should handle that by either automatically continuing if auto-renew is set (maybe creating a new contract period record) or requiring admin action to set up a renewal. This overlaps with contract management logic above.
  * **Grace Periods:** The platform can allow a grace period after failed renewal payment. For instance, if a monthly renewal payment fails, the system can keep the subscription active for a grace period (say 1 week) while retrying payment (dunning, see below) before actually marking it as lapsed. During grace, perhaps the status shows as “past due” but not canceled yet.
* **Mid-Cycle Upgrades/Downgrades:** Users (through self-service or admin on their behalf) can **change the subscription plan** while it’s active:

  * **Upgrading** to a higher tier (or adding more quantity/license):

    * The change can be made effective immediately. The system will calculate a **prorated charge** for the remaining period of the current cycle if the new plan is more expensive. This prorated amount will either be charged immediately or added to the next invoice, depending on configuration (charging immediately is common so that the customer pays the difference right away).
    * The subscription’s plan is updated in the system, and a record of the plan change is kept (e.g., an entry in a Plan Change History table with date of change, old plan, new plan).
    * The billing date usually remains the same (i.e., the cycle doesn’t restart, they just pay more for the remainder and then the full new price on the next normal billing date). The platform should handle aligning these correctly.
    * If the upgrade involves increasing the quantity (like number of users/seats), the system should reflect the new quantity and adjust billing accordingly (prorating any additional users).
    * Notifications: Ideally, the system sends a confirmation to the customer of the upgrade and any immediate charges.
  * **Downgrading** to a lower tier:

    * The platform may either apply the downgrade at the next billing cycle (common practice, to avoid refund complications – the user continues on their current higher plan until period end, then moves to lower plan). This could be the default unless the admin chooses immediate.
    * If a **downgrade is done immediately**, the system should similarly prorate – likely resulting in a **credit** for the unused portion of the higher plan. This credit can be applied to future invoices or potentially refunded according to policy. The platform should support credit handling (e.g., create a credit note or account credit entry).
    * In either case, record the change in plan history with effective date.
    * Some downgrades might reduce available features – the platform should perhaps warn or enforce constraints (for example, if you downgrade below your current usage, might need to reduce usage first).
    * Notification to the customer about the upcoming or immediate change is advisable.
  * **Plan Change Validation:** The system should validate that the target plan is compatible (e.g., if the user is on a legacy plan, what are allowed moves). Possibly provide suggestions in UI for available upgrade/downgrade options. This logic can be driven by plan metadata (like upgrade path definitions).
  * **Plan History:** Maintain a **plan change history** for each subscription: each record shows subscription ID, old plan, new plan, and date of change. This allows auditing and also accurate calculation of revenue (since a subscription’s value might have changed over time). It is also useful for customer support to see what changes happened.
* **Subscription Pausing (Temporary Suspension):** The platform shall allow subscriptions to be **paused** and later resumed:

  * **Pause Action:** An admin or customer (if permitted) can pause a subscription, meaning **temporarily halt billing and service** for a defined period. For example, a customer going on extended vacation might pause their music subscription for 2 months.
  * When a subscription is paused, its status changes to “Paused” (a distinct state from active/canceled). In paused state:

    * **Billing is not charged** during the pause period. The system essentially skips or postpones invoices that would have come due.
    * The subscription **remains technically active** (not canceled) so that the customer can resume without re-signing up. It's a great option to keep a subscription active while stopping regular payment collection temporarily.
    * Service Access: Depending on business policy, service might be restricted during pause (e.g., user cannot use the service while paused if it's meant to be no-charge). Or some offer “free” access during pause mode with limited features. The platform can support a mode value for pause, e.g., `pause_mode = "free"` (service continues but free) vs “no-service” (access suspended).
  * **Pause Duration:** The user initiating the pause should set how long to pause (e.g., pause until a specified date or for N billing cycles). The system should automatically resume billing after that duration by reactivating the subscription.
  * **Manual Unpause:** There should also be functionality to resume (unpause) earlier if needed. For example, an admin can unpause effective immediately, which returns the subscription to active status and schedules the next billing appropriately.
  * **Effect on Billing Cycle:** The platform needs to decide how pause affects the cycle:

    * If prepaid, possibly extend the current period by the pause duration (i.e., they paid for a month, paused for 1 week, so extend renewal date by 1 week).
    * If pay-as-you-go, simply don’t bill during pause and resume with a new billing date when unpaused.
    * Simpler approach: maintain the same billing date, but issue a 0 charge invoice or skip invoice during pause. However, that could effectively lose revenue unless handled as extension. Many services effectively **extend the renewal date by the pause length**, which the platform should do to be fair.
  * The platform should clearly communicate in the UI what will happen (e.g., “Your next billing date will be pushed out by the duration of the pause”).
  * **Limits on Pausing:** Optionally enforce rules like max pause length (say, at most 3 months in a year) or number of pauses, to avoid abuse. These could be configured per plan or globally.
  * **Audit:** Log who paused and when, and if/when resumed.
* **Resuming Subscription:** When a paused subscription reaches its resume date or a user manually resumes:

  * The status returns to Active.
  * The next billing date is recalculated (likely extended as discussed).
  * If service was suspended, access is restored.
  * A notification might be sent to confirm resumption.
* **Cancellation (Voluntary):** When a customer or admin chooses to cancel a subscription:

  * **Cancellation Request:** The platform should capture the cancellation event and ask for a **cancellation effective date**. Typically:

    * For subscriptions paid in advance, the default effective date is end of the current paid period (so the customer retains access until then and then it stops). This is the most common approach: *cancel at period end*.
    * Alternatively, immediate cancellation could be an option (access revokes immediately). In that case, if there is any unused paid time, the policy might be to forfeit or refund prorated amount. The system should allow the admin to choose immediate vs period-end. If immediate with refund, an admin might have to issue a credit/refund (the platform can compute the amount to refund if needed).
  * **Last Bill and Access:** On cancellation, the system should decide whether to generate any final invoice:

    * If canceling at end of period, no new invoices beyond that point (and subscription auto-expires after the end date). Service remains until end date.
    * If cancel immediate and a refund is due, potentially generate a negative invoice (credit note) or mark in the system that a refund is due. The actual refund transaction might be handled via the payment gateway integration by the admin.
  * **Status:** Mark subscription as “Canceled” (or “Pending Cancellation” if it’s slated for future date). Once the effective end date passes, move to “Expired” state. Canceled/expired subscriptions are not active and not counted in active metrics, but their record remains in the database.
  * **Cancellation Reason:** Prompt to collect a reason for cancellation (via predefined categories and optional comments). Storing cancellation reasons is extremely useful for business insight (and can be reported on – e.g., “cancellations due to price vs due to lack of features”).
  * **Retention Offers:** The system can incorporate a **cancellation flow that attempts to save the subscription**. For example, when a customer initiates cancel on the portal, the system might:

    * Offer an incentive: “Would you stay for a 20% discount for next 3 months?” If the customer accepts, apply a promotion and abort the cancellation (thus retaining them on a discounted plan).
    * Or offer to pause instead: “Not using it right now? Consider pausing instead of canceling.”
    * This “save offer” mechanism should be configurable. The platform might allow an admin to set up a retention offer (like one-time discount) and conditions (e.g., do not show to customers in California due to legal requirements, which is noted: some regions have laws requiring easy cancellation with no obstructions).
    * If the offer is declined or if none is configured, proceed with cancellation.
    * This process should be careful to **comply with regulations** (e.g., giving a one-click cancel option as required in some places, while still optionally providing an incentive step that's skippable).
  * **Notification:** Send a cancellation confirmation to the customer (including effective date of termination). Also possibly notify an internal team (so account reps know of churn immediately).
* **Involuntary Cancellation (Failures/Dunning):** Sometimes cancellations happen not by user choice but due to failed payments or other issues:

  * The Dunning process (see Payment section) will try multiple retries for failed payments. If after the configured retries the payment still fails, the platform may **automatically cancel the subscription for non-payment**. In such a case, the cancellation reason is “payment failure” and the system should mark it accordingly.
  * Alternatively, it might move to an “Suspended” state awaiting payment if the business prefers not to cancel outright. (Some businesses give extra time or convert account to limited free access until payment is resolved).
  * If ultimately canceled for non-payment, the system should treat it like cancellation – end the subscription, send notices (“We have canceled your subscription due to inability to collect payment”), and possibly restrict new sign-ups until debt cleared.
  * Also consider **external triggers**: e.g., if a company is acquired and their subscriptions must be terminated, or a compliance issue requires termination. Admins should be able to cancel in bulk if needed (though rare).
* **Reactivation:** If a customer wants to restart a canceled subscription:

  * If the subscription recently ended (say within a grace period or a short time after expiry), the platform could allow reactivation without full re-signup. This could restore their old subscription record (perhaps with a new start date and picking up where left off). For example, if within 30 days of cancellation, simply re-enable the subscription with the same plan and possibly waive any re-setup fees.
  * If reactivated after a long gap, it might be treated as a brand new subscription (with a new start date and potentially new terms).
  * The platform should allow an admin to reactivate an expired subscription record and choose how to handle billing (maybe start a new billing cycle immediately or at next cycle).
  * In the customer portal, provide an easy path for recently churned customers to restart (if business chooses to offer).
  * Reactivations should be logged, and ideally linked to the original subscription record (maybe the same record reopened or a new record with reference to old).
  * If the old plan is no longer available, the admin might have to pick a new plan to reactivate on (the system can suggest equivalent current plan).
* **Expiration of Fixed-Term Subscriptions:** If a subscription was truly non-renewing (like a 6-month gift subscription that doesn’t auto-renew), the system should mark it as “Expired” at term end and not renew or charge further. Notifications to renew or extend could be sent to try converting them to a regular subscription. Otherwise, the record is closed out. This is effectively a cancellation at a predetermined future date, which the system handles automatically.
* **Audit Trail:** All lifecycle actions (renewal, plan change, pause, resume, cancel, etc.) must be recorded in an **audit log** with timestamp and the user (admin or customer via portal) who initiated it. This ensures accountability and aids support in retracing what happened on an account.
* **Status Visibility:** The platform should provide clear visibility into each subscription’s state and next steps:

  * For each active subscription, show next billing date and amount.
  * If “Pending Cancellation,” show the end date.
  * If paused, show since when and until when.
  * If past due, show that it’s in dunning with X retries left, etc.
  * This status info helps customer support answer inquiries quickly (e.g., “Your account is set to expire on June 30 because…”) and also drives automated emails.
* **Lifecycle Event Notifications:** Summarizing some mentioned points – the system will send out notifications for important lifecycle events to customers (and maybe internal teams):

  * Upcoming renewal (especially annual).
  * Trial expiring.
  * Payment failed (which may lead to cancellation if not resolved).
  * Subscription canceled/ended.
  * Subscription paused/resumed.
  * Plan changed (confirmation of upgrade/downgrade).

By managing all these aspects, the platform will ensure that subscriptions can flow smoothly from start to finish in an automated way, while giving users (customers and admins) the controls they need. For example, a customer could upgrade their plan mid-month and the system would seamlessly charge the difference and start the higher service immediately, leveraging proration logic. Or if a customer forgets to update an expired credit card, the system’s dunning and grace period prevent immediate loss, and only if unrecoverable will it cancel the subscription. Each of these transitions is handled according to defined rules so that there is consistency and clarity, minimizing confusion and errors in the subscription lifecycle.

### Upsells and Cross-Sells Management

To drive revenue growth, the platform will include features to identify and facilitate **upsell** and **cross-sell** opportunities. Upselling is encouraging customers to move to higher-priced tiers or add-ons of a product they already have, while cross-selling is offering customers additional different products related to what they have. The system will support the sales and success teams in managing these opportunities through data insights and tools.

* **Definition of Terms:** The platform should use consistent definitions:

  * **Upsell:** Selling a higher level of service or a larger package to an existing subscription. E.g., convincing a customer on a Basic plan to upgrade to Premium, or increasing their user count/package size. **It’s about a larger or enhanced version of the same product/service**.
  * **Cross-Sell:** Selling a different product or service to an existing customer in addition to what they already have. E.g., a customer of Product A is pitched Product B which complements it. **It’s about additional related products** beyond the current subscription.
  * The UI and documentation should clarify these to users (maybe in a glossary or help tooltip) so that the internal team knows what counts as upsell vs cross-sell.
* **Opportunity Identification:** The platform shall automatically flag potential upsell/cross-sell opportunities by analyzing subscription data:

  * **Usage Thresholds:** If usage data is integrated (for instance, if a plan has limits like 1000 transactions per month and a customer consistently hits that or is approaching it), flag this customer as a candidate for a higher tier with more capacity. A rule could be: when a customer uses >80% of their plan’s limit regularly, mark “Upsell potential: likely needs higher plan.”
  * **Feature Gaps:** If customers on lower tiers try to use features that are in higher tiers (this data might come from the product, if available), log that and flag them.
  * **Multiple Subscriptions Indicators:** If a single customer/account holds multiple separate subscriptions of a similar kind, it might be more cost-effective as a single higher-tier subscription. The system could detect such patterns.
  * **Time on Current Plan:** Customers who have been on a basic plan for a long time and fully adopted the product might be ready to hear about advanced features in higher plans. The system could list all customers on each plan by tenure as potential upsell targets (long tenure on low plan might indicate loyalty and readiness).
  * **Cross-Sell Triggers:** If the platform manages multiple products, identify customers who have one product but not another. For example: “Customer has Subscription to Product X but not Product Y” – this is a cross-sell opportunity for Product Y. Reports or dashboards can highlight counts of such customers.
  * The platform might provide a **Cross-Sell Matrix**: a view showing which customers have combinations of products and highlighting gaps (common in CRM/marketing tools, but our system holds subscription info to do it).
  * For example, if we have Product A, B, C:

    * 30 customers have A only,
    * 20 have B only,
    * 10 have A+B,
    * 5 have A+C, etc.
      The system can present lists like “Customers with A but not B” to target B at them.
  * **Customer Health (via Integration):** If integrated with a customer success system (or through data import), things like customer health scores or NPS could be used – usually you upsell happy customers (good health). While this may be outside the direct scope, the platform should allow capturing a “health score” field per customer (through API or manual input) to assist in filtering which opportunities to pursue.
* **Opportunity Management Interface:** The platform should provide an interface (or at least data exports) for sales teams to manage these opportunities:

  * Possibly a dashboard or report like **“Upsell Opportunities”** listing customers, the suggested upsell (e.g., “upgrade to Premium plan”), and data supporting it (current usage, potential revenue increase if upsold).
  * Similarly a **“Cross-Sell Opportunities”** report listing customers and which product you could sell them (e.g., “Customer X has Software Subscription, consider cross-selling the Training Subscription”).
  * These could be interactive: e.g., checkboxes to mark that sales has reached out, or notes fields to log status (or simply export these lists to CSV/CRM).
  * If the platform is integrated with a CRM (like Salesforce), it might simply provide the data via API and let the CRM handle actual opportunity tracking. In that case, the requirement is to ensure all relevant subscription data can sync to CRM, where salespeople can see “this customer is eligible for product B upsell”.
* **Automated Triggers/Alerts:** The system can send internal alerts for upsell/cross-sell:

  * For example, email or in-app notification to the account owner or success manager when a certain threshold is hit: “Account ABC Co. has 100% of licenses utilized – consider proposing an upgrade.”
  * Or a weekly summary to sales: “You have 5 customers on outdated plans that could be upgraded.”
  * These triggers should be configurable (which events trigger, who gets notified).
* **In-App Sales Offers:** If the platform includes customer-facing components (like a customer portal), it could be used to gently promote upgrades:

  * E.g., in the portal, if a customer’s usage is high or a feature is not available on their plan, show a message or banner: “Looking for more? Upgrade to Pro for unlimited usage.” However, this borders on marketing content; it should be subtle and useful. This could be implemented as part of UI/UX design, not necessarily heavy logic beyond checking plan and usage.
  * The requirements would be: ability to configure promotional messages in the portal tied to plan states. This is a nice-to-have for self-service upsells.
* **Execution of Upsell/Cross-sell:** Once an opportunity is identified and the customer agrees to it, the platform should make the process of upgrading or adding subscriptions straightforward (as covered in lifecycle management):

  * For upsell: the admin or customer can perform the plan upgrade immediately and the system will handle billing adjustments automatically.
  * For cross-sell: the admin can create a new subscription for the additional product under the customer’s account (or the customer can self-serve subscribe via the portal if enabled to purchase add-ons), and it will be linked to their profile with unified billing if applicable (some customers might want a single bill for all their subscriptions).
  * Ensure that when adding a new subscription for an existing customer, information is pre-filled and any multi-subscription discounts are applied if the business offers such (for instance, “add Product B to an existing Product A subscriber and get 10% off” – the platform should support that via promotional rules).
* **Monitoring Upsell/Cross-sell Metrics:** As part of metrics tracking:

  * The platform should measure **upsell rate** (how much of revenue or how many customers have upgraded) and **cross-sell take rate** (how many have multiple products). For example: “44% of SaaS companies get >10% of new revenue from upselling and cross-selling” – our platform should help produce such insights for its user.
  * It can log each time an upsell occurs (like a plan change from lower to higher) and attribute revenue growth to upsell. Similarly track how many customers have >1 subscription (a cross-sell success).
  * These metrics can be part of reporting/analytics.
* **Integration with Marketing Automation:** The platform might provide data to marketing tools to run upsell campaigns. E.g., export list of customers who haven’t bought product B for an email campaign. As long as data is accessible (via APIs or export), dedicated marketing automation can be used. The requirement is to ensure data like “has Product A but not B” can be obtained easily.
* **User Roles for Sales:** Possibly define a user role for sales or account managers who can log into the platform and view a **book-of-business** style dashboard: see all their accounts, current subscriptions, and opportunities. This ties in with the roles and permissions section, but essentially, a salesperson should be able to use the platform as a CRM-lite for subscription data: see which of their accounts could be upsold/cross-sold.
* **Playbook Example:** Imagine a **success manager** logs in and sees:

  * **Account XYZ Corp:** On “Standard Plan”, using 95% of allowed API calls. *Flag:* Upsell to Premium recommended (would increase MRR by \$500). The manager calls the client, negotiates, and via the platform upgrades their plan. Now the account’s flag is cleared and MRR increases.
  * **Account ACME Inc:** Currently subscribes to Product 1 but not Product 2. They have high usage of Product 1. *Flag:* Cross-sell Product 2 (which many in their industry use together). The manager notes it in CRM to discuss on next QBR. Possibly triggers a trial for Product 2.
* **Cross-Sell Bundling:** The platform can also assist in creating attractive bundles as upsell paths. E.g., if many customers have A and separate B, perhaps suggest bundling them. The system can highlight common product combinations to product managers (insight: “X customers have both A and B separately – consider a bundle pricing for them.”)

While some of these tasks (like actually convincing the customer) happen outside the system, the platform’s job is to **surface the data and provide the tools to act**. By implementing these features, the subscription platform not only manages existing revenue but actively contributes to revenue expansion. It essentially overlaps with some CRM functionality but specifically geared towards subscription upgrade paths.

The end result is a higher **average revenue per customer** as more customers move to premium tiers or adopt multiple offerings, something the platform facilitates through intelligent prompts and ease of execution.

### Customer Account and Information Management

The platform will maintain a robust **customer account database**, storing all relevant information about each customer (subscriber) and their subscriptions. Secure and comprehensive customer data management is vital for billing, support, personalization, and compliance.

* **Customer Accounts:** The system shall have a Customer (or Account) entity representing the subscribing entity. In a B2B context, this typically corresponds to a company or organization (which may have multiple users/contacts associated). In some cases, it could also be an individual consumer if the business sells to individuals – the platform should support either, but primary use is B2B.

  * Each Customer Account will have a unique identifier (Customer ID).
  * Key fields for a Customer:

    * **Company/Name:** The official name of the customer (Company name for businesses, Full name for individuals).
    * **Contact Details:** Primary contact person’s name, email, phone number. Possibly secondary contacts as needed (billing contact, technical contact, etc.). There may be multiple associated contacts; the platform should allow storing several and labeling them (e.g., “Billing Contact: Jane Doe, email…; Technical Contact: John Doe, email…”).
    * **Address:** Billing address (for invoices) and optionally shipping address (for physical goods). Possibly multiple addresses if needed (headquarters vs branch, or billing vs shipping).
    * **Customer Segment/Type:** Attributes like industry, size (number of employees), region, etc., if relevant and provided. These can be used for filtering in reports or special pricing rules.
    * **Tax/VAT Information:** If B2B, store tax ID (like VAT ID in EU) for tax exemption or invoicing needs. Also a field to mark if the customer is tax-exempt (which the billing logic will use not to charge tax if applicable).
    * **Status:** Indicate if the account is active, on-hold, or closed. For example, an account might be put on hold due to non-payment (affecting all their subscriptions).
    * **Creation Date:** When the account was created in the system.
    * **Custom Fields:** The system should allow additional custom attributes to be stored if the business needs (e.g., Account Manager Name, Customer Tier like Gold/Silver, etc.). These could be configured through a custom field mechanism or simply via an extendable schema.
* **User Management under Account:** If applicable, the platform can distinguish between the **Customer Account (the company)** and **Users** (logins) who belong to that account.

  * For example, ACME Corp is a customer, with three user logins on the self-service portal (Alice, Bob, Charlie). Those users can manage the subscriptions for ACME according to roles (maybe Alice is an admin user, Bob is read-only, etc.).
  * The system should support multiple user logins per customer account, with role-based permissions (detailed in User Roles section). At minimum, a primary contact with login credentials, and ability to invite others.
  * Each user would have Name, Email, Password (if not using SSO), Role, and association to the Customer Account.
  * If this is implemented, also provide UI for customer admins to manage their users (e.g., an admin at ACME can invite colleagues to also view subscriptions).
  * (This is more of a UI/portal feature, but noted here as part of customer info management.)
* **Subscription Associations:** The customer record will be linked to all subscriptions they own. In the data model, a Subscription will have a `customer_id` foreign key linking to the Customer table. Thus, from a customer account view, one can see a list of all active (and past) subscriptions associated with that customer. This one-to-many relationship is fundamental.
* **Billing History:** For each customer, the system shall maintain a **billing history**:

  * List of all invoices issued to that customer, with dates, amounts, status (paid, due, overdue).
  * Payment transactions corresponding to those invoices (payments made, method used, transaction IDs, dates).
  * Credits or adjustments applied (credit notes, refunds).
  * This allows customer support or finance to quickly view a timeline of billing events for the customer. For example, “Invoice #1001 on Jan 1, paid Jan 3 via Visa ending 4242, Invoice #1002 on Feb 1, payment failed, retried Feb 3 successful…”.
  * The platform should provide this history in the UI under the customer account or in reports, and allow exporting it for an account.
  * Ensure that historical invoices remain accessible even if the subscription is canceled (for record-keeping).
* **Contracts/Documents:** The system should allow storing or linking **contracts or agreements** tied to the customer or specific subscriptions. This might be:

  * Uploading a PDF of a signed contract to the customer’s profile or a particular subscription.
  * Or storing a reference number to an external contract management system.
  * Also capturing key contract terms (like contract end date, notice period) as data fields as discussed in multi-year section.
  * This helps in managing enterprise customers especially – all relevant paperwork can be traced.
  * If storing documents, ensure secure storage (maybe encrypted, and only authorized internal users can download).
* **Preferences and Settings:** Each customer may have **account-level preferences**:

  * **Preferred Language** for communications (if multi-lingual support is planned for notifications/invoices).
  * **Preferred Currency** (if the system allows billing in different currencies, a customer might be set to always be billed in EUR vs USD).
  * **Communication Preferences:** e.g., does the customer want email receipts, or CC certain addresses on invoices. Possibly allow opting in/out of certain notifications (except mandatory billing ones).
  * **Payment Preferences:** e.g., this customer prefers manual invoicing vs auto-charge. Or net payment terms (some B2B customers might pay via bank transfer net 30 days rather than immediate card charge – the system can mark that in their profile so invoices for them have a due date +30 days).
  * **Billing Day Alignments:** Some customers might have a custom billing cycle alignment (e.g., they want all their subscriptions prorated to bill on the 1st of the month). The system could support setting a “billing day” for the account to align multiple subscriptions, if offered by the business.
* **Payment Details (Stored Payment Methods):** For customers using automatic payments, the platform needs to securely store their payment details:

  * This likely includes one or more credit card tokens or bank account tokens from the payment gateway. **No raw sensitive card data (PAN/CVV) will be stored** on our servers to remain PCI compliant – instead, we use the gateway’s vault tokens.
  * The system should record for each stored payment method: type (Visa, MasterCard, Amex or ACH, etc.), masked number (last 4 digits), expiration (for cards), account holder name, billing address if needed, and a token/reference.
  * Allow multiple payment methods on file per account (a primary and backups). For example, a customer might have a primary corporate card and a secondary card or bank account. The platform can attempt the primary and fall back to secondary if primary fails (if configured).
  * Indicate which payment method is the default for auto-charges. Allow customers/admins to update these via UI (which will integrate with gateway to update token info as needed).
  * If customers are on manual payment terms, this section might be empty or just note “Manual – pay by invoice”.
  * These details must be handled with high security (encrypted storage of tokens, display only masked info, strict access control) and compliance to PCI DSS standards (since even storing a token and customer name/email means we still have some cardholder data context). The system will ensure cardholder data is **encrypted at rest and in transit**.
* **Security of Personal Data:** All personal identifiable information (PII) like names, emails, addresses, and payment data should be stored securely:

  * Use encryption for sensitive fields in the database (especially anything like personal addresses, and definitely any API keys or tokens for payment methods).
  * Implement access controls so that only authorized roles can view or edit certain info (e.g., customer support can see last4 of card but not full number which we don’t store anyway).
  * The platform should be built to comply with privacy laws (GDPR etc.), meaning it should be able to delete or anonymize a customer’s personal data upon request (see compliance section for details).
  * Keep audit logs of any changes to customer data for security and compliance.
* **Customer Hierarchies (if needed):** In some B2B cases, one organization might have sub-accounts (for instance, a parent company with several subsidiaries each with their own subscriptions). The platform could allow linking customer accounts in a hierarchy (“Parent Account” field). This might not be a core requirement unless needed for consolidated billing. If implemented:

  * Allow a parent account to see child accounts’ subscriptions.
  * Possibly roll-up billing or reports for the parent.
  * This complexity can be phased if not immediately needed.
* **Single Customer View:** In the admin UI, there should be a **Customer Profile page** that shows all relevant info at a glance:

  * Account details (name, contacts, etc.).
  * Active subscriptions (with brief details like plan, status, next billing).
  * Past subscriptions (historical, maybe collapsed or in an archive section).
  * Recent invoices and payments (with links to full invoice detail).
  * Buttons or links to perform actions like “Create New Subscription for this Customer”, “Record a Manual Payment”, “Edit Account Info”, “Cancel all Subscriptions” (if needed), etc.
  * This page essentially acts as a mini-CRM view for the customer within the subscription system.
* **Search and Filters:** The platform should allow users to easily find customer accounts by various criteria:

  * Quick search by company name, contact name, email, or customer ID.
  * Filter lists of customers by attributes (e.g., show all customers with at least one active subscription, or all in a certain region, or all with overdue invoices).
  * Sort customers by name, revenue, renewal date, etc., in the admin list views.
* **Data Import/Export:** There should be capability to import existing customer lists (when migrating from another system) and to export the customer list (for backup, analysis or migration). Import might involve CSV upload mapping fields to create accounts and possibly initial subscriptions (with appropriate safety checks).
* **Retention of Data:** Even after a customer cancels all subscriptions, the customer account record remains (unless explicitly deleted per GDPR request). This retains their history should they return or for historical revenue records. Such an account could be marked as inactive or archived to exclude from active counts.
* **Integration Considerations:** The customer data in the platform often needs to sync with a CRM (like Salesforce, Hubspot) which is the master for customer info in many companies. Requirements here:

  * The platform should be considered the source of truth for subscription status and billing info, while CRM is source for sales pipeline and perhaps master of contact info.
  * Ensure the platform can either import basic info from CRM when needed or export subscription status to CRM. This would be via the APIs (e.g., an integration that updates CRM fields like “Current Plan” or “MRR” for an account).
  * If an account is updated in one system, processes should be in place to update the other accordingly (this is detailed in Integration section).
* **Examples:**

  * **Enterprise Customer Example:** ACME Corp’s account is set up with Billing Contact “Jane Doe ([jane@acme.com](mailto:jane@acme.com))” and Tech Contact “IT Support ([support@acme.com](mailto:support@acme.com))”. They have a VAT ID recorded as “EU12345678” and marked tax-exempt in certain jurisdiction. ACME has 3 active subscriptions (Software X – Premium, Software Y – Standard, Hardware Service – Annual) all listed on their profile. They prefer consolidated billing, so the system generates a single invoice that aggregates the charges for X, Y, and Hardware annually. Their preferred payment method is a tokenized AMEX card (last4 0015) which is set to auto-pay each invoice. ACME’s profile shows an attachment of their signed 2-year contract PDF. The account is linked to parent MegaCorp Inc in hierarchy. On ACME’s page, a support agent can see they’ve been a customer since 2019, their average annual spend (maybe in a summary), and that their next renewal for the Software X is coming up in 3 months.
  * **SMB Customer Example:** John Smith (an individual or small biz) subscribes to a monthly service. His account record just has his name, email, and card token. He manages everything himself through the portal. If he updates his card, the new token replaces the old on his account. When he cancels, his account remains with status “inactive” with one canceled subscription, and his data will be retained for a period unless deletion is requested.

In summary, the platform’s customer management functions serve as the foundation underpinning all subscription operations. It’s where billing is anchored and where one goes to understand the context for any subscription. Ensuring this is comprehensive and well-structured will result in smoother billing operations, easier support interactions, and solid data for analysis and decision-making. All of this will be done while maintaining high standards of **data security and privacy**, given the sensitivity of personal and payment information stored.

### Payment Processing (Automatic & Manual Payments)

Handling payments is a critical function of the subscription platform. The system must accommodate both **automatic recurring payments** (where the platform charges the customer’s saved payment method on a schedule) and **manual payment methods** (where an invoice is issued and the customer pays it via bank transfer, check, etc.). It should support a variety of payment options to meet customer preferences and ensure cash flow.

* **Multiple Payment Methods Support:** The platform shall integrate with multiple payment channels and gateways:

  * **Credit/Debit Cards:** Primary method for many SaaS – Visa, MasterCard, Amex, etc. The system will securely store card tokens and automatically charge cards for recurring payments. It must comply with PCI DSS standards to process card payments securely. (We rely on a PCI-compliant gateway, but our software also should enforce TLS, not store CVV, etc.)
  * **Bank Transfers / ACH / Direct Debit:** Support customers who prefer to pay via bank debit (like ACH in the US, SEPA Direct Debit in EU). This may involve integrating with gateways like Stripe ACH, GoCardless, etc. For automatic recurring debit, the system collects a mandate from the customer and then can pull payments each cycle. Alternatively, for manual bank transfer, the system generates an invoice and expects the customer to send funds; an admin would then mark the invoice paid once funds are received.
  * **Digital Wallets:** Options like PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay. PayPal, for instance, can be offered for initial payments or even recurring via PayPal Subscriptions/Billing Agreements. If integrated, the system may redirect the user to PayPal to approve a billing agreement, then treat it similarly to a saved payment method token.
  * **Other Methods:** If needed for international: e.g., local payment methods (Alipay, WeChat Pay, etc.) – likely not in initial scope unless target market requires. Platform should be extensible to add these later via gateway integrations.
  * **Multiple Gateways:** The platform might allow connecting to more than one payment gateway provider in parallel. For instance, use Stripe for cards and GoCardless for ACH. Or use regional gateways for certain customers. The system design should keep the payment integration abstract enough to plug in various providers.
  * Each payment method stored on file should be associated with the appropriate gateway token and method type, as mentioned in Customer Info.
* **Automatic Recurring Payments:**

  * For subscriptions with auto-pay enabled, the system will automatically attempt to charge the customer’s default payment method on the invoice due date. This process needs to be reliable and handle success/failure cases:

    * If charge succeeds, mark invoice paid, send receipt.
    * If charge is declined or fails, enter dunning process (see Dunning below).
  * The platform’s job is to communicate with the payment gateway through secure API calls. For example, on due date call “charge customer X’s saved payment method Y for \$Z”. The gateway replies success or error with reason code.
  * **PCI Compliance:** The system should not expose card data. All card info is stored as token or in gateway. The platform ensures **PCI compliance by using certified gateways and storing only tokens**. It should also undergo PCI compliance audits as needed for a service provider.
  * The platform should **log transaction IDs** from the gateway for reconciliation. Each payment attempt (successful or failed) gets recorded with date/time, amount, and gateway response (for audit and troubleshooting).
  * **Scheduling:** The system must reliably schedule these payment attempts. Typically, when an invoice is generated, if auto-pay is on and invoice date == charge date, attempt immediately. Or more simply, run a daily job that picks all due invoices of the day and processes them.
  * Optionally support charging slightly before due date if needed (some businesses attempt a few days early to allow retries before expiration of service).
* **Manual Payments and Invoicing:**

  * For customers on manual payment (common in B2B where clients prefer to pay by wire transfer or check upon receiving an invoice):

    * The platform generates an invoice and marks it as **Payment Due** with a due date (like Net 30 days from issuance, or due immediately).
    * The invoice will include instructions for payment (which could be customized per the vendor’s details: bank account info, etc. – possibly in invoice template).
    * The customer receives the invoice (via email or portal). They then initiate payment offline (send a check or transfer).
    * An admin or an automated bank integration then marks the invoice as paid on the date funds are confirmed. The platform should allow recording a manual payment on an invoice: specify date, amount (could be full or partial), method (e.g., “Wire transfer reference #12345”). Partial payments should be supported if, for example, a customer underpays \$X then pays the remainder later.
    * If an invoice goes past due date without payment, that should trigger reminders and possibly account suspension or cancellation similar to failed auto-pay (dunning applies to manual pay too, but the chasing is via reminders).
    * There could be integration with accounting software or bank to automatically update payment status (but likely manual marking by AR team).
  * The platform should support marking an invoice as paid, partially paid, or writing it off if needed (if the business decides to waive it).
* **Dunning Management (Failed Payment Handling):** When automatic payment fails (card declined, etc.), the platform must have a **dunning process** to attempt recovery:

  * Immediately mark the invoice as failed attempt and notify the customer (e.g., an email “Your payment failed, please update your card”).
  * Retry logic: configurable rules such as **retry after 3 days, then after 5 more days, etc.** Many use strategies like retry in 3 days, then 5 days, then 7 days, etc., for a few attempts (or what gateway’s smart retry recommends).
  * Possibly use gateway’s built-in retry if available, or manage it internally.
  * During this period, keep subscription active but flag it as “Past Due” or “Delinquent” internally.
  * Keep sending reminders to customer to update payment information in between attempts. Ideally provide a link to update their card on file (customer portal has that capability).
  * If a retry succeeds at a later attempt, mark invoice paid, clear the past due status, and send confirmation.
  * If after all retries (say after 4 attempts over 2 weeks) it still fails, then escalate:

    * Option 1: **Auto-cancel** the subscription for non-payment. This is common – after giving sufficient chance, the service is terminated. The system will then cancel subscription, and notify the customer (and internal team).
    * Option 2: **Suspend access** but not cancel – some prefer to suspend for a grace period to allow payment later while keeping data. This might require manual intervention to reactivate if payment eventually comes. The platform could mark subscription as Suspended. If payment arrives (maybe via a different method later), the admin can reactivate.
    * Option 3: Move to manual collection – e.g., flag for the finance team to follow up personally.
    * The system should allow configuration of which approach to take or at least allow admin override at final stage.
  * All steps in dunning should be logged. Many subscription platforms provide a dunning configuration UI to set how many retries and emails. We should at least have it configurable in settings or code.
  * The **dunning communications** (emails) should be customizable for tone and branding. They should clearly instruct how to update payment or contact support to resolve.
* **Payment Notifications:** Aside from dunning, normal notifications:

  * Send **payment receipts** for successful charges to customers (this can include invoice PDF or details).
  * Send **payment failure notices** as mentioned.
  * Possibly send advance notice for large charges (some companies email a few days before charging annual renewals or any charge above a threshold as courtesy).
  * Internal notifications: alert finance if any large payment fails or if any payment requires review (fraud screening possibly done by gateway, but we might surface flags).
* **Multiple Currency Handling:** If the business sells in multiple currencies:

  * Each customer or subscription might be designated a billing currency (usually based on customer locale or choice). Prices might be set per currency or converted on the fly (prefer per currency to avoid exchange rate issues).
  * The platform should store currency for each invoice and handle different currency amounts properly (sums, reporting per currency, etc.).
  * Integrations with gateways must support those currencies.
  * Financial reporting needs to separate or convert currencies (non-trivial, possibly outside immediate scope except basic tracking).
  * For simplicity, maybe initial scope is one base currency, but architecture should consider currency extensibility.
* **Refunds:** The platform should allow issuing refunds for payments if needed:

  * A refund can be full or partial on a payment transaction. This is often needed if a customer cancels mid-period and is owed money back, or was mistakenly charged.
  * The system should integrate with gateway’s refund API to actually push the refund to customer’s card/bank.
  * It should then record that refund in the invoice/payment history (like link it to the original invoice or payment record, showing refunded amount and date).
  * If partial refund, an invoice may go from paid to partially paid state (or remain paid but with an attached credit memo).
  * Also consider if refund is given not through original method (like issuing account credit instead or offline refund), the platform should allow recording that manually.
* **Partial Payments & Overpayments:**

  * Partial: If a customer pays only part of an invoice (common in manual payments, e.g. they short-pay \$5), the system marks how much is paid and shows balance remaining. Possibly continue dunning for remaining balance if significant.
  * Overpayment: If a customer overpays (e.g., sends \$1100 for a \$1000 invoice), the system should either allow applying the extra \$100 as **credit on account** for future invoices or refund it. The system should support carrying an account credit balance.
  * Account Credits: Admins can add or manage credits on a customer account (which might come from overpayments or goodwill credits). These credits should automatically apply to the next invoice(s) for that customer. The platform should show available credit on invoices and deduct it from amount due. Managing credits carefully ensures they are not forgotten. This is a more advanced AR feature, but useful.
* **Payment Gateway Integration & Testing:**

  * All gateway interactions (charge, refund, store card, etc.) should be thoroughly tested using gateway sandbox environments.
  * The platform likely needs a mode to use test API keys vs live keys, and perhaps a way to simulate/test payments in a non-production environment easily (for QA and integration testing).
* **Security & Compliance:**

  * Use tokenization for cards: The platform front-end or server should integrate with gateway's JS or API to tokenize card info so that raw card number never hits our server (if possible). If not, then ensure our network is PCI compliant to handle it briefly and immediately send to gateway for tokenizing.
  * **Encryption** for any sensitive data stored (we already mention tokens, personal data encryption).
  * **3D Secure / SCA:** With regulations like PSD2 in EU, the platform must handle Strong Customer Authentication for card payments. This often means triggering 3D Secure verification for a payment. Integration with gateways like Stripe can handle it by requiring a redirect or popup for user to authenticate the payment. For recurring charges, often exemptions apply, but the system should be capable of handling cases where SCA is needed (especially for the first payment or if card issuer demands it on renewal). This may require user interaction – possibly sending a link if an off-session charge gets a challenge. This is advanced, but important in EU markets.
  * **Fraud Prevention:** Largely handled by gateway’s fraud tools, but the platform should allow integration of any fraud signals (e.g., do not auto-provision subscription until payment clears fraud checks).
* **Audit & Logs:** Every payment attempt, invoice creation, payment receipt, refund, etc., should be logged internally. There should be an audit trail for transactions for financial reconciliation and in case of disputes.
* **Payment Calendar:** The system might provide a calendar view for finance to see upcoming payments (e.g., “next week we are set to charge X amount from Y customers”), which can help in cash flow planning. Not a must-have but a possible feature.
* **Integration with Accounting:** Provide data export or integration to accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.) containing invoice and payment info, so the finance team can reconcile and account for revenue. Possibly generate journal entries if needed (though often simpler to just export transactions).

**Examples of Payment Flows:**

* *Auto-pay with Credit Card:* Alice’s subscription renews on the 1st of each month. On March 1, the platform generates Invoice #123 for \$50. Immediately, it uses the saved token (Visa ending 1111) to charge \$50 via Stripe. Stripe responds success with txn id `ch_ABC123`. The invoice is marked Paid on Mar 1, a receipt email goes to Alice with invoice attached, and the subscription’s next due date is set to Apr 1. All automated – Alice didn’t have to do anything.
* *Card Failure and Dunning:* Bob’s annual renewal of \$1200 was due Jan 10. The platform tries his MasterCard token on Jan 10 – it declines (insufficient funds). Invoice #500 marked “Payment Failed” on Jan 10. Bob gets an email “We couldn’t charge your card, please update details.” The system will retry in 3 days (Jan 13). Jan 13 attempt fails again (decline). Another email to Bob. The system will retry in 7 more days (Jan 20). Meanwhile, Bob’s subscription is in Past Due status but still active (maybe with a grace period until end of January). On Jan 18, Bob logs into the portal after receiving emails and updates his card to a Visa. On Jan 20, the system attempts again using the new Visa token – it succeeds. Invoice #500 is now Paid on Jan 20, and the subscription goes back to Active/Current status (with next renewal Jan 10 next year). Bob gets a payment success email.
* *Manual Invoice via Bank:* ACME Corp has terms Net 30. On July 1, an invoice for \$5000 is generated for their quarterly renewal, due July 31. It is emailed to their billing contact and also visible on their portal. ACME’s AP department processes it and on July 20 initiates a wire transfer. On July 22, the finance admin checks the bank and sees \$5000 received with reference matching invoice. The admin opens Invoice #250 in the platform and clicks “Mark as Paid”, enters July 22 and reference note. The invoice moves to Paid status. The subscription remains active. If Aug 1 had come with no payment, the system would have flagged it overdue and potentially send reminders to ACME and notify the account manager. Continued non-payment might suspend service by end of August per policy, which the system would handle by an admin action or automated rule.
* *Mixed Methods and Credit:* Another customer might have two subscriptions – one is auto-charged to card, another they prefer to pay by check. The system can support that by setting auto-pay on one subscription/invoice and not on the other, even if under one account (though often it’s account-level setting). Alternatively, treat them separately or the customer pays all manually. Suppose a customer overpaid an invoice by \$100. The platform records a \$100 credit on their account. Next cycle, it generates a \$300 invoice and auto-applies the \$100 credit so the amount due is \$200, then charges card \$200. A note on invoice shows use of credit.

Through these capabilities, the platform ensures that the process of **collecting revenue is as automated and flexible as possible**, reducing friction for customers and workload for financial teams. It supports the **customer’s choice of payment method** while safeguarding the business via robust dunning processes and compliance measures. The ultimate goal is to achieve timely payments with minimal failed collections, thereby **maximizing the realized revenue** from the subscriptions sold.

*(Additional payment integration details, such as specific API endpoints and mapping of gateway features to platform features, will be provided in the Integration section. Security and compliance aspects, including PCI DSS scope, are further discussed in Non-Functional Requirements and Compliance sections.)*

## Non-Functional Requirements

Besides functional capabilities, the platform must meet a set of **non-functional requirements** that ensure it operates efficiently, securely, and reliably. These include performance criteria, security standards, compliance obligations, and general system qualities like scalability and maintainability.

### Performance and Scalability

* **System Performance:** The platform should be optimized to handle a high volume of transactions and user interactions with minimal latency. Key performance goals:

  * **Response Time:** The user interface (for both admins and customers) should be responsive. Page loads or data fetches for typical operations (viewing a customer record, generating an invoice, etc.) should ideally complete in under 2-3 seconds. Real-time actions like form submissions (creating a subscription) should process within a couple of seconds on average, not including any external payment processing time.
  * **Batch Processing:** Operations such as nightly billing jobs (charging all due subscriptions) or generating large reports should complete in a reasonable window. For example, processing a batch of 10,000 renewals should perhaps complete within a few minutes. If needed, such jobs can be distributed or run in parallel to meet time requirements.
  * **Throughput:** The system should support a sufficient number of concurrent users and actions. For instance, it might need to handle dozens of internal users (admins, sales reps) using it simultaneously and thousands of customer portal users self-serving, without performance degradation. It should also handle spikes in activity (e.g., end of month where many subscriptions renew at once, or a large number of customers signing up in a short period due to a promotion).
  * **Data Volume:** Design the database and queries to handle growth. If there are, say, 100,000 customers and each has multiple subscriptions and invoices, the system should still retrieve individual records or lists quickly using proper indexing and querying techniques.
  * **API Performance:** The APIs should similarly respond quickly (with proper pagination for list endpoints to avoid huge payloads). Integration partners will expect prompt responses for data queries (e.g., querying a subscription status via API should return in sub-second time for a single record).
* **Scalability:**

  * The architecture should allow **horizontal scaling** to accommodate increasing load. This means one can add more application server instances to handle more concurrent processes (e.g., more web requests, background jobs) and possibly scale the database (read replicas, partitioning) as data grows.
  * **Multi-Tenancy Efficiency:** If the platform serves multiple vendor clients (multi-tenant in terms of each client company using it to manage their customers), it must isolate and handle each tenant’s load. But here likely the “tenants” are our B2B customers? Actually, the platform itself might be one instance used by one company. If we consider offering the platform as SaaS to multiple vendors, then multi-tenancy is critical (but the context suggests this platform is for one company’s use).
  * **Subscription Scaling:** The system should be tested with scenarios like: 1 million subscriptions, 10 million invoices in the database, etc., to ensure design can handle large scale if the business grows to that. At least ensure no architectural bottlenecks at lower numbers.
  * **Event Processing:** Use asynchronous processing where needed for scalability (for example, sending emails or computing heavy analytics can be done in background threads or workers so as not to slow user actions).
  * **Resource Utilization:** The platform should manage memory and CPU efficiently. Avoid memory leaks or heavy in-memory operations that scale with data size. Use streaming or paging for processing large datasets.
  * **Caching:** Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data that doesn’t change frequently (like plan definitions, or dashboard aggregates) to improve response times and reduce database load. However, caches must be properly invalidated when data changes.
* **High Availability:** Design for minimal downtime:

  * Use redundant server instances behind load balancers so if one instance fails, others continue serving (cloud deployment can help here).
  * For the database, have replication and a failover strategy. Possibly a primary DB and a standby that can take over in case of primary failure.
  * Aim for an **uptime of 99.9% or higher** (meaning only minutes of unscheduled downtime per month). This implies robust infrastructure and quick recovery from failures.
  * Implement health checks and monitoring (non-functional requirement) to detect issues and auto-restart services if needed.
  * Plan maintenance windows wisely and possibly support rolling updates (so not all instances are down at once during deployment).
* **Capacity Planning:** Provide tools or documentation for capacity planning:

  * That is, metrics on current usage (CPU, DB load) and guidelines on when to add more resources. The system should degrade gracefully rather than crash if capacity is exceeded (e.g., maybe slow down but not become entirely unresponsive).
* **Extensibility for Growth:** As the number of features grows, ensure new features do not drastically reduce performance by careful design (e.g., adding a new feature that requires scanning entire datasets should use background processing or be optimized).
* **Testing for Performance:** Include performance testing in QA. Simulate high loads of typical scenarios (multiple concurrent signups, batch renewals, large data exports) to verify the system meets the performance criteria. Adjust as needed (through indexing, code optimization, etc.).
* **Example Load Scenario:** The system might be expected to handle something like 5,000 renewal charges and 50,000 API requests within a 1 hour period (perhaps peak usage when daily jobs run plus customer portal activity). The requirement is that these complete successfully without timeouts or crashes, with maybe slight delays but within acceptable limits.
* **Front-end Performance:** The web UI should load assets (scripts, styles) efficiently, maybe bundling and using CDNs, to make the initial load fast. Use client-side caching (local storage) for things like user session data to reduce repeated calls. Ensure that heavy operations on the client (like rendering a table of 1000 invoices) are optimized or paginated to keep the UI fluid.
* **Concurrent Usage and Data Integrity:** With multiple admins possibly editing data simultaneously (e.g., two different support agents editing the same customer’s subscriptions), the system should handle concurrency gracefully. Implement optimistic locking or at least last-write-wins with proper audit logs to avoid data corruption.
* **Scalability Example:** If the business expands internationally and the subscription count doubles, the architecture (with stateless app servers and scalable DB cluster) should allow simply adding more servers or upgrading hardware to double throughput, rather than requiring re-architecture.

In summary, the non-functional performance goal is to ensure the platform remains **fast and reliable under increasing load**, providing a smooth experience for users and timely processing of all billing events. The system is expected to **scale up** as the business grows, both in terms of user count and data volume, without significant redesign.

### Security

Security is paramount given the platform handles sensitive customer information and financial transactions. The system must implement robust security measures at every level to protect data from unauthorized access, prevent breaches, and ensure trust.

* **Access Control and Authentication:**

  * All user access (admin users, internal staff, and customers on the portal) must be authenticated securely. Use strong password policies (minimum complexity, etc.) and support modern authentication options (e.g., SSO via SAML/OAuth for internal users if needed, or two-factor authentication for admin accounts for added security).
  * Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** so that users only see and do what their role permits. For example, a read-only finance viewer cannot modify subscriptions, and a support agent cannot access system admin settings. Roles and permissions are detailed in the User Roles section, but the security requirement is to enforce those in the application.
  * Ensure session management is secure: use secure cookies, set appropriate session timeouts (especially for admin logins). Possibly implement automatic log-out after a period of inactivity.
  * Protect against session hijacking: use HTTPS (TLS) for all communication (no plaintext), set HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies, consider CSRF tokens for state-changing operations on the web UI.
* **Data Encryption:**

  * All data in transit must be encrypted via TLS. The web application should be served over HTTPS only. Integration calls to external APIs (payment gateways, etc.) must use HTTPS.
  * Sensitive data at rest in the database or storage should be encrypted. This includes:

    * Passwords (store only hashed passwords, using strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2, with salting).
    * Payment tokens/keys (though tokens are not raw card data, treat them carefully; if storing any secret keys, encrypt them).
    * Personal identifiable info (PII) – consider column-level encryption for fields like customer personal data if high security required. At minimum, the database should reside on encrypted storage (disk encryption).
    * **Cardholder data encryption**: As part of PCI compliance, any card data (should be just tokens and maybe last4) is ideally not stored except tokens, but if any PAN were stored it must be encrypted. Our approach is tokenization to avoid storing PAN at all.
  * **Key Management:** Manage encryption keys securely (perhaps relying on cloud KMS if hosted, or have a secure key store). Restrict access to keys to only the necessary components.
* **PCI DSS Compliance:** As the platform deals with payment info, it **must be PCI DSS compliant** or operate in a way to minimize scope (by using external payment vaults). Specifically:

  * Ensure we meet requirements like protecting stored cardholder data (Requirement 3) – as noted, no sensitive auth data stored, and cardholder data (even tokens) protected.
  * Encrypt transmission of cardholder data (Requirement 4) – via TLS.
  * Access control to data (Requirement 7) – limit who can see payment data (for instance, mask card numbers, and only allow last4 display).
  * Authentication and session controls (Requirement 8) – unique IDs, MFA for admin access to card data environments.
  * Regular vulnerability management (Req 6, 11) – scanning and pen tests, etc. (This is more operational but must be planned).
  * The system design and processes should facilitate passing PCI audits. If possible, delegate as much as possible to gateway (so that we qualify for SAQ A or A-EP type compliance since card data is tokenized by gateway).
* **GDPR and Privacy Compliance:** (Detailed in the GDPR section) – from a security standpoint:

  * Implement data **privacy by design** – only collect necessary personal data, and allow its removal or anonymization.
  * **Right to erasure:** When triggered, the system must securely delete or anonymize personal data of a data subject. This should be done thoroughly (remove from main DB, ensure any backups or logs are handled per policy).
  * **Access and Rectification:** Only authorized personnel can view/modify personal data; customers can view their own data via portal.
  * **Audit of personal data access:** Log whenever an admin views or exports large sets of personal data, to have an audit trail (helps demonstrate compliance and track misuse).
  * The system should also allow extraction of all personal data on an individual easily (for data portability requests).
  * Ensure **data retention policies** can be implemented (e.g., automatically purge certain data after X years if required).
* **Secure Development Practices:**

  * The platform should be developed following OWASP best practices. Protect against common web vulnerabilities:

    * **SQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries/ORM to avoid injection entirely. All data access layers must be built to not trust user input.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Properly encode output in the UI, especially any fields that contain user-provided data (like customer names, etc.). Use templating that auto-escapes or carefully validate input.
    * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Use CSRF tokens for state-changing POST requests in the web app to ensure requests are genuine.
    * **Broken Authentication:** Use secure password storage as mentioned, implement 2FA for admins, and protect login endpoints (throttle login attempts to prevent brute force, possibly captcha after many attempts).
    * **Sensitive Data Exposure:** As above, encrypt and don’t expose sensitive info via APIs or logs. Mask things like credit card numbers (display only last4 and maybe card brand, never show full number or CVV anywhere).
    * **Access control flaws:** Ensure every API endpoint and page enforces authorization (no one can access someone else’s data by changing an ID in the URL, etc.). Conduct role testing to ensure there's no privilege escalation.
    * **Audit code with static analysis** to catch any obvious vulnerabilities, and have peer code reviews focusing on security.
  * **Dependency Management:** Keep all third-party libraries and frameworks up to date with security patches. Monitor for any known vulnerabilities (using tools or services) and patch promptly.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**

  * Implement comprehensive logging of security-relevant events:

    * Admin logins (successful and failed).
    * Changes to critical configurations.
    * Access to payment info or exports of customer lists.
    * All financial transactions (though this is also business logging).
  * Ensure logs do not contain sensitive data (no full credit card numbers, no passwords). Mask or exclude such data in logs.
  * Secure log storage (so that compromising the app doesn’t allow an attacker to erase logs easily). Consider write-once or external log collection (like send to a centralized log server or cloud logging service with append-only capability).
  * Set up monitoring/alerts for suspicious activities:

    * Multiple failed login attempts (possible brute force).
    * Sudden surge in certain actions (like mass data export).
    * Anomalous usage patterns by an admin (e.g., an admin downloading all customer data at 2 AM might raise a flag).
    * Integrate with SIEM solutions if used by the company to correlate events.
  * The system should also have **intrusion detection** mechanisms where possible. Perhaps integrate with Web Application Firewall (WAF) if deployed on cloud, to automatically block common attack patterns.
* **Data Isolation:** Ensure that different clients’ data is isolated (if multi-tenant). In our context, if the platform serves multiple companies, one company should never access another’s data. But if it's single-tenant deployment for one company’s customers, isolation is internal (just obey access control).

  * At the data level, enforce filters by tenant if multi-tenant (maybe each data row tagged by tenant ID and queries scoped).
* **Backup and Recovery:**

  * Regularly back up data (especially critical customer and financial data). Encryption of backups is a must (so an attacker obtaining a backup file cannot read plain data).
  * Have a tested disaster recovery plan to restore data from backups in case of data loss. This plan should ensure minimal data loss (maybe daily backups or better plus binlog shipping for near-real-time).
  * Secure access to backups (limit who can download, and require strong authentication).
* **Server and Network Security:**

  * Host the application on secure, patched servers. Use firewalls to restrict access (e.g., only allow necessary ports like 443, and database only accessible by app server, etc.).
  * Use network segmentation if needed to separate the database (cardholder environment) from other networks.
  * If on cloud (AWS/Azure/etc.), use security groups, proper IAM roles, and follow cloud security best practices.
  * All admin access to servers (if needed) should be via secure channels (SSH with keys, etc.), but in modern devOps possibly no one logs into servers, we use orchestration.
  * Possibly obtain security certifications (like SOC 2) which would impose a set of controls – ensure the design can accommodate those (like audit trails, etc., many of which we have).
* **Third-Party Integrations Security:**

  * Vet and use secure methods for all third-party API calls. E.g., ensure we store API credentials for gateways securely (encrypted in config or key vault) and not expose them.
  * Use least privilege for API keys (if gateway allows scoping keys, use ones that only allow needed actions).
  * Handle errors from external APIs gracefully (don’t crash and don’t expose internal stack traces or secrets in error messages).
* **Penetration Testing:** It is advisable that regular pen tests are done on the platform by an external security team. The platform should be designed to withstand such tests and quick to remediate any findings.
* **Privacy by Design:** As an overarching principle, beyond GDPR compliance, incorporate privacy considerations:

  * Minimize data collection (don’t ask for info that’s not needed for subscription management).
  * Pseudonymize data where appropriate (e.g., if using production data in testing, ensure names/emails can be anonymized).
  * Provide features like **export of personal data** to user (for transparency).
  * Ensure that when sharing data with third parties (like sending to an email service for notifications) we are not oversharing (only necessary fields).
* **Secure Configuration:** The system should run with secure settings by default:

  * e.g., ensure default admin password is changed, sample/test accounts are removed in production.
  * Turn off any debug modes in production to prevent verbose error leaks.
  * Use secure cipher suites for TLS, etc., as configured on the server.
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Use monitoring for server health and potential security events. Possibly integrate an IDS/IPS. Also, track performance anomalies that could indicate something like a DoS attack (and have mitigations like rate limiting or scaling).
* **Data Separation:** If multi-tenant (multiple B2B clients’ data in one instance), as per \[45], multi-tenant systems need strict separation so one client’s data cannot be accessed by another. Achieve this at application layer and potentially at database level (some multi-tenant solutions use separate schemas or databases per tenant, which can enhance isolation; if so, ensure keys and memory are separate for each).
* **Compliance Audits:** Be prepared for audits (PCI DSS audit, GDPR compliance checks, etc.). Maintain documentation of security controls and evidence (like access logs, policy docs). Though not a system feature per se, the system should have the capabilities (logging, reporting) to support these audits. For example, for PCI, proving that card data is encrypted at rest, and showing logs of who accessed payment settings.

In short, the platform should be **secure by design and by default**, with multiple layers of defense. It must protect the confidentiality and integrity of customer data and the availability of the service. By following industry standards and regulatory requirements, we aim to prevent breaches which could have severe financial and reputational consequences. Security is not a one-time setup but an ongoing commitment: the system will be built to allow updates and patches to be applied swiftly as new threats emerge, and all processes around it will treat security as a continuous priority.

### Compliance (Regulatory and Standards)

In addition to GDPR and PCI (covered above), there are other compliance and quality standards the platform and organization should adhere to:

* **GDPR Compliance:** (Recap key points)

  * Provide features enabling the **rights of data subjects**: right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and objection. This means:

    * Ability to extract all of a user’s personal data in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV) easily to fulfill a Subject Access Request.
    * Ability to delete or anonymize a user’s personal data on request (except data that must be retained for legal reasons). As noted, when a deletion request is fulfilled, do so within the 1 month time frame required.
    * Get explicit consent for processing where required (for example, if we ever use their data for marketing beyond necessary service emails, ensure an opt-in).
    * Provide notice of data processing in privacy policy and possibly at account creation (ensuring transparency).
  * Implement **Privacy by Design** and default: ensure we are only using personal data in ways necessary for the service, and default settings are privacy-friendly (e.g., don’t share data publicly unless opted).
  * Possibly appoint/contact a Data Protection Officer (process outside system scope) and maintain records of processing activities (we can output logs if needed).
  * Handle data transfers: if any personal data is stored or transferred outside the EU (for EU customers), use appropriate safeguards (like standard contractual clauses, etc.). If hosting is in EU for EU data, note that.
* **Other Data Protection Laws:** Comply with similar regulations in other jurisdictions:

  * **CCPA/CPRA (California):** Many GDPR principles overlap. Ensure we can handle “Do Not Sell My Info” (though we likely do not sell data) and deletion requests similarly. Also provide California residents with easy cancellation (the law requiring a “Do not obstruct cancellation online” – our cancellation flow respects that by offering easy cancel option).
  * **HIPAA (Health data)** – likely not applicable unless we store health info, which we do not. If the platform were used by a healthcare SaaS, then we’d need additional safeguards (encryption, BAA, etc.).
  * **SOC 2** (Service Organization Control 2) – While SOC 2 is an auditing standard rather than law, achieving SOC 2 Type II compliance is often desired by B2B SaaS. The platform’s design should facilitate controls under the Trust Service Criteria (Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, Privacy). Many requirements are already covered under security and availability sections (e.g., access controls, monitoring, incident response). The platform should be able to produce evidence (logs, etc.) that these controls are in place.
  * **ISO 27001** – similar to SOC2, if the company pursues it, the platform and dev process should align with its controls (asset management, access, crypto, operations security, etc.). This doesn’t change software features much but requires discipline in implementation.
* **Audit & Logging Compliance:** Ensure logs meet compliance needs:

  * PCI requires logging access to card data (we have limited card data though).
  * GDPR encourages logging of data access for accountability.
  * SOX (for public companies) might require controls on financial systems – if any part of revenue recognition is done here, ensure an audit trail of changes to financial records is present (e.g., if an invoice amount is modified or canceled, record who did it).
  * Keep logs for a defined period as required by law or policy (for instance, financial transaction logs maybe 7+ years for tax/regulatory reasons).
* **Financial Compliance:**

  * If the platform handles revenue, ensure compliance with revenue recognition rules (ASC 606 / IFRS 15). This is more on the process side, but the system should allow capturing when revenue is earned vs deferred. Possibly we integrate or export to an accounting system which handles it, but if not, at least ensure data needed is present (like schedule of service delivery for each invoice).
  * For example, if someone pays annually, 11 months of that payment is deferred revenue initially. The system’s data can be used to calculate that monthly. Some subscription platforms have built-in revenue recognition modules – if needed we might implement or integrate one.
* **Tax Compliance:**

  * Support compliance with tax laws in various jurisdictions: for example:

    * Maintain and apply correct sales tax/VAT rules for each transaction (likely via integration with a tax engine or by setting fixed tax rates per region).
    * Provide tax invoices that meet local requirements (some countries require specific invoice formats or info like VAT breakdown, company registration numbers, etc.).
    * Ability to generate reports of taxes collected by jurisdiction to aid in filing tax returns.
    * If needed, handle EU VAT OSS rules (for digital services, charge VAT of customer’s country if not business, etc.). Possibly out-of-scope initially or handled by tax service.
    * Respect tax exemptions for certain customers (like if a non-profit or a reseller who gave a certificate).
  * The platform should be flexible enough to incorporate new tax rules (e.g., new digital service taxes) relatively easily via configuration or updates.
* **E-Signature or Electronic Records:** If the platform sends agreements or order confirmations that might serve as contracts, ensure they comply with e-signature laws (ESIGN Act, etc.) if applicable. Not likely in our scope directly, except maybe storing acceptance timestamps.
* **Legal Hold:** If a company faces litigation, they may issue a legal hold on data deletion. The system should have an override to prevent certain data from deletion if needed (so if a GDPR deletion request comes but there’s a legal reason to keep data, an admin should be able to flag that account to exclude from deletion until resolved).
* **Accessibility Compliance:** While not a “regulation” in same sense, complying with accessibility standards (like **WCAG 2.1 AA**) is important (and often legally required for government or certain sectors). The UI/UX requirements should ensure visually impaired or other disabled users can use the portal:

  * Use proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, sufficient color contrast, etc. This is a non-functional UI quality requirement.
  * Ensure any PDFs generated (invoices) are also accessible or have text-based content.
* **Localization/I18n:** If the platform will operate in multiple countries/languages, ensure it supports localization of UI text, date formats, number formats, etc. Compliance in terms of language – e.g., in Quebec, consumer-facing interfaces must be in French by law. So our customer portal might need translation capabilities.

  * Also localize privacy and terms content (the user should see notices in their language).
* **Redundancy and Data Residency:** Some clients or regulations might require data to be stored in certain regions (data residency). Our architecture should be flexible enough to deploy in different regions or segregate data if needed. For instance, EU customer data stays in EU data center.
* **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:** Although an operational concern, from compliance perspective, many standards (like SOC2, ISO27001) require having DR/BCP. Our platform architecture (backups, multi-AZ deployment) should support RTO/RPO goals (Recovery Time and Point Objectives). E.g., if data center goes down, can we recover in X hours? This might be a business policy, but platform design (like using cloud multi-region capabilities) helps meet stringent RTO (maybe <4 hours downtime in worst case scenario).
* **Maintainability and Supportability:**

  * The codebase should be maintainable to allow quick fixing of any issues that could become compliance problems. E.g., if a vulnerability is found, easy to patch.
  * Document the system sufficiently for audit and new devs (this ensures continuity – not directly compliance, but indirectly for reliability).
* **Ethical Considerations:** Not a legal compliance, but as part of non-functional goals, ensure the platform’s features are used ethically (no dark patterns in UI, especially around cancellation as that can run afoul of consumer protection laws and customer trust). The design already includes straightforward cancellation to avoid any compliance issues with consumer protection regs.
* **Quality and Reliability Standards:**

  * Possibly adhere to an internal SLA for the service if offered as SaaS. E.g., guarantee 99.9% uptime to customers. Non-functional design (like redundancy) ensures we meet that.
  * If offering as SaaS to others, need an SLA and monitoring in place.
  * Possibly get certified for quality (like ISO 9001) if needed by the business – not likely for software, more for processes.

**In essence, compliance non-functional requirements ensure that the platform not only functions well, but also conforms to all external rules and standards relevant to subscription billing and data management**. This reduces legal risk and increases trust for enterprise customers. We have built in support for **GDPR requirements (privacy rights), PCI DSS requirements (card data encryption and access control), tax compliance integration, and general security standards**, which together position the platform as an enterprise-grade solution.

All these non-functional requirements (performance, security, compliance, etc.) will be verified through a combination of testing (e.g., load tests, security audits), monitoring in production, and periodic reviews to ensure ongoing adherence as the system and regulations evolve.

## System Architecture Overview

This section provides a high-level overview of the system’s architecture, describing the major components, their interactions, and how data flows through the system. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, aligning with the requirements detailed above.

### Architectural Style and Layers

The platform follows a **multi-tier architecture** with clear separation of concerns, typically including:

* **Presentation Layer:** The user interface – comprising the web application (for admin/staff users) and the customer self-service portal. This is delivered via a web front-end (could be a single-page application or server-rendered pages, or a mix). It communicates with the application layer through secure web requests (HTTPS).
* **Application/Service Layer:** The back-end application logic, which runs on one or more server instances. This layer contains modules or services corresponding to core domains: Subscription Management, Billing/Payments, Customer Accounts, Analytics/Reporting, etc. It exposes a set of **APIs** that the front-end uses and that external systems can integrate with.
* **Database/Data Layer:** Central data storage, primarily a relational database for transactional data (customers, subscriptions, invoices, payments). There may be additional data stores: e.g., a separate analytics database or data warehouse for reporting (to offload heavy read queries), a caching system (like Redis) for performance, and perhaps file storage for documents (contracts, invoice PDFs).
* **Integration Interfaces:** This includes external services and third-party integrations:

  * Payment Gateway(s) for processing payments (via their APIs).
  * Tax calculation service (if used) for computing taxes.
  * Email/Notification service for sending emails.
  * CRM/ERP systems for data sync (likely through APIs or webhooks).
  * Logging/Monitoring services for capturing logs and metrics.

Diagrammatically, one could imagine:

```
[User Browser] -- HTTPS --> [Web Server (UI + API)] -- Application Logic --> [Database]
                                     |                               \--> [Cache]
                                     |                                \-> [Search or Analytics DB]
                                     \--> [External APIs: Payment, Email, etc.]
```

*(The actual architecture is more complex, but this is a conceptual map.)*

### Components and Responsibilities

**1. Web Front-End:**
The web front-end could be built with a modern JavaScript framework or standard server-side rendering. Its main role is to present UI to users (both internal and customers) and interact with the backend via HTTP(S) requests (RESTful APIs or GraphQL). It enforces some presentation logic and client-side validation, but all critical operations are confirmed on the server. The front-end will be delivered via a web server or CDN for static assets. It will use **responsive design** to work on various devices (especially the customer portal might be used on mobile).

**2. Application Servers / API:**
The core application runs on one or multiple server processes (e.g., Node.js, Java, .NET, Python, etc., technology not fixed here). These servers:

* Host the **API endpoints** used by the front-end and external integrations. For example, endpoints for “GET /customers”, “POST /subscriptions”, “POST /invoices/{id}/pay”, etc.
* Implement business logic: when an API call comes in, the server executes the relevant logic (checking permissions, performing calculations, updating the database, calling external services).
* Are stateless (ideally), meaning any server can handle any request (user session state is kept in the database or client, not in-memory on one server). This allows horizontal scaling behind a load balancer.
* Include sub-components or modules:

  * **Authentication & Authorization Module:** manages login, token generation (if using JWT or session cookies), and checks user roles on each request.
  * **Subscription Management Module:** logic for creating plans, subscribing customers, changing plans, etc. Interacts with DB tables for subscriptions, plans, offers, and invokes billing module when needed.
  * **Billing & Invoicing Module:** handles invoice generation and scheduling, computing totals (possibly using tax service if configured), and orchestrating payment attempts by calling Payment Integration service. Also handles proration calculations as needed.
  * **Payment Integration Service:** perhaps a sub-component or library that encapsulates all calls to external payment gateways (Stripe, etc.). It stores the gateway credentials securely and provides functions like `chargeCustomer(customerId, amount)` and `refundTransaction(txnId)`. By abstracting this, we can swap gateways or use multiple. It ensures we handle responses properly and log results. It also might handle webhook callbacks from gateways (e.g., Stripe webhooks for asynchronous events like charge disputes or subscription events if we use gateway’s sub system).
  * **Customer Management Module:** CRUD for customer accounts, handle contact info updates, linking to CRM if needed. Enforces data consistency (e.g., email uniqueness if required).
  * **Reporting/Analytics Module:** Likely not heavy logic here, as many analytics computations might be done in the DB or separate process. But could handle generating summary results (or provide data to front-end which does visualization). Possibly triggers generation of CSV/PDF reports.
  * **Notification Service:** Part of app that queues up emails/notifications to send, for events like welcome emails, payment receipts, dunning notices. This may interface with an SMTP server or email API (like SendGrid). Often this is done asynchronously via a job queue to not slow main flow.
  * **Integration Handlers:** If we have webhooks from external services (payment gateways, or CRM syncing), the app provides endpoints for those and logic to process them. E.g., a `/webhook/stripe` endpoint to receive event notifications from Stripe (like payment succeeded, or chargeback filed) and update records accordingly.
  * **Background Job Scheduler:** Many tasks should run in background (e.g., sending batch emails, computing daily metrics, retrying payments). The architecture should include a job queue and worker processes for these tasks. This could be part of application server or separate processes dedicated to jobs. Using a message queue or task queue (like RabbitMQ, Celery, Sidekiq, etc.) might be employed. E.g., a nightly job at 00:00 to generate invoices for next day renewals, or an immediate job to send an email without holding up the HTTP response.
  * **API Layer** enforces throttling/rate limiting to prevent abuse (especially on public endpoints if any).

These application servers are typically deployed behind a **load balancer** so that requests are distributed and one can scale out by adding servers. The load balancer also terminates SSL (or each server can, but often LB does for simplicity and then communicates over secure network).

**3. Database:**
A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) is likely used for core data because of the complex relationships and the need for transactional integrity. Major tables (entities) include:

* `Customers`, `Contacts`
* `Subscriptions`, `Subscription_Plans`, `Plan_History`
* `Products/Services` (if we separate product from plan as in data model)
* `Offers/Promotions`
* `Invoices`, `Invoice_Line_Items` (maybe separate lines for each charge or tax, etc.)
* `Payments` (transactions logging, or combine with invoices)
* `Payment_Methods` (storing token references)
* `Audit_Logs`
* `Users` (for admin/staff accounts)
* `Roles/Permissions` mapping
* Possibly `Events` or `Notifications` table for scheduled communications.

The DB ensures referential integrity (e.g., subscription must link to a valid customer and plan). It uses transactions to ensure, say, an invoice and payment record are both saved or both not on a failure.

**Multi-Tenant Approach:** If this platform is offered as a SaaS to multiple companies, we could either have one shared database with a tenant\_id in each table (and queries always filtered by it), or separate schemas/DBs per tenant. The choice affects complexity:

* Single DB, tenant column: easier to manage one schema, but extremely important to enforce filtering (application must add `WHERE tenant_id = X` to every query to avoid data leaks).
* Separate DBs per tenant: stronger isolation (one company’s data not even stored with another’s), and easier compliance with data residency (can host their DB in region of choice). But harder to manage many DB instances and doesn't scale as nicely if there are many small tenants.
  Given we haven't definitively stated multi-tenant SaaS offering, we assume it's primarily one instance for one company’s internal use (so multi-tenant at the level of that company’s customers, which is handled naturally with customer IDs).

**4. Auxiliary Data Stores:**

* **Cache:** Likely use an in-memory cache (like Redis or Memcached) for frequently used data or expensive queries. E.g., caching the list of all active plans (which doesn’t change often) so every page load doesn’t query DB. Or caching session data or tokens. The cache should be invalidated appropriately (e.g., when plans update, clear that cache key).
* **Search Index:** If the platform needs to support very quick search across customers or invoices (especially with partial matches, etc.), integrating a search engine like Elasticsearch might be useful. For initial scope, the DB with proper indexing might suffice for queries (e.g., searching by name or email using an index). But as data grows or if advanced text search is needed, an Elasticsearch cluster could be added. The application would then update search index on relevant data changes.
* **Analytics/Data Warehouse:** For heavy analytical queries (like cohort retention, large aggregations), it may be beneficial to use a separate database or data warehouse optimized for analytics. For example, nightly ETL could copy data from the transactional DB to a star-schema data warehouse or use a read replica of the DB for running big queries so as not to impact production. This depends on scale; initially, the main DB might handle both OLTP and moderate OLAP but we keep an eye on performance. Some products integrate directly with BI tools or have internal summarization tables (like an `MRR_history` table that stores MRR per month precomputed to avoid scanning huge invoice tables each time).
* **File Storage:** If storing any binary files (contracts, invoice PDFs, export files), best to use an object storage (like AWS S3 or Azure Blob). The application would then store file references (URLs or keys) in the DB, not the file content. This separates big binary content from the main DB to keep it lean. For instance, when generating a PDF invoice, upload to S3 and store the link. Ensure the storage is secure (authenticated access, or generate temporary download links for customers).

**5. External Integrations (detailed in API section too):**

* **Payment Gateway:** The system will interact with one or multiple payment gateways through their API. Typically a small library or module handles the specifics. This component must securely store API credentials (possibly in config files not in code, and not accessible to front-end). All calls to the gateway should handle network issues gracefully (with retries if safe to do so, or error reporting). Also handle idempotency – e.g., if a network issue happens after charging but before response received, the system should be able to confirm if charge went through to avoid double-charging (some gateways have idempotent keys or the system can check via transaction query).
* **Email/SMS Service:** For sending notifications. Could simply use SMTP for email, but using a service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.) allows better delivery tracking and compliance (like easy unsubscribe management for marketing emails, though most of our emails are transactional which are exempt from some unsubscribe rules). The architecture should treat email sending as an asynchronous task; the app just posts a message to the email service’s API or places a job on a queue to send later.
* **Tax Engine:** If integrated (e.g., Avalara), the architecture has a connector that given an invoice detail (customer location, product tax category, amount) calls out to Avalara API to get tax amounts and maybe even file transactions. This happens typically at invoice creation time. Alternatively, a simpler approach if not using such a service is to have a local tax rules table or no tax at all (depending on initial scope).
* **CRM/ERP Integration:** We might expose webhooks or have scheduled sync jobs to push data to CRM. Perhaps whenever a subscription is created or changes, send a webhook or call CRM API to update that account’s info (like update renewal date, etc.). Conversely, if sales closes a deal in CRM, they might call our API to create the subscription (depending on workflow).

  * The architecture thus includes **Webhook endpoints**: e.g., a module to handle incoming webhooks like Payment events, and **Webhook emitters**: code that sends out events to subscribers (like a configured URL for CRM).
* **Logging/Monitoring Systems:** The architecture should integrate with monitoring for infrastructure (like CloudWatch, DataDog for server metrics) and application performance (APM tools). It may also push logs to a SIEM or logging service. This integration is more devops but can involve adding an agent or using an API to send logs.

**6. Infrastructure & Deployment:**

* The system likely runs on a cloud platform or on-prem servers. Key components:

  * **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming requests to application server instances, provides SSL termination and potentially WAF features.
  * **Application Servers:** Could be containerized (Docker + orchestrated by Kubernetes, for example) or deployed on VMs. Containerization fosters portability and easier scaling (just spin more containers when load rises). Also can isolate services if we break into microservices.
  * **Database Server:** Perhaps a managed relational DB service (for ease of maintenance). Possibly with a standby replica for failover and maybe a read-replica for running heavy read queries or backups.
  * **Cache Server:** e.g., Redis (managed or on a VM).
  * **Object Storage:** e.g., S3 (just an external service).
  * **Job Queue/Broker:** if using something like RabbitMQ or Redis as a broker for background tasks, that component is part of infra.
  * **Firewall/Security Groups:** Limit network traffic appropriately (only LB can talk to app servers on port 80/443, only app servers can talk to DB on its port, etc.)
  * The architecture should also consider where the customer portal is hosted – likely the same app serves both admin and portal (just different views and auth levels), but if needed could separate them (e.g., a separate portal server cluster vs admin cluster, depending on scale).
* The solution should be **containerized and orchestrated** for easier continuous deployment. This also aids in environment parity (dev, stage, prod).
* If a microservices approach is taken, each service (billing, analytics, etc.) could be separate containers with a lightweight API. Initially, likely a monolithic service for simplicity, but modular in code to allow splitting later.

**7. Data Flows:**

* **Sign-up/New Subscription Flow:**

  1. Admin (or via API from CRM) enters new subscription for a customer. The request hits the Application Server’s Subscription module.
  2. It creates subscription record in DB, possibly triggers immediate payment (if starting now with proration or immediate charge) via Payment service -> Payment Gateway.
  3. Payment gateway responds, Payment module records a Payment record linked to invoice or subscription.
  4. Subscription module generates an invoice record in DB. If payment successful, marks it paid.
  5. Notification module queues a welcome email and payment receipt email.
  6. Customer can now access service. Integration may send event to external product to provision service.
* **Recurring Billing Flow (Auto):**

  1. A scheduled job (via Cron or task scheduler in app) runs daily at e.g. midnight. It finds all subscriptions due for renewal that day (and not already processed).
  2. For each, Billing module creates an invoice, calculates charges (calls Tax service if needed for tax lines), and then calls Payment service to charge saved method.
  3. Payment success => mark invoice paid; failure => mark invoice due and trigger Dunning process.
  4. Log results; send notifications accordingly.
  5. Update subscription next due date (if auto renew continues).
* **Manual Payment Flow:**

  1. Invoice is generated and emailed. Customer pays externally (outside system).
  2. An admin goes to the invoice in admin UI and hits "Record Payment". The request goes to Payment module (though no gateway call needed if it's external, just recording).
  3. Payment record is saved, invoice marked paid. Possibly triggers an email confirmation to customer that payment was received.
  4. Or if integrated with bank, maybe a script or file import could mark multiple invoices as paid automatically (which the system should support via an import tool or API).
* **Plan Upgrade Flow:**

  1. Customer or admin requests an upgrade through UI. The request goes to Subscription module, which finds the subscription and new plan details.
  2. It calculates proration (maybe calls a proration helper library or module).
  3. It creates an invoice for the prorated difference (if charging immediately) or schedules it.
  4. Charges the payment (via Payment module).
  5. Updates subscription record: current plan = new plan, note the date/time of change. Writes a plan history entry.
  6. If needed, triggers any provisioning changes (maybe notify another system that user now has more features).
  7. Sends confirmation email of the change.
* **Data Access Control in Architecture:**

  * Each API call goes through an auth middleware that identifies the user (session or token) and checks their role.
  * The service layer methods then enforce any object-level permissions (e.g., a support agent can only view customers of their assigned region, if such granular control exists).
  * Multi-tenant check: if multiple companies use, an auth token includes tenant context and every DB query is filtered (e.g., using an ORM that auto-filters by tenant id, or including a WHERE clause).
* **Monitoring and Failover:**

  * The system runs health checks (LB pings each app instance at `/health` endpoint which checks DB connectivity, etc.).
  * If an instance or DB node fails, alerts go out (e.g., to on-call engineer). The architecture should be resilient: redundant app servers mean one fewer can carry load until replaced; DB failover node can become primary if main fails (with slight downtime).
  * Use auto-scaling: possibly spin up more app servers when CPU or request count is high, downscale when low usage to save cost (depending on environment).

**High-Level Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture Note:**
If indeed this platform is offered to multiple vendor clients (like a Chargebee/Zuora competitor scenario), then:

* The **Control Plane vs Data Plane** concept might apply:

  * A Control Plane managing tenant onboarding, user management across tenants, and maybe providing global admin UI for us (the provider).
  * A Data/Application Plane where each tenant’s subscription data and operations occur, possibly isolated.
  * But that level might be beyond our immediate scope. It's mentioned to demonstrate we considered it in design possibilities, since Cloud multi-tenant models often have that separation (shared app and DB with logical separation).

Given likely this is an internal tool for one company’s B2B SaaS, a single-tenant deployment is assumed for now (with ability to on-board multiple of their customers, which is standard).

In summary, the architecture is designed around a **modular monolithic core (or microservices if needed), backed by a robust relational database, and integrated with crucial external services** like payment gateways. It leverages standard enterprise architecture patterns:

* Load-balanced stateless app servers for **scalability**,
* A secure central database for **consistency**,
* Caching and background workers for **performance**,
* Careful integration points for **extensibility**,
* Emphasis on **security** and **isolation** of data between different contexts.

This architecture will fulfill the system requirements by ensuring that each functional area (plans, billing, customer data, etc.) has a dedicated component and that they work together in a loosely-coupled way. It is consistent with typical SaaS subscription platform architectures and provides a solid foundation for implementing the detailed requirements outlined.

## UI/UX Requirements and Mockup Descriptions

The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the platform are critical to its adoption and effectiveness. The platform will present two primary interfaces: an **Admin Portal** for internal users (product managers, billing specialists, support agents, etc.) and a **Customer Self-Service Portal** for end customers to manage their own subscriptions. Both interfaces should be intuitive, clear, and aligned with modern UX best practices.

Key principles for UI/UX design include:

* **Clarity and Hierarchy:** Information should be organized logically with clear headings, sections, and visual cues so that users can easily navigate and understand content.
* **Simplicity and Familiarity:** Use standard UI patterns (tables, forms, tabs, modals) that users expect, minimizing the learning curve. Essential actions should be readily accessible without unnecessary clicks.
* **Feedback and Transparency:** The UI should provide immediate feedback on actions (e.g., success or error messages) and make pricing, billing, and subscription details transparently visible to avoid confusion.
* **Ease of modifications:** Customers and admins should be able# B2B SaaS Subscription Management Platform – Software Requirements Specification

## Executive Summary

With the rise of the subscription economy, businesses require a robust platform to manage recurring revenue streams and customer subscriptions. SaaS adoption continues to accelerate – the global subscription and billing management market is forecast to grow from **\$4.0 billion in 2020 to \$7.8 billion by 2025**, driven by an increase in subscription business models, the need to improve customer retention and reduce churn, and compliance with evolving regulations. A subscription management platform has become an essential component for SaaS companies, encompassing the entire customer lifecycle from initial sign-up to cancellation.

This document defines the Software Requirements Specification for a **B2B SaaS Subscription Management Platform**. It outlines a comprehensive set of features and specifications aimed at enabling product managers and development teams to build a platform that allows businesses to **define flexible subscription plans**, **manage pricing (including discounts and promotions)**, **handle the full subscription lifecycle** (renewals, upgrades, downgrades, pauses, cancellations), **identify upsell and cross-sell opportunities**, and **securely manage customer data and payments**. Emphasis is placed on delivering an intuitive UI/UX for both administrators and end-users, ensuring GDPR and regulatory compliance, and providing a scalable, high-performance architecture. Each section of this document provides detailed requirements – from functional capabilities like plan configuration, billing, and analytics, to non-functional needs such as security, performance, and compliance. The goal is to offer a clear blueprint for a subscription management solution that improves operational efficiency, enhances customer satisfaction, and supports strategic business objectives.

## Product Scope and Objectives

### Scope

The platform will support end-to-end subscription management for B2B SaaS, covering the following core capabilities:

* **Subscription Plan Management:** Define and manage **subscription plans** for various offerings – including software services, digital products, and physical product subscriptions. Admin users can create plans with tiered feature options, different billing frequencies (monthly, annual, multi-year), and plan metadata (descriptions, active status, etc.). The system will support multiple products and plan tiers for each product (e.g., Basic, Pro, Enterprise), enabling a flexible catalog of offerings.
* **Pricing and Promotions:** Manage pricing for subscription packages, including base recurring prices and support for **promotional pricing** (discounts, coupon codes, free trials, introductory rates). Admins can configure time-limited offers with percentage or fixed discounts and set the duration those discounts apply (e.g., first 3 months at 50% off). The platform will automatically apply and expire promotions as configured. It will also calculate proration for mid-cycle plan changes so customers are charged fairly when upgrading or downgrading. Tax handling is integrated – the system can send data to a tax engine to calculate sales tax/VAT so that billing complies with local tax requirements.
* **Custom Plans and Bundles:** Allow creation of **custom subscription plans** for specific enterprise customers and **bundled offerings** that package multiple products/services into one subscription. For example, admins can bundle Product A + Product B at a special combined price, or set up a custom plan with bespoke pricing for a particular client. The platform will track bundle components internally (so usage can be managed per component) while presenting it as a single subscription to the customer. Multi-year contract arrangements are supported – subscriptions can have a committed term (e.g., 2-year contract) with locked-in pricing or term-based discounts (e.g., 10% off for 3-year commitment). The system will record contract start/end dates and enforce terms (preventing mid-term cancellation unless via override).
* **Sales and Revenue Metrics Tracking:** Continuously track key **subscription metrics**: number of active subscriptions, new subscriptions, cancellations, upgrades/downgrades, MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), ARR, churn rate, customer lifetime value, etc. These metrics are derived from subscription and billing data and provide insight into business performance. For example, the platform will compute MRR and churn automatically and make these available in dashboards and reports. This data collection underpins the Reporting and Analytics features described later.
* **Subscription Lifecycle Management:** Manage the full lifecycle of subscriptions, including **automated renewals**, cancellation processing, upgrades/downgrades, and the ability to pause and resume subscriptions. The system will auto-generate invoices and attempt charges at renewal, handle payment failures with retry (dunning) logic, and update subscription status accordingly. Admins (or customers, via portal) can change plans mid-cycle – the system will prorate charges for immediate upgrades or schedule downgrades for the next cycle. Cancellations can be immediate or at period end, with the platform capturing cancellation reasons and enforcing any notice periods. A **pause** feature allows temporary suspension of a subscription (stopping billing for a defined period) with resumption later.
* **Upsell and Cross-Sell Management:** Tools to help identify and act on **upsell** (upgrade to higher tier) and **cross-sell** (add new product subscriptions) opportunities among existing customers. The platform can flag, for example, customers who consistently hit usage limits as candidates for an upgrade, or customers who own Product X but not Product Y as cross-sell targets. Admin users will have views/reports highlighting these opportunities and may trigger promotional offers or outreach. The system supports simple execution of upsells (one-click upgrade of plan) and cross-sells (adding an additional subscription under the same account), with associated billing handled seamlessly. (Note: Full CRM-like opportunity tracking is out of scope, but data and basic tools are provided to integrate with sales processes).
* **Customer Account Management and Billing Info:** Store and manage **customer information**, including company details, contacts, billing and shipping addresses, and payment methods. The platform will maintain a history of each customer’s subscriptions, invoices, and payments, providing a 360° view of their account. Sensitive data like payment details will be stored securely (e.g., credit card data is tokenized and not stored in plain form). The system supports multiple payment methods per customer (e.g., a primary card and backup card or bank account) and allows setting preferred payment method and billing preferences (such as consolidated invoicing for multiple subscriptions). All customer data management will comply with GDPR and privacy requirements (with features to export or delete personal data on request).
* **Payments and Billing:** Accommodate automatic and manual payments from various methods. This includes **automated credit card charges** for recurring payments (with PCI-compliant handling of card data), as well as integration for ACH/Direct Debit and digital wallets like PayPal. If customers pay via invoice (manual payments), the system will support generating PDF invoices and tracking payment status (with admins marking invoices as paid when a check or bank transfer is received). It will implement configurable **dunning processes** for failed payments – e.g., retrying a failed card after a few days and sending collection emails during a grace period. Payment gateway integration is a core aspect (detailed in a later section), ensuring that the platform can securely process payments and handle refunds, partial payments, and payment receipts issuance.

**Out of Scope:** The platform does not handle the internal delivery of the product itself (e.g., software license enforcement or content delivery); it focuses on the subscription commerce aspects. Inventory management and fulfillment logistics for physical goods are out of scope (though the system can integrate with such systems by providing subscription data like SKU and frequency). General CRM functionalities such as lead management or sales pipeline tracking are not included (the platform assumes customers are already acquired; it manages them post-acquisition, though it will integrate with CRM for data sync if needed). The platform is not a general accounting system – it will provide revenue data and invoicing, but detailed accounting journal entries or AR ledger management may be handled in an external accounting system (with which this platform will integrate via exports or APIs). Any compliance beyond subscriptions (e.g., HR data, etc.) is not covered except as related to subscription billing.

### Objectives

Key objectives of the platform include:

* **Automate and Streamline Operations:** Eliminate time-consuming manual processes in subscription management by automating billing, invoicing, and renewals. This reduces errors and ensures customers are billed accurately and on time. By taking the drudgery out of tracking invoices and payments, the platform frees up teams to focus on growth and customer service.
* **Increase Revenue Retention and Growth:** Provide tools to **reduce churn and maximize revenue** from the existing customer base. This includes automated dunning to recover failed payments (reducing involuntary churn), and upsell prompts to move customers to higher plans or cross-sell additional products, thereby increasing average revenue per customer. Existing customers have already crossed the trust threshold, so successfully upselling and cross-selling them can significantly boost revenue.
* **Improve Customer Experience:** Ensure that end users have control and transparency over their subscriptions. The self-service portal should make it easy to manage their plans, view billing history, update payment methods, and even cancel if they choose, with minimal friction. A smooth user experience (e.g., clear pricing display, easy plan modification) builds trust and satisfaction, which in turn improves retention. Today’s customers want empowerment through an easy-to-use portal with real-time access to their account information.
* **Enhance Flexibility and Customization:** Enable the business to support a wide variety of subscription models and customer deals. The platform should be flexible enough to launch new pricing models or packages without engineering effort – e.g., support one-time setup fees, usage-based add-ons in the future, or custom multi-year pricing. This ensures that the company can respond quickly to market demands and tailor offerings to enterprise clients, giving a competitive edge.
* **Ensure Data Security and Compliance:** Protect sensitive customer and payment data through strong security practices (encryption, role-based access, audit logs) and maintain compliance with regulations like GDPR for personal data and PCI DSS for payment data. This not only avoids legal penalties but also maintains customer trust that their data is safe. For instance, cardholder data will be encrypted in transit and at rest per PCI Requirement 3.4, and personal data will be accessible only to authorized roles on a need-to-know basis.
* **Provide Actionable Insights:** Through reporting and dashboards, give product managers and finance teams visibility into subscription metrics and customer behavior. By having granular data and business intelligence (e.g., the ability to slice and analyze revenue by product or cohort), the business can make informed decisions to improve monetization. The goal is to turn raw billing data into strategic insight (e.g., identify that churn is high on a particular plan or that a promotion significantly increased conversions).
* **High Reliability and Scalability:** The platform is mission-critical, so it must be performant and reliable. Design objectives include achieving high uptime (e.g., 99.9% or above) and the ability to scale to accommodate growth (more customers, more subscriptions) without major redesign. This objective ensures continuity of service as the business scales and gives confidence to enterprise clients who may inquire about the platform’s capacity and SLAs.

By meeting these objectives, the platform will serve as a backbone for the company’s subscription business – **automating quote-to-cash processes, improving financial predictability, and enhancing the customer’s journey**. It will allow the organization to innovate in their subscription offerings and pricing with ease, while safeguarding revenue through intelligent retention features and robust compliance.

## Functional Requirements

### Subscription Plan Management

The platform shall provide comprehensive tools for administrators to create and manage subscription plans. This includes configuring plans for different product offerings and updating plan details over time.

* **Plan Creation and Catalog:** Authorized users (product managers or billing admins) can create new **subscription plans** via an admin UI. For each plan, the admin can specify:

  * **Product/Service Association:** The product or service the plan is for (e.g., “Analytics Software” or “Monthly Snack Box”). Plans can be grouped by product. The system supports multiple products, each with their own set of plans.
  * **Plan Name and Description:** A human-friendly name (e.g., “Basic”, “Pro”, “Enterprise”) and a description of features or entitlements. Together with the associated product, the plan name should be unique.
  * **Features and Limits:** Define what is included in the plan – e.g., feature flags, usage limits (like number of users, projects, API calls), support level, delivery frequency for physical goods, etc. The platform should allow listing key features or linking to a more detailed spec. (Implementation could be a list of feature toggles or an “options” sub-list; for example, a plan might include Option A and B as stored in an `option_included` table).
  * **Billing Frequency Options:** Which billing periods are allowed for this plan. Common options: monthly, yearly, multi-year. The admin could create separate plan entries for each term or a single plan with multiple billing options. For clarity, we may model monthly vs annual as separate SKU/variants of the same base plan. The system must support annual pricing that is not just 12×monthly (many businesses offer a discount for annual prepay).
  * **Base Price:** The default price for the plan per billing period (e.g., \$100 per month, or \$1,000 per year). If multiple currencies are supported, allow setting price per currency. The system shall store numeric price values with currency code. It should also handle any initial setup fee if applicable (some plans might have one-time fees).
  * **Status (Active/Inactive):** A flag to mark if the plan is currently available for sale. Inactive plans cannot be selected for new subscriptions. This allows retiring plans while grandfathering existing subscribers. Each plan record will have an *active* boolean and possibly a sunset date. Only active plans appear in customer-facing listings.
  * **Custom Fields:** (Optional) The admin can tag plans with additional metadata (e.g., an internal SKU code, segment, or eligibility criteria like “Enterprise-only”). These can be used for integration or filtering.
* **Plan Hierarchy and Upgrades:** The platform should understand relationships between plans for upgrade/downgrade logic. Admins might mark certain plans as upgrade/downgrade paths of others (like Basic -> Pro -> Enterprise). Alternatively, the system can infer it by plan tiers. This ensures the UI only presents valid upgrade options to users. (For instance, if a customer is on Pro, the UI might suggest Enterprise as an upgrade and Basic as a downgrade, not unrelated plans for a different product.)
* **Plan Listing and Search:** The admin UI will list all plans in a tabular format with key info (name, product, price(s), status). Admins can search or filter by product or status to find plans. This interface should clearly show if a plan is active and if any promotions are currently attached.
* **Editing Plans:** Admins can modify plan details. Some fields (like price) if changed will affect new subscriptions and optionally existing ones if specified. Price changes do not retroactively affect already-paid periods, but the new rate applies on next renewal unless overridden by a custom contract. The system will log changes to plan definitions (for audit). If a plan name or features change, existing subscribers may need notification (outside scope of automatic, but admin could email via campaign).
* **Versioning Considerations:** To ensure historical accuracy, the system should either:

  * Keep an effective date for price changes (so invoices generated before a certain date use old price, after use new price).
  * Or create a new plan entry if the change is significant (like “Pro Plan 2024”) and mark old one inactive. This may be left to admin discretion or automated if we want to preserve legacy plan info.
* **Feature and Option Management:** There may be a library of features that can be toggled per plan (like “Premium Support: yes/no”). The system can have an **Option dictionary** and an **Option Included** mapping table as per data model. Admins first define global options (like “White-glove Onboarding”) and then mark which plans include which options. This provides clarity on differences between plans. Removing an option from a plan in the future should not affect subscriptions already provisioned with that option unless explicitly intended (those could be handled by plan changes for subscribers).
* **Bundles:** For bundle plans that include multiple products, admins should be able to select which component plans are part of the bundle. For instance, a bundle plan “All-Access Suite” might include Product A’s Pro plan and Product B’s Standard plan under the hood. The system should record these links. Selling a bundle results in multiple provisioned services but one billing item. In the plan UI, an admin creating a bundle might pick from existing plans as components and set an overall bundle price. The platform will ensure if component plans update, bundle is reviewed (though likely bundle decouples from component pricing once set).
* **Retiring Plans:** When an admin retires a plan (sets inactive), the system should check if any active subscriptions are on it. It should allow retirement (some systems prevent if subscriptions exist, but better to allow and just not permit new ones). All existing subscribers remain on that plan (now a grandfathered plan). The system might provide tools to migrate those to a new plan if desired (bulk update function, outside MVP scope). The UI should warn if retiring a plan that still has subscribers.
* **Preview and Testing:** Perhaps allow admins to simulate how a plan will look to customers on the portal, or generate sample pricing. (This is a nice-to-have for confidence.)
* **Audit Trail:** Maintain a log of plan management actions: creation, edits, activation status changes. Log at least who did it (user id) and timestamp and what changed. This helps in compliance and debugging issues like “why did price of Plan X change on Jan 5”.
* **Plan Display to Customers:** (Though primarily an admin function, ensure that on the customer portal or order forms, plans are displayed with the correct pricing, features, and that promotional or contract pricing overrides are accounted for. That falls under UI/UX and integration, but relies on correct plan data.)
* **Example:**

  * *Creating a Plan:* An admin adds a new “Premium” plan for Product X. They enter: Name: "Premium", Product: X, Billing: Monthly and Annual, Price: \$200/month and \$2,160/year (10% annual discount), Features: "Unlimited projects, 20 users, Premium support". They mark it Active. The plan is saved and immediately appears as an option for sales and in the customer upgrade portal.
  * *Updating a Plan:* Next year, they want to increase the price to \$220/month for new customers. They edit the Premium plan, change monthly price to \$220 effective Mar 1. They leave existing subscribers grandfathered at \$200 (handled outside system or via custom pricing entries). New subscriptions from Mar 1 use \$220. The plan’s active status remains. The system logs that Admin A changed price from 200 to 220 on that date.
  * *Retiring a Plan:* They decide to discontinue the “Basic” plan. In the admin UI, they set Basic plan to Inactive on June 30. The system warns “50 customers currently on Basic. They will continue on this plan, but no new subscriptions can be started.” Admin confirms. On July 1, Basic no longer appears in any “add subscription” UI for customers or sales, though it still shows on those 50 customer accounts (tagged as inactive plan maybe). The admin later uses customer management tools to reach out and migrate those to another plan.

By providing flexible plan management features, the platform enables the business to configure and adjust their subscription offerings without code changes, supporting marketing experiments (like limited-time plans), segmentation (different plans for different customer types), and evolution of the pricing strategy over time.

### Pricing Management and Promotions

The platform shall support sophisticated pricing configurations and promotional pricing strategies to maximize sales and accommodate marketing campaigns. This includes setting standard prices, discounts, free trials, and handling proration and taxes.

* **Base Pricing Configuration:** For each subscription plan (as defined above), admins can configure the **base recurring price** for each billing frequency:

  * If a plan is offered monthly and annually, define both prices (e.g., \$100/month, \$1,080/year). The system should clearly associate these to the plan so it knows what to charge depending on the customer’s chosen term.
  * Support **multi-currency pricing** if needed: e.g., allow entering price in USD, EUR, GBP, etc. (Potentially, maintain separate plan records per currency or a pricing table keyed by plan and currency).
  * If a plan has a one-time setup fee or onboarding fee, allow adding that as an initial charge line item.
  * **Tiered/Volume Pricing:** (If in scope for usage-based aspects) For now, assume fixed price per period. In future, might need the ability to set tiered pricing (like first 100 units free, next per-unit charge). This can be handled via an add-on usage module if needed, but initial scope focuses on recurring flat fees.
* **Promotional Offers (Discounts/Coupons):** The system will include a **Promotions** module where admins can create and manage promotions such as:

  * **Coupon Codes:** Admin can generate a code (text string) that customers can enter to get a discount. When creating a coupon, specify:

    * Discount Type: either **percentage off** or **fixed amount off**.
    * Discount Value: e.g., 20% or \$50.
    * Applicable Plans: the specific plans or products the coupon can apply to (or “all plans”).
    * Applicability: whether it applies to the first payment only, first N payments, or all payments for the life of the subscription. E.g., “10% off for first 12 months” or “\$100 off one-time”.
    * Validity Period: a start and end date for the code (e.g., only valid during a campaign).
    * Usage Limits: optionally, how many times it can be used in total (e.g., first 100 customers) and/or whether it’s one per customer.
    * New vs Existing: possibly mark if code only for new sign-ups vs can existing subscriptions apply it on renewal (most coupons are at sign-up time).
  * The platform will generate an internal ID and store the coupon. The code string should be unique. When a customer or admin enters that code on an order, the system will validate and apply the corresponding discount to pricing.
  * **Automatic Promotions (No Code):** Also allow creating promotions without a code – e.g., “Winter Sale: 15% off annual plans during December” that is automatically applied in the checkout or pricing calculation. In the system, this can be configured similarly to a coupon but with no code (applies to everyone meeting criteria during time window).
  * **Free Trials:** Configurable trial periods for plans. For example, admin can set that the "Pro" plan offers a 14-day free trial for new sign-ups. The system should then not charge the customer for the first 14 days and start billing afterward unless canceled. Trial configuration might be part of plan config or promotion (some systems treat “free trial” as a kind of promotion). Key settings:

    * Trial length (days or months).
    * Whether the subscription auto-converts after trial (typically yes, auto-convert to paid).
    * If credit card is required upfront for trial (the platform will support both scenarios – often card is collected at trial start to auto-bill later).
    * One trial per customer enforcement (to prevent abuse).
  * The platform must handle the trial state: mark subscription as trial, set next billing date = today + trial length, and send reminders near trial end. If not canceled by trial end, automatically convert to active and charge the card (see lifecycle).
  * **Introductory Pricing:** The system should allow specifying an introductory rate for a limited number of billing cycles. E.g., “First 3 months for \$10, then \$30 thereafter.” This can be configured as a promotion:  **fixed price override for first N cycles** or a percentage discount for first N cycles. The subscription record needs to carry info on the promo so it knows when to switch to regular price. (This could be implemented by generating temporary discounts on the first invoices).
* **Discount Application and Stacking:**

  * By default, if multiple promotions could apply to a subscription, the platform should apply the best single promotion or a predefined combination as per business rules. Generally, **stacking multiple promotions is not allowed** to avoid extreme discounts (unless explicitly configured, e.g., a coupon code might be allowed on top of an already discounted annual price).
  * The system will need rules: e.g., if a plan already has a built-in annual discount, and the customer also has a coupon, both could apply if permitted. This should be transparent – e.g., show original price, minus annual 10% discount, minus coupon \$50, equals final price.
  * There should be an order of operations: apply plan-level or term discounts first (annual discount), then coupon on top, etc. This should be clearly documented for admins.
  * The platform should prevent conflicting promos (two different percentage discounts) from stacking inadvertently.
* **Proration for Mid-cycle Changes:** As mentioned, the platform will handle **prorated billing** for upgrades, downgrades, or cancellations mid-period:

  * When a customer **upgrades** their plan mid-cycle (say 15 days into a 30-day period), the system will calculate the unused amount of the old plan and the cost of the new plan for the remainder. For example, if they paid \$100 for the month and are halfway, roughly \$50 of old plan is “unused” and can be credited, while new plan costs \$150 for full month, half of which is \$75 for remaining half-month. Thus, charge \~\$25 immediately (75 new – 50 credit). The system should automate this math precisely (to the day or even hour, depending on proration policy).
  * Admin can configure proration policy rounding (typically daily prorate by calendar days).
  * The system will either issue a **proration invoice** for that difference amount upon upgrade or add it to next invoice as a line item credit/debit. Many prefer immediate charge for upgrades, so likely generate an immediate charge.
  * For **downgrades** effective immediately, similarly compute if a credit is due. Often downgrades are scheduled for next period end to avoid needing refunds. The platform will allow immediate downgrade with proration credit if the business chooses, or default to queue it for next cycle (admin can choose on the downgrade action).
  * **Pause proration:** If a subscription is paused partway through a cycle, either extend the current cycle by the pause duration or credit the unused time. The platform’s approach should be consistent and explained to admins. Simpler: extend end date by pause length so customer still gets full prepaid service time when resumed, thus no financial transaction on pause/resume (just schedule shift). This avoids proration in pausing.
  * Proration calculations should be clearly itemized on invoices (e.g., “Credit for 15 unused days of Basic plan: -\$50” and “Charge for 15 days of Premium plan: \$75”).
* **Tax Calculation:** The system should integrate tax calculation into pricing:

  * Mark which plans/products are taxable and their tax category (e.g., digital service vs physical goods might have different tax rules).
  * For each invoice, based on customer’s tax location (customer record has country, state, possibly VAT ID), the platform either computes tax via built-in rules or calls an external tax engine. The goal is to produce a tax line on the invoice (e.g., VAT 20% = \$20).
  * If simple initial approach: allow admin to set a tax rate per customer or region (like a default or turn on “Apply EU VAT”). However, a robust solution is using a service like Avalara or a table of jurisdictions. This is a complex domain, but at minimum, **the platform will not finalize an invoice total without adding applicable taxes** as required. It ensures compliance: always in compliance with global, regional, and local tax requirements.
  * The UI for admin should allow marking a customer as tax-exempt (and storing their exemption ID) so that no tax is charged if applicable.
  * Multi-currency ties in: tax calculations in the currency of the transaction.
* **Invoicing and Rounding:** When assembling final prices, ensure proper rounding to currency standards (e.g., cents). The platform should avoid tiny penny differences across cycles. If multiple discounts apply, do calculation in high precision then round final.
* **Displaying Savings:** On the customer-facing side, if a promotion is applied, the system should be able to show “Promotion applied: -\$X” or “You’re saving 15%” to make it transparent. This is more UI, but the pricing engine must supply the data for such display (original price vs discounted price).
* **Promotion Expiration and Renewal:** The system must automatically handle when a promotional period ends. For example, if a customer had 6 months at a discounted rate, on month 7 the system should revert to the normal price for that subscription without requiring admin intervention. Concretely, the subscription record might have a field linking it to a promotion and a count of how many cycles remain for it. Once exhausted, the billing engine no longer applies the promo. This ensures revenue isn’t inadvertently kept at a discounted rate longer than intended.
* **Custom Pricing Overrides:** For enterprise deals, admins might set a custom price for a specific customer’s subscription (different from the standard plan price). The platform should allow storing an override price at the subscription level. If present, that price is used for billing instead of the plan’s base price. (For example, ACME Corp is on “Enterprise” plan normally \$1000/mo but negotiated \$800/mo – their subscription entry would have custom\_price \$800). The system will then calculate invoices using \$800 and note that it’s a custom rate (perhaps in invoice footnote). This is crucial for flexibility. Such overrides should be visible in the admin UI (e.g., on customer account page, show “Plan: Enterprise (custom \$800/mo)”). Promotions typically would not stack on a custom price unless specifically intended (the custom price likely already includes any discount).
* **User Interface for Pricing Management:**

  * Admins should have a “Promotions” section where they can create/edit coupons and promotions. This UI will list active and upcoming promotions, with details like code, discount, validity.
  * It will also show usage statistics (e.g., 30 uses out of 100 limit used) and allow ending a promotion early if needed.
  * For each subscription in admin view, if a discount or custom price is applied, it should be clearly indicated.
  * Possibly provide a pricing simulation tool: e.g., an admin could input a scenario (plan X, annual, applying coupon Y) and the system would output the breakdown of charges to confirm promotions are set right.
* **Audit and Logging for Promotions:** Log creation/changes of promotions (who created a coupon, changed its value or validity). Also log whenever a promotion code is redeemed (so we can trace misuse or performance of promo).
* **Example Scenarios:**

  * *Limited-Time Coupon:* Marketing creates code **HOLIDAY2025**: 25% off the first 3 months, valid for any monthly plan, only during Dec 2025. The system records: for customers who sign up in that window and enter the code, their Jan/Feb/Mar bills will each have 25% off, then April will revert to full price. The code cannot be used after Dec 31, 2025. If a customer tries on Jan 2, 2026, it’s rejected as expired.
  * *Free Trial Use:* A new user signs up for Pro plan with a 14-day free trial (no immediate charge). The subscription is created with a trial\_end date. The system sends a trial confirmation. On day 13, a reminder email goes out: “Your trial ends tomorrow, you will be charged \$100 on Jan 15.” On day 15, the platform automatically creates an invoice and charges their card for the next month. If the card fails, dunning kicks in, but service might be paused if trial expired without payment. If the user canceled on day 10 via portal, the system marked subscription canceled at trial end and did not charge.
  * *Mid-cycle Upgrade with Proration:* A customer is on Basic (\$50/mo) paid up until March 31. On March 15 they upgrade to Premium (\$100/mo). The system calculates roughly half month upgrade: credit \$25 for unused Basic, charge \$50 for remaining Premium. It issues an immediate invoice for +\$25 (or adds \$25 charge to next invoice). The customer is charged and their next billing (Apr 30) will be \$100 for full Premium month. The invoice clearly shows the proration credit and charge.
  * *Annual Billing with Intro Discount:* Customer subscribes to an annual plan with “First year 50% off” promotion. The system invoices \$500 (50% of \$1000) for year 1. It also schedules that the next renewal (year 2) will be at full \$1000 (and ideally notifies maybe a month before renewal at full price). The subscription record knows the promo ends after 1 year. At renewal time, invoice is \$1000. If the customer complains not expecting increase, support can point to the initial terms. (The platform might also include the original discount note in their welcome email or invoice).

Through these pricing management features, the platform gives the business fine-grained control over monetization strategies. They can run promotions to attract new users, implement trials to increase conversion, and adjust pricing without engineering changes. The system’s automation ensures these rules are applied consistently and expire when they should, protecting revenue while providing flexibility to marketing and sales teams.

### Custom Plans, Bundles, and Multi‑Year Contracts

Many B2B subscription deals require flexibility beyond standard plans and month-to-month billing. The platform will accommodate **custom plans**, **bundle offerings**, and **multi-year contracts** to support enterprise sales and complex arrangements:

* **Customer-Specific Custom Plans:** The system shall allow setting up tailor-made subscription terms for a particular customer:

  * Admins can override the plan and pricing on a per-subscription basis (as noted under pricing). This covers most custom cases: e.g., a special price, different feature set (perhaps handled by assigning them additional features manually).
  * If needed, admins could create a hidden plan entry that’s only used for that customer (e.g., “Acme Corp Gold Plan”), but this can often be avoided by using the standard plan + custom price + extra features toggled on for that customer’s account.
  * The platform should allow notes or attachments to a subscription to record special terms (e.g., “Includes feature X as courtesy” or attach the PDF contract).
  * Custom billing cycles: If a customer wants an unusual billing schedule (say, quarterly when standard is monthly or annual), the system should support that by either treating it as a custom plan frequency or by an agreement to invoice them manually with a certain frequency. Ideally, allow selection of quarterly billing for that subscription, even if not a public option.
  * Ensure that these custom settings don’t get overwritten inadvertently (e.g., if plan defaults change, don’t affect the custom subscription).
  * **Visibility:** Mark such subscriptions clearly in UI as “Custom” so it’s understood that standard rules may not apply.
* **Bundled Offerings:** Support selling multiple products or components as one combined subscription:

  * Admins can define a **bundle plan** (as described in plan management) that includes multiple underlying plans. The platform will then handle provisioning/billing for the bundle:

    * **Provisioning:** When a bundle subscription is created, the system should create the necessary entitlements for each component product. For example, if Bundle includes Product A and B, subscribing to the bundle should trigger provisioning flows for A and B just like if they were subscribed separately. Internally, this could mean creating two linked subscription records (one for A, one for B) tied to the bundle master record. Alternatively, a single subscription record that references multiple plan IDs. Data model wise, one could have a Bundle table that lists component plans.
    * **Billing:** Bundles have a single price for the entire package (not necessarily the sum of parts – often a discounted total). The invoice should show it as one line item (optionally listing components for clarity). The platform should ensure customers aren’t double-charged for components and that if components have separate taxes or frequencies, those are normalized (likely all components follow the bundle’s billing period).
    * **Partial Changes:** If a customer wants to add or remove one component from a bundle, that effectively changes their bundle composition (which might be treated as migrating to a different plan – possibly a new bundle or separate subscriptions). The system can assist but such changes might require an admin to handle as a custom deal (the platform is not required to dynamically split bundles; that could be out of scope beyond providing the data).
    * **Constraints:** The platform should either prevent subscribing to the same product outside the bundle to avoid duplicates or at least warn the admin if they try. Also, if a user cancels a bundle, all components should be canceled together (the system should coordinate that).
  * Example: Offer a "Productivity Suite Bundle" that includes *Project Management Software* and *CRM Software* for a combined \$150/month (cheaper than \$100 + \$80 = \$180 if bought separate). The system has two underlying plans (Project Pro, CRM Pro). It defines a bundle plan linking those. Customer subscribes to Productivity Suite; the system creates a subscription that grants them both Project Pro and CRM Pro access, and bills \$150 monthly. If they cancel, both services end.
* **Multi-Year Contracts:** Many B2B customers sign agreements for 1, 2, or 3+ years for better pricing or to lock in terms. The platform will support such contracts:

  * **Term Length:** When creating a subscription or during negotiation, an admin can set a **contract term** (in number of months or an end date). For example, a 24-month contract from Jan 1, 2025 to Dec 31, 2026. The system should record this (contract\_end\_date).
  * **Pricing and Discounts:** Often multi-year deals involve a discount or fixed rate for the whole period. The system can implement this by either using a custom price for that subscription (e.g., applied a 10% discount off normal annual price for the 2-year term) or a promotion that spans multiple years. Admin might also mark that the price is fixed for the term (so even if list price increases, this subscription stays at agreed rate).
  * **Billing Frequency for Multi-Year:** Determine how the customer will be billed:

    * They might pay annually (common) or even upfront for multiple years (less common).
    * The platform should handle upfront payment: if the customer pays entire 2-year sum upfront, the system would generate one invoice for 24 months. It would then not bill again until renewal after 2 years. The subscription remains active throughout. (The system needs to properly account for revenue recognition but at least operationally it’s one charge).
    * Or handle annual payments within a multi-year commitment: the contract says they commit for 3 years, but they are invoiced yearly. In this case, the subscription renews annually but cannot be canceled until after 3 years without penalty. The platform would still generate annual invoices, but if the customer tries to cancel earlier, the UI should disallow or warn and require an override. Essentially, the contract term is a metadata that prevents normal cancellation.
  * **Renewals of Contracts:** As contract end date approaches, the system should notify admins (and optionally customers) ahead of time (e.g., 60 days) so they can renew or renegotiate. If auto-renew is part of contract, the system can be set to either:

    * Auto-renew into a new contract of the same length (maybe with updated pricing or same).
    * Convert to month-to-month after contract (some contracts lapse into monthly).
    * Or simply not auto-renew, requiring manual renewal input.
    * The platform should be flexible: perhaps an “auto\_renew” flag on the contract. If true, on contract end the system either extends the contract term or flips the subscription to a month-to-month status at perhaps current rate.
  * **Cancellation and Penalties:** During an active contract, standard practice is not to allow cancellation (or allow with penalty fees). The platform should enforce that **early cancellation is restricted**:

    * If a user attempts to cancel via portal, it should either block it (“You are on a committed term until Dec 31, 2026. Please contact support to discuss changes.”).
    * If an admin tries to cancel before term end, maybe show a warning and require entering a reason and possibly penalty handling (the system could calculate the remaining contract value as reference).
    * The system can allow an override by an admin with a high role (like a super-user can force cancel if needed, e.g., if company went bankrupt).
  * **Changes during Contract:** Often allowed upgrades (customer can upgrade and extend contract or keep same end date) but downgrades not allowed until renewal. The platform should guide this: e.g., allow adding more users or upgrading plan (maybe contract resets or not), but not downgrading service level mid-term. These nuances may be handled by policy outside system, but system should not automatically shorten contract if upgraded. Likely upgrading doesn’t change term, just price (amend contract).
  * **Contract Recording:** The platform should allow uploading the signed contract PDF to the customer’s account or linking a contract ID. Additionally, fields like contract value (Total Contract Value = MRR \* months, or if upfront, that amount) and any unique terms summary can be stored for reference.
  * **Visibility:** For accounts under contract, the UI should clearly indicate “Under contract until \[date]” both in admin and possibly customer portal (so they know).
  * **Discount Schedules:** If a multi-year contract has year-by-year different pricing (e.g., 5% price increase in year 3 or a step discount that decreases), the platform might need a way to model that. We could approximate by treating each year as its own priced period or by scheduling a price change. For simplicity, one can handle by splitting into multiple subscription periods or telling the admin to update the price at renewal. However, if it's agreed upfront that Year 2 price = X, Year 3 = Y, we should ideally schedule those. Perhaps the subscription can have a stored future price override that activates on a specific date (like an entry in plan\_history with date and new price).
  * **Example:** Beta Corp signs a 3-year deal for Premium plan. Standard is \$1000/mo, but they get 15% off for committing 3 years, and will be billed annually. In the platform, admin sets their subscription start Jan 1, 2025, end Dec 31, 2027, custom price \$850/mo (15% off \$1000) and annual billing. The system generates invoice for Jan 1, 2025 – Dec 31, 2025 = \$10,200 (850\*12) due immediately. Next invoices scheduled for Jan 1, 2026 and Jan 1, 2027 for the next years. Beta Corp cannot cancel online; an admin note says “Contract - cannot cancel early.” If they request upgrade to an even higher plan mid-term, admin can accommodate by adjusting subscription (perhaps new price and possibly extending contract). On Nov 2027, the system reminds account manager to renew. If they don’t renew and auto-renew was not set, the subscription could revert to month-to-month at then-current price starting Jan 2028 (or expire if chosen).
* **Composite Subscriptions and Hierarchies:** (Optional consideration) If the business deals with parent-child account structures (like a parent company with several subsidiaries each with subscriptions), the system should allow grouping subscriptions under a parent account for consolidated billing. This might mean one invoice for multiple subscriptions or bundling multiple customer sub-accounts under a master contract. While complex, the platform could support it by linking accounts or by using bundles concept (like selling to parent account a bundle that internally maps to sub-account subscriptions). This is advanced and might be future scope, but noting because enterprise contracts sometimes span multiple services in different departments (similar to bundles).
* **User Interface for Contracts:**

  * The customer account page for an enterprise on contract should display a summary of contract terms (length, end date, negotiated pricing, any included extras).
  * There could be a “Contract Management” tab where admin users can see all active contracts, upcoming expirations, etc., to manage renewals proactively.
  * Possibly integrate a e-signature or at least storing that contract reference number for legal audit.
* **Auditing & History:** The platform should log key events like contract start, renewal, termination. Who approved an early termination (if done) should be logged to have accountability, since these often involve financial penalties offline.
* **Notifications & Reminders:** Built-in reminders: e.g., X days before contract end, notify assigned account owner or list it in a “Contracts expiring soon” report. Also, if auto-renew is going to happen, maybe notify customer as courtesy (some jurisdictions require informing before auto-renewal kicks in).
* **Penalties/Fees:** The platform won’t automatically charge early termination fees (that’s usually handled via invoice or offline negotiation), but an admin could use the system to issue a one-time invoice for a penalty if needed. For example, create an ad-hoc invoice line “Contract termination fee” for \$Y. This is a manual step if needed.
* **Example (Bundle + Multi-Year):** ACME signs a 2-year contract for a bundle of Product A and B for 20 users each at a package price of \$2000/month, billed quarterly. The system: creates a custom bundle subscription for ACME, 24-month term, custom price \$2000/month, billing frequency quarterly. It generates an invoice every 3 months for \$6000. ACME’s subscription internally might map to provisioning 20 licenses in Product A and 20 in Product B systems. ACME can add more users beyond 20 if contract allows (maybe at extra cost per user – the system should then either create an add-on subscription or adjust price). These complexities might involve manual intervention (like amend contract).

By handling custom and long-term arrangements, the platform becomes suitable for enterprise sales, which often require non-standard terms. It balances automation with the flexibility for admin users to accommodate special cases. The result is that even bespoke deals can be **managed and billed through the same system**, maintaining a single source of truth for all subscription revenue. This ensures that the business can execute large contracts without resorting to spreadsheets or separate processes, reducing errors and improving transparency.

### Track Sales and Revenue Metrics

The platform will automatically gather and update key **sales, revenue, and subscription metrics**, providing insights through dashboards and reports. These functional requirements outline what metrics are tracked and how they are used:

* **Active Subscriptions Count:** The system will keep a real-time count of active subscriptions. An “active subscription” is one that is not canceled or expired as of the current date (includes those in trial or grace period). This metric can be broken down by plan, product, customer segment, etc. (For instance, “Active Subscriptions: 500 (300 on Basic, 150 on Pro, 50 on Enterprise)”). This helps monitor growth of subscriber base.
* **New Subscriptions:** Track the number of **new subscriptions started** in a given period (daily, weekly, monthly). Each time a subscription is created (and moves from trial to paid, or starts paid immediately), it increments this metric. The system will log the subscription start date, allowing generation of charts like “New Customers per Month”. This metric is crucial for sales to see how many new signups are coming in.
* **Cancellations and Churn:** Track the number of **cancellations** in a given period and calculate **churn rates**:

  * **Customer Churn Rate:** The percentage of subscribers who cancel during a period relative to the number of subscribers at the start of the period. The system can compute this monthly or annually. E.g., if 100 out of 1000 subscriptions canceled in a quarter, churn rate = 10%.
  * **Revenue Churn (MRR Churn):** The amount of recurring revenue lost due to cancellations or downgrades. For example, if cancellations in March correspond to \$2,000 MRR, that's the gross MRR churn. The system will sum the MRR of all canceled subscriptions (taking their last billed amount as reference).
  * **Net Churn / Expansion:** The platform can also compute **net churn** by factoring upgrades (upsells) in. For instance, if \$2,000 MRR lost but \$500 MRR added from upsells among existing customers, net MRR churn = \$1,500. This ties into upsell metrics below.
  * The system will prompt admin to record a reason on each cancellation (e.g., "Switched to competitor", "Budget issues", etc.). It will track statistics on these reasons (e.g., 30% of churn due to budget). This requires a predefined reason list and a field on cancellation. Reporting can then show churn by reason.
* **Upgrade and Downgrade Metrics:**

  * Count of **upgrades** (customers moving to higher-paying plans) and **downgrades** (moving to lower-paying plans) in a period.
  * Track **Expansion MRR**: additional monthly revenue gained from existing customers through upsells (e.g., a customer increasing from \$100 to \$150 MRR contributes +\$50 expansion).
  * Track **Contraction MRR**: revenue lost from downgrades (e.g., someone going from \$200 to \$100 MRR gives -\$100 contraction).
  * These figures help compute the **Net Revenue Retention**: (Beginning MRR + expansion - contraction - churn) / Beginning MRR. The system can produce this metric, which is important for SaaS health.
* **Recurring Revenue (MRR/ARR):**

  * **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** The system will calculate the total monthly recurring revenue at any given time. This is typically sum of all active subscriptions’ monthly value. If some pay annually, their value is divided by 12 to get monthly equivalent for MRR calculation. MRR should include any recurring add-on fees as well.
  * **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):** Usually just MRR × 12 for a rough figure, or sum of all active subscriptions’ annual values. The system can present ARR as 12 \* MRR (assuming monthly equivalence).
  * MRR should be trackable historically – the platform can snapshot MRR each month’s end to graph MRR growth over time. Alternatively, it can derive history by looking at subscription records effective on each date (which is more computation heavy, so storing a monthly record is easier).
  * The system will handle currency conversion for MRR if multi-currency (likely present MRR per currency or convert to a base currency using a consistent rate).
* **Revenue Recognition Metrics:** (If not fully handled, at least provide data)

  * While accounting does full revenue recognition, the system knows how much revenue is earned each month from each subscription. It can output a report of recognized revenue vs deferred. However, a simpler approach: track **Billings vs Revenue**:

    * Billings: total invoiced in a period (cash flow perspective).
    * Recognized Revenue: portion of invoices that correspond to service delivered in that period.
    * E.g., if an annual invoice of \$1200 came in Jan, billings in Jan +\$1200, revenue in Jan +\$100 (1/12 of 1200).
  * We may leave detailed revenue recognition to finance, but ensure the data (invoices, periods, etc.) is accessible or exportable.
* **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** The platform can assist in LTV calculation by providing average revenue per customer and average lifespan. If churn rate is known, one can approximate LTV = ARPU / churn\_rate. The platform will provide **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)** which is total MRR divided by number of active subscriptions (or customers). For ARPU, perhaps count by account instead of subscription if customers can have multiple subs. The platform’s data can be used to compute LTV by the business; direct LTV might be more of an analytical output.
* **Cohort Analysis:** The system should allow cohort tracking (e.g., group customers by signup month and track retention or revenue expansion in subsequent months). While the heavy lifting might be done outside or by exporting data, at minimum, the platform retains each customer’s signup date and can produce a retention table: for each signup cohort, what % remain after X months. This ties to churn metrics but in cohort form.
* **Upsell/Cross-Sell Uptake:**

  * Track how many customers have multiple product subscriptions (an indicator of cross-sell success). E.g., “50 customers have subscribed to both Product A and B.”
  * The system can list customers by number of distinct products subscribed. If integrated with CRM, can measure account expansion. Internally, we might track the count of subscriptions per customer or revenue per customer to identify top customers and cross-sell penetration.
  * Also track usage of upsell features: e.g., how many used a particular upsell offer (like how many accepted an in-app upgrade offer – requires instrumentation).
* **Reporting Interface:** The platform will include a **dashboard** that visually presents these metrics:

  * A high-level KPI summary (Active Subs, New Subs this month, Churn rate, MRR, etc.).
  * Charts for trends: e.g., a line chart of MRR over the last 12 months, bar chart of new vs churned customers each month, pie chart of current plan distribution.
  * Perhaps a funnel view from trials to paid conversions if trial feature is used (like trial start vs converted).
  * The dashboard should allow filtering by product or region (if data tagged) – e.g., view MRR for Product X only.
  * Also, a specific **Revenue Analytics** page might allow slicing by segment, or showing a breakdown of revenue: recurring vs one-time charges, by geography, etc. Some of these might be achieved via exporting data to CSV for analysis in Excel or a BI tool, which the platform should facilitate.
* **Scheduled Reports and Exports:**

  * Allow scheduling email reports (e.g., a monthly report email to management summarizing key metrics).
  * Provide export of underlying data (e.g., a CSV of all subscriptions and their status, or churn list). Possibly integrate with Google Sheets or similar for dynamic updates (not required, but exports certainly).
* **Accuracy and Reconciliation:** The metrics should tie out with raw data. For example, sum of MRR of each subscription should equal total MRR metric. Finance should be able to reconcile invoiced amounts with changes in MRR (e.g., if MRR increased by \$X, there should be corresponding invoices/upgrades to explain it). Thus the system should ensure consistency and offer drill-down:

  * E.g., clicking on MRR number could list all subscriptions and their contributions.
  * Clicking churn rate could show the list of canceled accounts that month with their MRR.
* **Data Freshness:** These metrics should update **in real-time or near real-time** as transactions occur. If an invoice is generated or a subscription canceled, the relevant metrics (MRR, counts) should update. Possibly some heavy metrics (like cohort retention) might update daily. But core numbers (active subs, MRR) should always reflect latest.
* **Historical Data Migration:** If the business is migrating from another system, they may import some historical figures (or at least not lose them). The platform could allow input of starting metrics or past data. Alternatively, we accept that metrics start from when system goes live, and historical analysis requires combining old data offline.
* **Integration with BI:** Ensure that all underlying data is accessible via API or database so the company’s BI team can run their own queries if needed. For instance, a data warehouse might pull subscription and invoice data nightly for advanced analytics beyond what the platform offers out of the box.
* **Example of Metric Use:**

  * The product manager opens the dashboard and sees **“MRR: \$50,000”** with a green +5% indicating growth over last month. **Active Subscribers: 1,200** (with breakdown by plan in a tooltip). **Churn Rate (Monthly): 3%** with a red arrow indicating it worsened slightly from 2.5% prior. They see **“New Subscriptions: 100, Cancellations: 60”** for the current month, net +40. A graph shows these trends over the past year, revealing seasonality (e.g., spikes in new subs in January).
  * They click on churn 3% to see cancellation reasons: 30% “budget cuts”, 20% “missing feature”, etc., and notice an uptick in “missing feature X” reason. This informs product roadmap.
  * They also check a report for **“Contracts Expiring in next 60 days”** (if implemented in metrics section or separate) to coordinate with sales on renewals.
  * In the **Revenue** tab, they see **Net Revenue Retention: 110%**, which means expansions exceeded churn – a positive sign (common in good B2B SaaS). The breakdown shows \$5k expansion, \$3k churn, net +\$2k on a base of \$20k last year.
  * They export the subscription list to analyze if any particular customer segment has higher churn.
* **Precision:** Financial metrics should be precise and properly rounded to two decimals for currency when displayed. Percentages to one decimal is fine. The system should handle large numbers (scaling units or adding “k”/“M” for thousands/millions in UI if needed).
* **Availability to Users:**

  * Admin-level users (executives, finance, product managers) should see all metrics.
  * Perhaps limit some metrics for certain roles (e.g., a support agent might not need to see revenue metrics, but might see active count and who’s in trial).
  * Possibly provide a limited dashboard to customers (not usually, except maybe a usage metric for their own usage, which is separate).
* **Real-Time Alerts:** (Optional) The system could allow setting thresholds to alert if a metric deviates (e.g., “Churn this month >5% send alert” or “New signups today < target”). This might be a future enhancement. For now, manual monitoring via dashboard suffices.

By automatically tracking these metrics, the platform eliminates the need for manual data gathering and gives stakeholders direct visibility into the health of the subscription business. This supports data-driven decisions – for example, if churn spikes in a given month, the team can quickly investigate and take action. Or if upsell efforts are increasing net retention, that success is clearly measured. Essentially, the platform doesn’t just process subscriptions; it also functions as an analytics tool, turning operational data into actionable business intelligence.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance and Scalability

The platform must be performant under expected load and capable of scaling as the business grows:

* **Response Time:** The application should provide a smooth user experience. Target average page load times of \~2 seconds or less for typical pages on a high-speed connection. Most UI interactions (viewing a customer account, generating an invoice) should execute in under 3 seconds on the backend. The UI should use asynchronous loading and feedback to avoid locking the interface. For example, when an admin clicks “Save” on an invoice, it should process within a couple of seconds and show confirmation. Searches and filtering operations should feel instantaneous on typical dataset sizes (a few thousand records).
* **Throughput and Concurrency:** The system should support dozens of simultaneous admin users and hundreds of customer portal users without performance degradation. For instance, it might handle **100 concurrent admin sessions** performing actions and **1000 concurrent customer sessions** viewing or updating subscriptions. It should also handle spikes – e.g., many customers logging in around a billing date or many invoices generating at midnight. The architecture (detailed later) will be multi-tier and horizontally scalable to meet these needs.
* **Batch Processing Windows:** Batch jobs (like nightly billing) must complete within limited windows. If 10,000 subscriptions renew on the 1st of the month, the system should ideally process those within e.g. 1-2 hours. Designing efficient bulk operations or parallel processing is important. If using distributed job workers, tasks can be spread to finish sooner.
* **Scalability:** The platform is designed to scale horizontally. We can add more application servers to handle increased user load and more robust database hardware or replicas to handle data growth. The system should scale to manage e.g. **10x the current volume** (if currently 1,000 subscriptions, aim for 10,000+ with proper tuning).

  * The database should use indexing and query optimization to handle large tables (on the order of millions of rows) for core entities without timeouts. Key queries (like fetching a subscription by ID, or listing active subs) should remain fast (tens of milliseconds) due to indexes.
  * Application logic that might become slow with growth (e.g., computing metrics by scanning entire tables) should be reworked to incremental updates or use read replicas/analytic stores as needed.
* **Resource Efficiency:** The system should not be unnecessarily heavy. Use caching for expensive computations (for example, caching aggregated metrics so the dashboard doesn’t recompute MRR from scratch on each load). Also leverage browser caching for static content and avoid reloading data that hasn’t changed (progressive enhancement).
* **Load Testing:** Before production, conduct load tests to verify the system meets performance targets under expected peak load. For example, simulate 50 admins adding subscriptions simultaneously, or generate 1000 invoices in a batch, and measure response times and system metrics. Tune as necessary (e.g., adjust DB indexes, allocate more memory).
* **High Availability:** Aim for minimal downtime. The system will be deployed in a redundant configuration (multiple servers, backup database). There should be no single point of failure. If an app server goes down, the load balancer routes traffic to others; if the primary database fails, a replica should take over quickly (with minimal data loss). Our goal is to achieve at least **99.9% uptime**, which equates to <\~1.5 minutes downtime per day or <\~45 minutes per month.
* **Failover and Recovery:** In case of a crash or outage, the system should recover gracefully. Session state is mostly stateless on server (using tokens or cookies), so a reboot of servers should not log users out (unless session store is in-memory and lost – better to use a persistent session store if not stateless). After a failover, any in-progress background tasks should be resumed or rolled back safely (e.g., if billing job stopped at half, either pick up where left off or start over idempotently).
* **Maintainability and Scalability of Architecture:** The architecture should allow adding new modules (like a new integration or a new service) without major rework. This means following modular design patterns and possibly microservices for clearly separated concerns. For scalability, critical components can be scaled independently if needed (for example, if the reporting module becomes resource-intensive, it could be offloaded to a separate service reading from a replicated DB).
* **Elastic Scalability:** If hosted on cloud infrastructure, the system should be able to auto-scale within configured bounds. For example, spin up additional application instances when CPU or request latency crosses threshold and shut them down when load decreases, to handle bursty loads cost-efficiently.
* **Data Scalability:**

  * Plan for data retention and archiving strategy so that the primary database doesn’t grow indefinitely with old records. For example, maybe archives invoices older than 7 years to another store if needed for legal retention but not active usage. (Compliance wise, likely keep 7-10 years of financial records).
  * Use partitioning or sharding techniques if one table grows extremely large (not likely at moderate scale, but design shouldn’t preclude it).
* **Client-Side Performance:** Ensure front-end code is bundled/minified and avoids heavy computations in the browser. Use lazy loading for large tables (paginate results) so as not to render thousands of DOM elements at once. Use web workers if needed for any heavy client tasks (which are few, since most logic is server-side).
* **Network Efficiency:** Use compression (gzip) for responses, keep payloads small by only sending necessary fields. Possibly use GraphQL or selective REST fields to avoid over-fetching data. Leverage CDNs for static resources to speed up global access.
* **Scalability Testing Use Case:** Simulate scenario like a large customer with 1,000 subscriptions under one account and ensure the UI (customer detail page) can load that many subscription entries efficiently (maybe by paging them). Or if an admin requests an export of 50k records, ensure it streams data rather than timing out.
* **Capacity Planning:** The system should include monitoring hooks (application metrics for CPU, memory, DB queries, queue lengths) so the operations team can see when we are nearing capacity and need to scale up. Non-functional but important that architecture supports adding such monitoring.
* **Example:** Under normal load, an admin listing all customers (maybe 100 per page) gets results in <1 second. At end of quarter when many contracts are closing, maybe 20 admins might be doing heavy operations concurrently, the system might slow slightly but still each action <3-4 seconds. If load goes beyond, additional app nodes can be added to distribute. The database, perhaps using a read-replica for read-heavy operations like metrics queries, avoids being a bottleneck for writes (which are fewer).

Overall, the system is expected to handle the current load with room to grow and degrade gracefully under stress. We aim for a responsive UI and an architecture that can be scaled horizontally to meet increasing demand, ensuring a smooth experience for users and timely processing of critical billing events.

### Security

Security is of paramount importance since the platform will handle sensitive customer information (personal details, subscription usage) and payment data. The system must implement robust security controls to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability:

* **User Authentication & Session Management:**

  * Implement strong authentication for all user access. Admin and internal users will log in with a username/email and password. Passwords must be stored securely (hashed with a strong algorithm like bcrypt). Enforce password complexity and allow administrators to set rotation policies if needed.
  * Support **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for admin users. Given the sensitivity (especially finance admins who can refund or export data), having an OTP (One Time Password) via authenticator app or SMS adds a layer. This may be optional to configure.
  * Use secure session tokens (e.g., HTTPOnly cookies with secure flag for web). Consider short session lifetimes and automatic timeout of idle sessions (e.g., auto-logout admin after 15 minutes of inactivity) to reduce hijacked session risk.
  * Protect against common auth attacks: rate-limit login attempts to mitigate brute force (e.g., after 5 failed attempts, require a captcha or temporarily lock the account for a few minutes). Also monitor and alert on suspicious login patterns (multiple failures, or login from new IP).
  * Provide secure password reset flows: e.g., email a time-limited, one-time link to reset, or integration with SSO if the company uses centralized identity.
  * For customer self-service portal, similar practices: though customers typically have their own login for account management, often they may log in via the company’s product, but if not, ensure same strength.
* **Authorization and Access Control:**

  * Enforce **role-based access control (RBAC)** throughout the application. Every API endpoint and UI page should check the user’s role/permissions. For example, only users with “Billing Admin” role can issue refunds or modify plan pricing, Support agents might have read-only access to billing info but not create invoices, etc. Define roles: e.g., System Admin, Billing Manager, Sales, Support, ReadOnly, and enforce accordingly.
  * Customers accessing the portal can only see and manage their own subscriptions. The system must validate customer identity on every request (e.g., a customer should not be able to fetch another customer’s data by changing an ID in URL – implement checks like `WHERE customer_id = current_user.id` in queries). This prevents horizontal escalation between customer accounts.
  * Use **least privilege** principle: ensure each internal user only has the minimum permissions needed. Possibly allow custom fine-grained permissions in the future (like a user can view data but not export it, etc.). At minimum, separate who can see payment details vs who can only see summary.
  * Provide an audit trail of admin actions (addressed in Auditing section) to backtrack any unauthorized attempts or mistakes.
* **Data Encryption:**

  * **In Transit:** All communication between users and the platform will be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher. The web app will be served only over HTTPS (and HSTS headers set to enforce it). Similarly, any API integrations (webhooks, etc.) must use HTTPS endpoints. Internal calls between services (if microservices or DB connections) should also be encrypted, especially if not on the same secure network.
  * **At Rest:**

    * Use encryption for sensitive data fields in the database. Most critically, **payment data** – although we store only tokens, we should still treat them carefully. Cardholder data (PAN) is not stored (we store only last4 and perhaps expiration, which are not sensitive alone, but combine with name could be considered personal).
    * For any stored secrets (like API keys for payment gateway, or email server creds), use an encrypted secrets vault or secure configuration store rather than plain text files. Limit access to these secrets.
    * Full database encryption (transparent disk encryption) will be enabled if available on the DB engine (many cloud DBs do this by default).
    * Encrypt backup files as well.
    * **PCI DSS compliance**: Cardholder data should be encrypted at rest with strong encryption and proper key management. We primarily rely on not storing card numbers, but if we store even vault tokens, ensure those are not easily usable outside context (they usually aren’t, only work with our merchant account).
    * Ensure **keys** for encryption are stored securely separate from encrypted data (e.g., use a Key Management Service). Rotate keys periodically if feasible.
  * **Sensitive Personal Data:** While not highly sensitive like cards, personal data (names, addresses, emails) is still sensitive (PII). Consider using database encryption or application layer encryption for fields like personal addresses or at least ensure database access is controlled. Many systems rely on overall DB protection rather than field encryption for PII – we will do that plus have ability to purge per GDPR.
* **Payment Security (PCI Compliance):**

  * The system and processes will be designed to meet PCI DSS requirements since we handle payment card data. Key requirements addressed:

    * Never store full credit card numbers, CVV, or magnetic stripe data on our servers post-authorization. We will use payment gateway tokenization – meaning the full PAN and CVV are captured on a secure iFrame or hosted field provided by the gateway or via a secure JavaScript that sends directly to gateway, so our server receives only a token. This greatly reduces PCI scope (possibly to SAQ A-EP or similar).
    * If for some reason we must handle PAN (e.g., in call center scenario an admin enters card for a customer), then ensure the web interface uses TLS and that PAN is immediately transmitted to gateway and not stored. If any temporary storage is needed (should not), it must be encrypted and wiped.
    * The system should mask card data on display – e.g., show only last4 and brand, never the full number, to any user (even admins). CVV is never displayed or stored. Expiration date can be stored and shown as it’s not sensitive alone (maybe just month/year).
    * PCI Requirement 7 (restrict data access by need-to-know) is met by RBAC (only certain roles can even see the last4 and billing info). Others might just see “Card on file: Visa ending 4242”.
    * PCI Requirement 10 (logging of access to card data): We will log whenever an admin views or changes payment method details so that we have an audit trail.
    * Maintain secure network: the system’s servers should be behind firewalls and not publicly expose anything except the app ports. No default passwords on any system components.
    * Regular vulnerability scans and possibly external audits will be needed (this is more operational, but the system must accommodate applying patches, etc.).
  * *Summary:* Offload as much payment data handling to the gateway as possible, keep our environment’s PCI scope small, and implement strict controls on whatever minimal data we do hold (like tokens and last4).
* **Secure Development Practices:**

  * Follow **OWASP Top 10** guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities:

    * **Injection:** Use parameterized queries or ORM for all database access, no string concatenation SQL. Similarly, avoid OS command injections (we likely don’t run OS commands with user input, but if any, sanitize inputs).
    * **XSS:** All user-supplied data displayed in the UI should be properly HTML-encoded. Use templating frameworks that auto-escape by default. For rich text fields (if any), use white-listing or sanitizer. Ensure that the customer portal cannot be used to inject scripts that might affect admin interface (they are separate contexts, but just caution).
    * **CSRF:** Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing POST/PUT/DELETE requests in the web app. Our framework should attach a CSRF token in forms and validate on server side. Also, for APIs if using JWT, CSRF is not an issue in same way as cookies (as long as no cross-site usage).
    * **Clickjacking:** Send X-Frame-Options or CSP header to prevent our content from being framed by another site (except where needed).
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Consider a CSP to restrict script sources to our domain and approved sources (this can mitigate XSS impact by disallowing external scripts).
    * **Error Handling:** Don’t expose stack traces or sensitive info in error messages. Log detailed errors internally, but show users generic messages. E.g., “An unexpected error occurred” rather than DB error line.
    * **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize inputs on both client and server side. E.g., dates should be valid dates, numeric fields non-negative, etc. This not only prevents injection but also ensures data integrity (e.g., no impossible subscription dates).
    * **File Uploads:** If any file upload (like contract PDF upload), restrict file types and scan if necessary. Store in non-executable directory (like on cloud storage or with no execute permissions).
  * Use secure libraries and keep dependencies up-to-date. Monitor for vulnerabilities in those libraries (e.g., using GitHub Dependabot or similar).
  * Secure coding training/knowledge for developers should be presumed.
* **Audit and Logging:**

  * **Audit Trail:** Maintain logs of all critical actions (admin logins, changes to plans, creation/cancellation of subscriptions, payment attempts, etc.). These logs should include who (user id) did what and when. Store them in a tamper-evident way if possible (at least make sure normal users can’t erase logs). This correlates with both security monitoring and compliance.
  * **System Logs:** On the server side, log warnings/errors appropriately. Avoid logging sensitive data. For instance, don’t log full credit card numbers or personal passwords in logs. Mask if needed: e.g., log "Payment failed for card ending 4242" instead of logging the whole number or CVV.
  * Keep logs secure – accessible only to authorized personnel. Possibly ship them to a central logging system with limited access.
  * **Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement intrusion detection or at least suspicious behavior alerts. E.g., if an admin account performs an unusually high number of data exports or if someone is repeatedly triggering errors that could indicate probing, flag it.
  * For PCI compliance, retain logs for at least a year with easy access to last 3 months (PCI Req 10).
* **Secure Infrastructure:**

  * The application will be deployed on secure servers with latest OS patches. Only necessary network ports open (e.g., 443 for web, DB port only open to app servers). Use of firewalls/Cloud Security Groups to enforce this.
  * Use separate environments (Dev, Test, Prod) with separate credentials. Do not use production data in lower environments unless anonymized.
  * Implement backup and recovery procedures securely (backups encrypted, stored offsite).
  * If using cloud, leverage security groups, IAM roles, etc., for least privilege. E.g., the app server can read/write specific S3 bucket but not list all buckets, etc.
  * Administrative access to production servers (SSH or cloud console) should be limited to few, use MFA, and logged.
* **Compliance and Privacy:**

  * Comply with GDPR: ensure features like the ability to delete customer data on request (the “Right to be forgotten”) are implemented. When an admin deletes a customer per GDPR, remove personal identifying info (but we might keep transactional records by replacing name with “Deleted” and deleting email, etc.). Also allow export of a user’s data (for subject access requests) – likely via an admin tool to compile all data for that user.
  * Respect user privacy: Only use their data for intended purposes. If the platform has any tracking or cookie, implement a cookie consent if needed on portal (depending on if it uses any analytics).
  * If personal data is transferred across borders, ensure compliance (e.g., use EU data centers for EU customers if promised, etc.).
  * The system should be capable of demonstrating compliance via logs (who accessed data, when).
* **Third-Party Components:**

  * Payment Gateways: ensure we use secure integration methods (never embed gateway API secrets in client-side code, etc.). Use webhook signatures to validate that incoming webhooks are truly from the gateway (to prevent spoofing).
  * Email service: use API keys with limited scope for sending only.
  * External APIs: ensure any external calls are made over HTTPS and handle their credentials securely. If connecting to things like tax service, protect those API keys.
  * When using libraries, prefer well-vetted ones. If an open source library seems unmaintained or questionable security, find alternative.
* **Security Testing:**

  * Regularly perform vulnerability scanning on the web application (could use OWASP ZAP or similar) and fix any findings.
  * Ideally have an annual or more frequent **penetration test** by an independent party. The platform should be designed to withstand such attacks.
  * Address any findings promptly with patches or config changes.
  * Incorporate security tests into CI pipeline (like static code analysis for security issues, dependency vulnerability scanning).
* **Incident Response:**

  * (Operational but relevant) The system should have monitoring to detect anomalies (spikes in 500 errors, unusual times of high usage) which could indicate an attack (like a DDoS or exploit attempt). If detected, admins can intervene (scale up or block IPs).
  * If a breach is suspected (e.g., unusual admin login at odd hours), the audit logs and access controls should help identify the scope and impact quickly.
  * Design such that even if one part is compromised (say an admin credential), there are layers (MFA, logging, limited DB rights) to minimize damage and allow quick containment (like disable that account).
* **Data Isolation (Multi-tenant considerations):** If our system eventually hosts multiple companies’ data in one instance, ensure strict data partitioning by tenant ID so one company cannot ever access another’s data. Possibly separate encryption keys per tenant if that level is needed. For now, one company usage, so internal partitioning is by customer accounts which we handle.

In summary, we will implement a **defense-in-depth** approach: secure the application at the code level, secure the data through encryption and access control, secure the environment through network and host measures, and monitor everything. By following industry best practices and compliance standards, the platform will maintain the trust of users and clients that their data (especially payment information) is safe.

### Compliance and Regulatory

The platform must include features and design considerations that ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards (in addition to security-related compliance above). Key compliance requirements:

* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) Compliance:** The system will adhere to GDPR for EU users, which grants individuals rights over their personal data:

  * **Consent and Purpose:** Ensure personal data is collected and used only for legitimate, declared purposes (e.g., managing their subscription, billing). During sign-up, include acceptance of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If any data will be used for marketing beyond service scope, obtain explicit opt-in consent (like a checkbox for newsletters, separate from necessary service emails).
  * **Right of Access:** Provide a way to compile all personal data related to a user if requested. Admins should be able to export a user's data (customer profile, subscriptions, invoices, communications) in a commonly used format (e.g., JSON or CSV) to fulfill a Data Subject Access Request. Possibly automate this via an “Export Data” button that generates a downloadable file or email to the user.
  * **Right to Rectification:** Allow customers (or admins on behalf) to correct their personal information (name, address, etc.). This is already functional via account update forms – ensure no undue restrictions on editing one’s own data.
  * **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):** Implement functionality to delete or anonymize a user’s personal data upon request. Because we may need to keep transaction records for legal/financial reasons, a common approach is to anonymize: e.g., remove or scramble identifying fields (name replaced with “Deleted Customer”, email cleared, payment details removed) while retaining non-identifying transaction records. The platform should have an admin function to perform this. If a user has active subscriptions, likely require cancellation first, then deletion. Document clearly in Privacy Policy and implement a process to handle this within the 30-day window mandated by GDPR.
  * **Right to Restrict Processing:** If a user contests data accuracy or has other issues, they can request a temporary hold on processing. In practice, this might mean we flag their account and pause all marketing or non-essential processing. The system might not have explicit functionality for this besides not doing anything beyond keeping their data, but we can accommodate by not deleting data while flagged. Likely handled administratively.
  * **Right to Data Portability:** Similar to Access, they can get their data in a machine-readable format to port to another service. Our export covers this (CSV/JSON).
  * **Right to Object:** If we were doing any data processing beyond necessity (like profiling or direct marketing), users can object. We should either not do such processing or provide easy opt-outs for things like marketing emails. For instance, ensure any marketing communications have unsubscribe links (via our email system).
  * **Breach Notification:** Although more of an operational task, the system design (audit logs, monitoring) should help quickly identify and report data breaches within 72 hours as required.
  * **Data Minimization:** Only collect data we need. For example, if we don’t need a customer’s date of birth or gender for subscription management, we shouldn’t ask for it.
  * **Privacy by Design:** Many points above (encryption, access control) contribute to this. Also, set defaults to privacy-friendly (e.g., default account settings do not expose their info publicly anywhere, and do not automatically opt them into marketing).
  * **Records of Processing:** We maintain logs and documentation of what personal data is stored and for what purpose (this is an internal compliance doc).
  * The Privacy Policy should outline what data we collect and how it's used, consistent with system behavior.
* **PCI DSS Compliance:** Already covered under security, but in terms of compliance:

  * We will annually attest via PCI SAQ (self-assessment questionnaire) as appropriate (likely SAQ A or A-EP if we handle no card data directly). The platform’s design (tokenization, no PAN storage) ensures we fit into those simpler compliance categories. We will maintain required evidence like network diagrams, access logs, etc., which the system provides (e.g., logs for Req 10).
  * Possibly do quarterly scans (ASV scans) on the system’s external IPs if required by PCI (if applicable).
* **Tax Law Compliance:**

  * Collect and apply taxes appropriately (sales tax, VAT, GST) as described. Also, the system should maintain data needed for tax filings: e.g., total taxable sales in each state/country, exempt sales (if some customers provided exemption certs), etc. We may produce a “Tax Report” per period for finance.
  * Provide VAT invoices to customers in required jurisdictions with necessary information (VAT number of seller and buyer if provided, breakdown of VAT rate and amount). Our invoice template should be customizable to include these details to comply with EU VAT directives.
  * If digital services are sold to EU consumers, comply with **VAT OSS** – meaning charge VAT at buyer’s country rate. Our tax engine integration handles that calculation; we must store buyer country (from address) and maybe one other piece of evidence for location (IP address or bank country) if doing telecommunications/digital services as required by VAT rules. Possibly overkill for our scenario, but mention if relevant.
  * If shipping physical goods, include support for calculating any applicable shipping taxes or use external systems accordingly.
* **Accounting Compliance (Revenue Recognition & Auditing):**

  * While the platform isn’t a full accounting system, it generates records that accountants will use. Ensure the records (invoices, payments) are accurate and retained for legally required periods (often 7 years). Our data retention strategy should not delete financial records prematurely. Even if a customer is “forgotten” per GDPR, we might keep their invoice records (but anonymize name) for accounting audit trail.
  * Provide necessary data for standards like **ASC 606** (which requires deferring revenue over subscription period). Possibly by marking each invoice line with service period dates, which we will do (e.g., invoice covers 2025-01-01 to 2025-12-31 for annual subscription). This way finance can compute deferred revenue easily.
  * The system’s calculations should be auditable – if an auditor asks “why was this customer charged this amount,” an admin can produce the plan details, promotional info, and proration calcs that explain it. So maintain those references and make sure they’re clear (perhaps store original price and discount on each invoice line for traceability).
* **Industry Regulations:** Depending on customers:

  * If any customers are in regulated industries (like government, healthcare), they might demand certain compliance: e.g., **FedRAMP** for US government (very involved, likely out of scope initially unless specifically targeting government). But our design of encryption, audit, etc., is a good start if pursuing such.
  * **HIPAA:** If we ever store any health-related data (unlikely, but if our SaaS was used in health context), we’d need to comply with HIPAA. That would require even stricter controls (e.g., business associate agreement, audit of every PHI access, etc.). We currently do not plan to store health info, so not applicable.
  * **SOC 2:** Many enterprise clients ask for SOC 2 compliance (Security, Availability, Confidentiality, etc.). The platform’s architecture (RBAC, logging, backup, encryption) covers many SOC 2 controls. We would ensure things like change management and incident response processes are in place (operational). From a system perspective, having comprehensive logs and the ability to demonstrate controls will support SOC 2 audits. For example, show that only authorized users can view certain data, or that we have monitoring on uptime (Availability).
  * **ISO 27001:** Similar to SOC2 in terms of requirements and the platform supports needed controls (access control, encryption, etc.). Achieving this is more about organizational process, but system features like audit trails and secure configuration contribute.
* **E-Signature Laws (if applicable):** If the platform sends out contracts for e-sign (maybe via integration with DocuSign or similar), ensure compliance with **ESIGN Act** / **eIDAS** in EU (electronic signatures). Likely out of direct scope – if we do require signatures for contracts, we rely on a compliant e-sign service rather than building our own.
* **Accessibility Compliance (WCAG):** Not a law for software unless in certain contexts (government in many places, or if subject to ADA in US for public accommodation websites). Nonetheless, we aim for **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance in the UI. That means:

  * All pages should be navigable by keyboard (for users with motor disabilities).
  * Provide text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., alt tags on icons/images).
  * Ensure sufficient color contrast for text (aim for AA contrast ratio).
  * Announce dynamic content changes via ARIA for screen readers (like after form submission or errors).
  * This is a quality requirement but also many enterprise customers evaluate accessibility when purchasing software (especially if they have employees with disabilities or want to avoid legal risk).
* **Localization Laws:** If targeting certain markets: e.g., in Quebec, software must be available in French. The platform should be designed to allow localization of UI text (even if we don’t provide translations initially, we can if needed). Also handle localized date/time formats and number formats.

  * We should ensure we can store addresses from various countries properly (different formats, postal codes).
* **Privacy Regulations beyond GDPR:**

  * **CCPA/CPRA (California):** Similar rights to GDPR for California residents (access, deletion, opt-out of sale). Our GDPR features suffice for most (treat as opt-out of sale by default since we don’t sell data, and we do allow deletion). If we ever consider targeted marketing, might need a “Do Not Sell My Info” link to satisfy CCPA (but if we’re not selling or sharing data for cross-company behavioral advertising, we likely are okay).
  * **LGPD (Brazil), PIPEDA (Canada), etc.:** All have broadly similar principles to GDPR regarding user rights and data protection. By complying with GDPR, we cover a lot of these (some have differences like PIPEDA requires honoring if someone requests info on data disclosures).
  * The system should be flexible to adapt to new privacy laws (like if a new state law says store data in-state, we might need data center consideration).
* **Audit Support:** The platform should make it easy to gather evidence for audits:

  * For example, demonstrate who has access to what (maybe an export of user roles and permissions for audit).
  * Show logs of changes (e.g., a report of all plan price changes in last year).
  * The presence of a comprehensive audit log (as per previous Security section) helps compliance audits or investigations.
  * Provide ability for an admin to review user activity (like what did support agent X view or do last week) – possibly via filtered logs interface. This helps in internal compliance oversight.
* **Contractual Compliance:** If the platform will be offered as SaaS to others, ensure the service meets the commitments likely to be in contracts:

  * e.g., **SLA** for uptime – we design for 99.9%.
  * **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** terms – our data handling and security measures should align with typical DPA clauses (we’ve covered encryption, etc.).
  * Ability to assist clients in their compliance – e.g., if a client asks for their data only be stored in EU, we should have a deployment option for EU data center.
* **Continuous Compliance:** Non-functional requirement that the system should not hinder the organization from maintaining certifications (like if we claim SOC2, the system must reliably produce logs and enforce controls year-round so audits pass). If we plan for ISO or others, sometimes certain features are needed (like password rotation enforcement, which we could implement if a client requires it).

In summary, the platform is built not only to be functional but to operate within the legal and regulatory frameworks relevant to subscription services:

* **Personal data protection** features align with laws like GDPR, giving users control over their data.
* **Payment processing** aligns with industry standards (PCI DSS) to protect card data and maintain trust.
* **Accounting and tax compliance** features ensure the business can meet financial reporting obligations.
* **Accessibility and localization** ensure the platform can be used in required markets and by all users, which is often a compliance or at least contractual requirement.
* **Auditability** ensures that if any question arises about compliance, we have the records to demonstrate what was done and by whom.

By embedding compliance into the system design (“compliance by design”), we reduce the risk of legal issues, avoid fines (for privacy breaches or PCI non-compliance), and make the platform more appealing to enterprise customers who often require proof of these capabilities during procurement.

## System Architecture Overview

The system is designed with a scalable, modular architecture that separates concerns and supports the platform’s functional and non-functional requirements. It follows a multi-tier architecture comprising the presentation layer (UI/UX), application layer (business logic and APIs), and data layer (databases and storage), plus integrations with external services (payment gateway, email, etc.). The architecture emphasizes security, reliability, and extensibility.

**High-Level Architecture Diagram (for conceptual understanding):**

```
[Web Browser UI]  <--HTTPS-->  [Application Server/API]  <--->  [Database]

```

*(Note: The Admin web UI and Customer portal can be served by the same application server(s) but with different permission contexts. They are shown as separate browser clients hitting the same backend.)*

### Components:

* **Web Front-End (Presentation Layer):**

  * This includes the **Admin Portal UI** for internal users and the **Customer Self-Service Portal UI** for customers. These are web applications (could be a single-page app or a server-rendered app with progressive enhancement).
  * The front-end is delivered via HTTPS from a web server or CDN. It interacts with the backend purely through secure HTTP API calls (likely RESTful JSON APIs).
  * The UI is designed to be responsive and accessible, using modern frameworks (e.g., React/Vue or templating engine) but it remains separate from business logic (which resides in the server).
  * Static assets (CSS, JS, images) are served via CDN for performance.
  * The front-end includes client-side validation and user-friendly features but relies on the server for critical validations and data.
  * The front-end code does not contain sensitive credentials (all secret keys are on server).
  * **Security:** The front-end uses secure cookies or tokens for auth. It has built-in CSRF protection (embedding tokens in requests). Also implements content security headers.
* **Application Server (Application Layer):**

  * The core of the platform runs on one or more **Application Server** instances. This could be implemented in a robust web framework (Java Spring Boot, Node.js/Express, Python Django/Flask, etc.). It provides the **REST API** endpoints that both the admin and customer UIs use. It also serves the server-rendered pages if that approach is used for some parts.
  * Key sub-components/modules of the application:

    * **Authentication & Authorization Module:** Handles login, token generation, password hashing, session management, and RBAC enforcement on each request. Likely middleware that checks user roles against required permission for an API endpoint.
    * **Customer Management Module:** CRUD for customer accounts, contact info, etc. Ensures compliance with GDPR requests (deletion, export functionality ties in here).
    * **Subscription Management Module:** Implements business logic for creating subscriptions, changing plans, pausing, canceling, and retrieving subscription details. It applies proration logic using the Pricing module and updates subscription records and related history.
    * **Plan & Pricing Module:** Contains logic for pricing calculations, applying promotions, and validating coupon codes. When an order is to be created, this module computes totals, taxes, discounts. It likely interfaces with a **Tax Service Integration** to get tax amounts for an invoice.
    * **Billing/Invoice Module:** Responsible for generating invoices on schedule or on events (like immediate on purchase). It creates invoice records, lines (including any discounts/taxes), and then triggers the Payment module if auto-payment is needed. It also handles marking invoices paid and recording payment date/method.
    * **Payment Integration Module:** Encapsulates all interactions with the external payment gateway(s). This includes:

      * Tokenization calls (e.g., to save a new card – possibly done via front-end directly to gateway for security, but if via server, then here).
      * Charge calls (make a charge or create a subscription charge with gateway, handle responses).
      * Refund calls.
      * It also handles gateway webhooks (e.g., Stripe sending a webhook on charge succeeded or failed). The module verifies webhook signatures and updates records (e.g., mark invoice paid if a webhook confirms a late payment success, or flag a payment failure to start dunning).
      * This module ensures PCI scope is limited by using gateway tokens and not storing card data locally.
    * **Promotion Module:** Manages creation and validation of promo codes. On an order creation, it checks any code given against the promotions database (if valid, not expired, usage count). It then instructs pricing module to apply discount. It also increments usage count and perhaps records which customer used it.
    * **Dunning & Notification Module:** Might be combined or separate.

      * Dunning: If a payment fails, this module schedules retries and generates emails. It interfaces with the Job Queue (e.g., schedule a retry 3 days later) and Notification module to send a “payment failed” email to customer. It updates subscription status to Past Due.
      * Notification: A generic system to send emails or other notifications (SMS) to users. For instance, send welcome email, trial expiration warning, upcoming renewal notice, receipt, etc. It likely adds tasks to email queue with templates and user info. It integrates with the Email service via API to actually send.
      * It might also handle in-app notifications if needed (for admin dashboard alerts, etc.).
    * **Reporting/Analytics Module:** Handles generation of metrics and reports. This might involve complex queries (possibly on a read replica or a cached summary table). For real-time dashboard, it may query the main DB for current counts or use pre-aggregated data updated by triggers or scheduled jobs.

      * This module provides API endpoints for the front-end dashboards (e.g., `/api/metrics?month=2025-01` returns JSON of all relevant metrics for that month).
      * For heavy analyses (like churn cohort), it might do on-demand computation or fetch from a separate analytics DB if one is used.
    * **Background Job Scheduler/Worker:** Part of the application server or separate processes that handle asynchronous tasks. This covers sending emails, generating large reports, processing scheduled subscription renewals (though some renewal processing might also be kicked off by time-based triggers).

      * We use a job queue (like a message queue or task queue). E.g., the app server, when needing to send an email, pushes a job onto **Queue** (Redis or RabbitMQ) and a **Worker** process consumes and executes it (send via email API). This prevents web request delays.
      * Scheduled tasks (like nightly billing) can be triggered by a **Scheduler** (cron job or scheduled Lambda) that enqueues the batch job at midnight.
      * The worker and app share code libraries (to do things like create invoices).
    * **Integration Handlers:** for connecting to external systems beyond payment:

      * **CRM Integration:** perhaps webhooks on certain events (e.g., when a new subscription is created, call a webhook or API to CRM to update that account record). Or a batch sync that runs daily.
      * **Accounting Integration:** possibly export invoice data to an accounting system (maybe an API or just allow CSV export).
      * These are optional and likely custom per deployment, so might be implemented as plugins or separate scripts that use the API.
    * **Configuration Management:** There might be config for things like tax rates (if not using external service) or feature toggles. A module or config file accessible via admin UI (for instance, turn on/off free trial globally, set default trial length, etc.).
  * The Application Server is stateless (no session data in memory beyond request scope), so it can be load-balanced and scaled easily. Any persistent data (sessions, jobs) is in external stores.
  * It connects to the database(s) for data and uses secure credentials from config. It also connects to cache and external APIs as needed.
  * **Security in App Layer:** All inputs from front-end are validated/escaped to prevent injection. RBAC checks on every endpoint. Sensitive operations (like refund) might require re-auth (maybe ask admin to re-enter password or use MFA code as extra step – a possible enhancement).
  * The API should implement throttling to prevent abuse (e.g., limit certain expensive endpoints to X calls per minute per user or IP).
  * Logging is done here: each request logs who did what, and errors are logged with stack trace internally.
* **Database (Data Layer):**

  * A primary relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) stores structured data: customers, users, subscriptions, plans, invoices, payments, promotion codes, etc. Relational DB is ideal for transactional consistency (ensuring an invoice and payment update occur together). We will use transactions to maintain consistency (e.g., creating a subscription and generating its first invoice in one transaction so either both succeed or both fail).
  * The schema will be normalized for core entities. E.g., a `Subscription` table references a `Customer` and a `Plan`. An `Invoice` references a `Customer` and potentially a `Subscription` (or it might just list line items each referencing a subscription or plan).
  * Sensitive data in DB (like user passwords, tokens, maybe last4 of card) are stored hashed or encrypted as needed.
  * The DB is secured by allowing connections only from the App Server (and perhaps a read replica from app or a bastion for admin).
  * A **read replica** can be set up to offload reporting queries or heavy reads (like generating a huge export) so the primary isn’t impacted. The application’s reporting module can direct read queries to the replica where consistency timing is not critical.
  * Use indexes on frequent query fields (customer\_id on subscriptions, etc.). Possibly use partial indexes for active subscriptions, etc., to speed up common queries.
  * Consider partitioning large tables by date (like invoices by year) if needed down the line to manage big data.
  * Implement stored procedures or triggers for certain tasks if it simplifies logic (e.g., update aggregate counters, though often app logic can handle it).
  * **NoSQL/Secondary Storage:** If we anticipate needing full-text search (e.g., search all customer names quickly or search invoice line text), we might integrate Elasticsearch. Alternatively, use PostgreSQL’s text search features. A separate search service could be updated via the job queue to keep in sync with DB.
  * **Data Warehouse:** For advanced analytics (like cohort retention), a separate analytics DB or warehouse might be used. The system can nightly copy relevant data to a star schema. Initially, we assume the main DB or read replica can handle metrics queries for moderate scale. But architecture allows plugging in a warehouse later (e.g., using a service like Snowflake or BigQuery with pipeline).
* **Cache:**

  * Use an in-memory cache store (Redis) for ephemeral data:

    * Session store (if not using JWT tokens, but likely we use stateless JWT or cookie that doesn’t require server session store; however, for admin sessions we might store some state in cache for quick access or blacklisting tokens).
    * Caching of frequently used reference data: e.g., plan list, or configuration settings, so the app doesn’t query the DB each time. Also caching metric results for dashboard if real-time calculation is heavy (maybe update every X minutes).
    * Job queue (if using Redis for background jobs as many frameworks do).
    * Rate-limiting counters (store per-IP or per-user request counts).
  * Redis itself should be secured (require AUTH, accessible only within VPC).
  * The app should handle cache misses gracefully (just fetch from DB if not in cache).
* **Background Job/Queue System:**

  * Could use Redis-based queue (like Sidekiq for Ruby, Bull for Node, Celery for Python, etc.) or a message broker like RabbitMQ. This decouples tasks like sending emails or processing a batch from the web request cycle.
  * We have one or more **Worker** processes subscribed to the queue. They pop tasks and execute them. E.g., a “SendEmail(userID, template)” task causes worker to fetch user data from DB and send via email service.
  * For scheduled jobs, either an external scheduler adds tasks to queue at given times or use a library in a long-running process with timers.
  * Ensure idempotency where needed (like if a job fails mid-run and is retried, handle not double-sending or double-charging).
  * The queue is configured to **retry** failed jobs a certain number of times with delays (for transient issues like a mail server downtime).
  * There could be separate queues for different priority tasks (e.g., real-time tasks vs heavy nightly tasks) to ensure critical ones aren’t delayed behind large jobs.
* **External Service Integrations:**

  * **Payment Gateway:** (e.g., Stripe) integrated via their API and SDK. We will use their tokenization (Stripe Elements or similar on front-end to directly get a token). The backend uses Stripe’s secret key to create charges, subscriptions (if we were to use Stripe’s subscription object, but likely we manage logic and use one-off charges or saved card for each cycle).

    * Webhooks from Stripe are received at a designated endpoint (e.g., `/webhook/stripe`). The Application’s Payment Module verifies the signature and processes events: e.g., `invoice.payment_failed` triggers our dunning logic, `charge.refunded` triggers marking payment as refunded in our system, etc.
    * The gateway integration is abstracted so we can swap to a different gateway by implementing the same interface (if needed for different regions or clients).
  * **Email Service:** (e.g., SendGrid) using an API key to send emails. The Notification Module formats emails (likely uses templates with placeholders). Could either send via SMTP or HTTP API. HTTP API is preferred for better control and analytics. This service also can provide delivery status, which we might log (not critical to core function, but good to note bounces).
  * **Tax API:** (e.g., Avalara) our app will call Avalara’s API whenever an invoice is created or a cart is priced to get tax amounts. We send company’s tax ID, customer address, line items, and it returns tax breakdown which we apply. We then might also commit the transaction via Avalara so they handle filings. The integration is optional – if not using Avalara, we fallback to manual tax rates config. The architecture allows plugging such a service easily since our Pricing module already is designed to call out for tax calculation.
  * **CRM Integration:** If sales uses a CRM (Salesforce), we might implement either:

    * Outbound webhooks from our system on events (like new subscription -> send webhook to CRM).
    * Or allow CRM to poll our API for latest subscription info.
    * Possibly, if deeper integration needed, use middleware or an iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service). But our system just provides secure APIs and perhaps an interface to map CRM IDs to our customer IDs.
  * **Accounting Software:** Some companies might want invoices fed into QuickBooks or Netsuite. We can implement an export or use an API if provided. E.g., QuickBooks Online API to create sales receipts or records for each invoice. The architecture might include a small service or scheduled job for this integration.
  * **Analytics Platforms:** We might push certain events to an analytics or BI tool (like Mixpanel or internal data warehouse). Or rely on the internal reporting plus ability to export data for BI usage externally.
  * All external connections will use secure channels and be configured with credentials stored in environment variables or secure config, not hardcoded.
  * External service failures: the system should handle gracefully. E.g., if tax service is down, have a backup rate or notify admin to handle taxes manually temporarily. If payment gateway is down, queue the charge to retry soon rather than losing it.
* **Deployment Environment:**

  * The app servers and possibly workers run on a cluster (could be containerized with Docker and orchestrated by Kubernetes, or simply on virtual machines behind a load balancer).
  * The database runs on a managed service or cluster with primary and replica(s) and automated backups.
  * The cache and queue are also likely managed or on dedicated instances.
  * The whole system likely resides in a cloud VPC with restricted access.
  * We will use separate environments for dev/test vs production, with production environment locked down and monitoring enabled.
  * The system is designed to allow scaling:

    * Spin up more app servers when needed (stateless horizontally scalable).
    * The database can scale reads with replicas and scale vertically for writes (or partition if extremely large scale).
    * Use of container orchestration means we can adjust replica counts easily (especially under auto-scaling triggers).
    * Add more worker instances if background tasks grow (to ensure things like sending thousands of emails doesn’t lag).
  * Logging/Monitoring: Include a logging aggregator (ELK stack or cloud logging service) to collect logs from all components for centralized analysis. Use monitoring tools (like CloudWatch, Datadog, or Prometheus/Grafana) to watch metrics (CPU, memory, response times, DB slow queries, etc.). This is crucial to meet our performance and uptime objectives.
  * **Security groups and network:** Only the load balancer accepts public traffic on HTTPS -> forwards to app servers on their port. App servers connect to DB, which only accepts from app security group. Admin access to servers maybe via VPN or bastion with MFA. This architecture ensures minimal exposure.
* **Future Extensibility:**

  * The modular architecture means we can evolve parts independently. For instance, if we launch a new billing model like usage-based billing, we can develop a Usage Tracking microservice that collects usage and the Billing module can incorporate that into invoice calculation.
  * Or if we need a mobile app in future, it can use the same API.
  * Multi-tenant: currently likely single-tenant (one business managing its customers). If offering as SaaS to multiple vendors, we’d incorporate a tenant ID in all data and possibly a separate “tenant management module” (which signs up companies, provisions isolated data scopes). Our RBAC and data model can be extended for that (ensuring queries filter by tenant, etc.). We already plan strong data isolation which aligns with that need.

**Summary of Data Flow for a typical operation (e.g., Customer upgrade plan):**

1. Customer clicks “Upgrade” on portal. The front-end sends a request `POST /subscriptions/{id}/upgrade` with new plan info.
2. The Application Server receives it, authenticates the customer, authorizes that they own that subscription.
3. Subscription Module computes proration via Pricing Module, which maybe calls Payment Module to immediately charge proration amount. Payment Module interacts with Gateway (e.g., Stripe) – Stripe returns success.
4. Subscription Module updates the subscription record in DB (plan\_id changed, price updated if needed) within a transaction along with creating an invoice record for proration charge and payment record. DB transaction commits.
5. The Notification Module enqueues an “Upgrade Confirmation Email” to Email Queue.
6. The response returns success to front-end. Front-end updates UI to show new plan details.
7. Meanwhile, a Worker picks up the email job and sends out the email via SendGrid API.
8. All events are logged (in audit log: “Customer X upgraded subscription Y from Basic to Pro on 2025-03-15 10:00 UTC”).

This architecture ensures each part of the process is handled by the appropriate component, maintaining separation of concerns (making it easier to maintain and scale) and ensuring that the system is robust (with transactions for data consistency and retries for external calls). It is designed to fulfill the detailed requirements we have outlined for functionality, security, and performance.

## UI/UX Requirements and Mockup Descriptions

The platform will feature two primary user interfaces: an **Admin Portal** for internal users (product managers, billing/admin staff, support, sales) and a **Customer Portal** for end-users (customers managing their own subscriptions). Both interfaces should be intuitive, informative, and aligned with modern UI/UX best practices. This section describes the UI/UX requirements for key components and provides mockup descriptions to illustrate the expected design and flow.

### General UI/UX Principles

* **Clear Information Hierarchy:** Use logical layouts with clear headings, sections, and grouping of related elements so users can easily scan and find what they need. Important information and actions should be prominent. For example, on a customer account page, the customer’s name and account status appear at top, followed by key details, then lists of subscriptions and invoices in separate sections.
* **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent design language (colors, typography, buttons) across admin and customer portals to reduce cognitive load. Navigation menus should appear in consistent locations. Use standard icons (e.g., pencil icon for edit, trash for delete) to leverage user familiarity.
* **Feedback and Confirmation:** The UI should provide immediate feedback for user actions. When an admin saves changes or a customer updates a payment method, show a success message or highlight the updated field. For potentially destructive actions (cancel subscription, delete customer), present a confirmation dialog (“Are you sure?”) to prevent accidental execution.
* **Simplicity of Workflows:** Aim to minimize steps required for common tasks. E.g., an admin creating a new subscription for a customer can do so from the customer’s page in one form, rather than navigating through multiple pages. Frequently used actions should be accessible (not buried). Navigation should be streamlined – e.g., a left sidebar menu in the admin portal with main sections (Dashboard, Customers, Subscriptions, Plans, Reports, Settings).
* **Search and Filtering:** Provide robust search and filter capabilities in lists to quickly locate specific records (customer, subscription, invoice). For example, a search bar at top of the Customers list allowing search by name, email, or customer ID. Filtering options could include status (active, trial, canceled) or plan type. In the admin portal, this helps manage large data sets efficiently.
* **Mobile-Responsive Design:** The customer portal, especially, should be mobile-friendly (since customers might access on the go). The admin portal can be optimized for desktop (as admins likely use large screens), but it should at least be usable on tablet. Critical information and actions should reflow nicely on smaller screens (cards stack vertically, menus collapse to hamburger, tables become scrollable or transform into cards).
* **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG AA guidelines. Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and labeled (for screen readers). Use sufficient color contrast for text. Do not rely on color alone to convey status (e.g., add icons or text in addition to color). Provide text alternatives for icons (via `title` or screen-reader-only text). This ensures the platform is usable by people with disabilities and compliant with accessibility standards.
* **Mockup/Design Style:** Use a clean, professional aesthetic. Possibly the company branding (logo, color palette) integrated. For example, maybe a top header with company logo and name of portal, simple icons for settings or profile.
* **Localization-Ready:** (If needed) design UI to handle different lengths of text (e.g., buttons should be flexible width to accommodate translations).

### Admin Portal UI/UX

**Dashboard (Admin Home):**

* Upon login, admins see a **Dashboard** overview. This page highlights key metrics (active subscriptions, MRR, new signups, churn rate, etc.) in summary cards or charts for quick health assessment. For example, four top-level cards: “Active Subscriptions: 1200”, “MRR: \$50k”, “New this month: 100”, “Churn this month: 3%”. Below, a couple of charts: maybe a line chart of MRR over last 12 months and a bar chart of new vs churned customers in the last few months.
* It may also list recent important events or alerts: e.g., “5 payments failed in the past day (link to dunning queue)” or “3 contracts expiring next month”.
* The design should be uncluttered – key stats at a glance with ability to click into deeper reports.

**Customers Management Page:**

* An Admin can click “Customers” in the navigation. This brings a list/table of customer accounts. Columns include Customer Name, Email/Company, Status (e.g., Active, Canceled, Delinquent), Signup Date, and maybe Current MRR for that customer.
* At the top, a search bar (to search by name or email) and filter dropdown (e.g., filter by status or customer segment).
* The table is paginated or infinite-scrolling if many records.
* Each row likely has an action (View or Edit). Clicking the customer name opens the **Customer Details** page.

**Customer Details Page (Admin View):**

* This page provides a comprehensive view of one customer’s info. It might be divided into sections or tabs:

  1. **Profile section**: shows customer’s basic info – Name, Company (if applicable), Email, Phone, Billing Address, Shipping Address (if used). Perhaps a label for customer type or segment. It also shows status (Active, or if canceled, “No active subscriptions” or account closed).

     * An “Edit” button allows modifying these details. Editing opens inline form fields or a modal to change, then save.
  2. **Subscriptions section**: lists all subscriptions associated with this customer. For each subscription, show Plan name, Status (Active/Trial/Paused/Canceled), Next Renewal date, Amount (per period), and perhaps Start date. There may be quick action buttons per subscription, like “Change Plan”, “Cancel”, “View Details”.

     * If a subscription is in trial, highlight that (maybe a badge “Trial – ends Sep 1”).
     * If paused, indicate paused until X date.
     * Possibly allow expanding a subscription row to see more details (like history of upgrades/downgrades or upcoming schedule).
  3. **Invoices/Billing section**: lists recent invoices or payments. Columns for Invoice Date, Period covered, Amount, Status (Paid, Due, Failed), and a link to view/download invoice.

     * The admin can click an invoice to see its details (line items, payment events). If a payment failed, it may have a “Retry Now” action (for an admin to manually trigger earlier than scheduled).
  4. **Payment Methods**: displays the payment methods on file for that customer (e.g., “Visa ending 4242, exp 04/24”) with indication of which is default. Admins can update these (e.g., if customer gave a new card over phone, admin can enter it, likely via payment gateway UI or a secure form).
  5. **Contract/Notes** (if applicable): If this customer is under a contract, display contract terms (like “2-year contract until 12/2023”) and maybe link to the document. Also possibly an internal notes field for admins (e.g., “Customer requested invoice splitting”).
* The layout might use a two-column design on wide screens: left column for profile and payment info, right column for subscriptions and invoices (which might be wider tables). Or tabs: “Subscriptions” and “Billing History” as separate tabs for clarity.
* Actions available on this page might include:

  * “Add Subscription” (to quickly add a new subscription for this customer – opens a form to pick plan, etc.).
  * “Record Payment” (for if customer paid offline – allows admin to mark an invoice paid).
  * “Delete Customer” (for GDPR – likely only available to very high-permission users, with warnings about data removal).
* **Example Layout (Admin Customer Detail)**:

  * Header: “Customer: ACME Corp (John Doe)” – status Active.
  * Left side:

    * **Contact Info** (with edit icon) – shows address, email.
    * **Payment Method** – e.g., “Card on file: Visa \*\*\*\*1111 (exp 12/24) \[Update]”.
  * Right side (taking more width):

    * **Active Subscriptions (2):** list of 2 subs – “Product A – Premium Plan, \$500/mo, Next renewal Oct 1, 2025, Status: Active \[Change Plan] \[Cancel]”. And another row for “Product B – Basic Plan, etc.”.
    * Below that, **Recent Invoices:** maybe last 5 invoices in a table with link “View All Invoices”. Each invoice link opens an invoice detail modal or page.
* This page is critical for support – ensure it loads quickly and has all info to answer customer queries (like “When is my next bill? What plan am I on? Did my last payment succeed?”).
* A snippet from a resource confirms such manage dashboard allows direct edits to subscriptions and an overview of data: *“In the manage dashboard you can view individual customer cards and make direct edits to their subscriptions like updating products, adding one-time upsells, and changing shipping or billing information. ... also view subscriptions in a table view, sorted by next billing date”* – which matches our design.

**Subscriptions Management (Admin List):**

* There might also be a global “Subscriptions” tab where all subscriptions across customers are listed (especially useful to filter, say, all paused subscriptions or all trials).
* Columns: Customer Name, Plan, Status, Next Renewal, Amount, etc.
* Search could search by customer or plan.
* Bulk actions might be limited (maybe none, or for example, filter to paused subs and send bulk email – but likely done via metrics/reporting rather than bulk from here).

**Plans Management (Admin):**

* A section for product managers to manage the subscription plans and pricing.
* This UI lists all plans (Name, Product, Price(s), Status Active/Inactive, perhaps current subscriber count on each).
* Admin can click a plan to edit its details on a Plan Detail page or inline expansion:

  * Edit plan name, description, features (maybe a multi-select of feature options).
  * Edit pricing: likely a list of pricing entries (one per billing term and currency) e.g., “Monthly USD: \$100, Annual USD: \$1080” – editable fields.
  * Set plan as Active/Inactive (with confirm if deactivating).
  * If integrated with promotions, maybe show which promotions apply to this plan currently.
* Ability to create a new plan via a “Create Plan” button which opens a form or modal to enter all fields (as described in Plan Management requirements).
* Possibly manage bundles here as well (could mark certain plans as bundle and allow selecting components).
* Ensure that deactivating a plan warns about existing subs as earlier (with a link or info on how many subscribers).
* The plan management should be restricted to appropriate roles (only product managers or system admins, not support agents).
* Overall, aim for a user-friendly form design – group fields logically (pricing fields together, feature toggles together). Provide guidance text where needed (e.g., “Deactivating a plan will not cancel existing subscriptions but prevents new signups.”).
* The UI changes here should trigger the necessary backend processes (like updating pricing effective immediately for new purchases, logging change).
* Example: A Plan Detail might look like:

  * “Plan: Premium (Product: Software X) \[Active]” with a toggle to deactivate.
  * Features: list of included features with checkboxes (checked features included).
  * Pricing: maybe a sub-table:

    * Billing Period | Price (USD) | Price (EUR) etc.
    * Monthly        |  \$100       | €90
    * Annual         |  \$1,080     | €972
  * Buttons: Save Changes, and perhaps “View Subscribers (count)” to see who is on that plan (for context or communication if changing).
* This interface aligns with needing to easily manage complex plan configurations in a structured way.

**Reporting/Analytics UI (Admin):**

* A “Reports” or “Analytics” section where an admin can view charts and tables of the key metrics described earlier.
* This could be similar to the Dashboard but more detailed or customizable:

  * e.g., a page with multiple tabs: “Revenue”, “Subscribers”, “Churn”, “Trials”.
  * Each tab contains appropriate charts and maybe data tables.
  * There might be filters for date range and product.
  * For example, the “Revenue” tab might show an MRR trend chart and also a table of MRR by month. The “Churn” tab might show churn rate by month and list of canceled subs in the selected range.
  * The UI can leverage chart### Customer Self-Service Portal UI/UX

The **Customer Portal** allows end-users to manage their own subscriptions and account details. Its design should be simple and user-friendly, even for non-technical users:

* **Login/Registration:** Customers authenticate securely (email/password or SSO if integrated). Provide a straightforward signup for new users (if self-service signup is allowed) and a password reset flow via email.

* **Customer Dashboard:** After login, a customer sees a summary of their subscriptions and next billing date/amount. For example, a card might say “Your Premium Plan is active. Next payment of \$100 on Oct 1, 2025.” If they have multiple subscriptions, list each briefly. Show any important alerts (e.g., payment failed – “Action Required: update payment method”).

* **Subscription Management Page:** The customer can click into a specific subscription to see details:

  * Plan name, features, and status (e.g., Trial – ends in 5 days, or Active – renews on X date).

  * Billing history for that subscription (list of past invoices with status paid/unpaid).

  * Actions available:

    * **Upgrade/Downgrade Plan:** If multiple plans are available, provide a way to change plan. Perhaps a “Change Plan” button that opens a selection of available plans (with pricing and features differences) for them to choose. The UI should highlight the benefits of upgrading (e.g., what additional features they get). If they select a new plan, show confirmation of new price and whether it takes effect immediately or at next period.
    * **Update Payment Method:** If this subscription uses a certain card or the default payment method, provide a way to update it (likely by redirecting to a secure payment form to enter new card).
    * **Pause or Cancel:** If pausing is allowed, have a “Pause Subscription” option with an explanation (and perhaps limit selection of pause duration if allowed).
    * **Cancel Subscription:** This should be easy to find but not too easy to accidentally trigger (likely a link or button labeled clearly “Cancel Subscription”). On clicking, show a confirmation dialog explaining what happens (e.g., service will end at period’s end or immediately, and if immediate, whether they’ll lose remaining paid time or get a refund). Possibly ask for a cancellation reason (in a dropdown) to collect feedback.
    * The cancellation flow should be as simple as required by regulations (one-click to cancel is a mandate in some places), so we present the confirm dialog but not force contacting support. If company policy offers a retention offer on cancel attempt, the UI may present it (“Are you sure? Get 20% off for 3 months if you stay ”). But importantly, allow straightforward completion of cancellation if they confirm.

  * If the subscription is canceled or expired, indicate that clearly (and maybe offer a “Reactivate” button if reactivation within grace period is allowed).

* **Account Settings:** A section where customers manage personal info:

  * Update contact email, password, billing/shipping addresses.
  * Manage payment methods on file (add new card, remove card). Possibly set a default card if multiple.
  * Communication preferences (opt in/out of newsletters or promo emails).
  * Download data or delete account (if we expose GDPR tools directly to users). Possibly a button “Request Account Deletion” that triggers a workflow.

* **Billing History:** A page listing all invoices across all subscriptions (or integrate this under account or subscription pages). Each invoice can be viewed/downloaded (PDF). Show status (Paid/Unpaid). If unpaid and within grace, allow a “Pay Now” button for manual payment (if auto-pay failed and they want to pay immediately).

* **Responsive Design:** The portal should work well on mobile so customers can, for instance, update a card or cancel while on a phone. Use a clean layout with maybe cards for each subscription on mobile stacked vertically.

* **Visual Design:** Friendly and branded in line with the company's product. Likely simpler than admin portal (which is more data-dense). Possibly use icons or progress indicators (e.g., trial progress bar showing days left). Use color coding: e.g., **green** for active/good standing, **orange** for needs attention (expiring card, dunning), **red** for canceled or payment failed states – but always with text labels too, not color alone.

* **Example Customer Portal Flow:** Jane logs in and sees “Welcome Jane. You have 2 active subscriptions.” She clicks her “Project Management Pro” subscription. She sees details: “Pro Plan – \$50/month – Next payment Oct 1.” Below that a list of past payments. She notices her credit card on file expires next month, so an alert says “Your card expires soon – please update.” She clicks “Update Payment Method,” enters new card info in a secure form (provided by gateway), and the UI shows “Card updated successfully.” She decides to upgrade to the Premium plan. She hits “Change Plan,” a comparison of Pro vs Premium is shown (with Premium’s extra features). She confirms upgrade; a confirmation says “Upgraded! Your new rate is \$80/month effective immediately. Prorated charge \$15 has been applied (see invoice).” The UI reflects her plan as Premium now. Later, she wants to cancel another subscription – she clicks cancel, sees an offer or at least a confirm “Are you sure? You will lose access to X features. \[Yes, cancel]”. She confirms, the button changes to “Canceled – ends Nov 30” and she knows it will stop then. An email confirmation of cancellation is sent to her.

The customer UI must emphasize **transparency (show what they’re paying for and when) and control (easy-to-find options to make changes)**. By following these UX requirements, the portal will reduce support load (customers can self-service) and increase trust (because information is clearly presented and actions do what the user expects).

### Data Model and Database Requirements

The platform’s data model will be structured to maintain referential integrity, support the required functionality, and allow efficient queries. Key entities and their relationships include:

* **Customer (Account):** Represents an individual or organization subscribing to services. Key fields:

  * `customer_id` (PK),
  * personal or company name,
  * contact info (email, phone),
  * billing address, shipping address,
  * status (active, deleted),
  * creation\_date,
  * any segmentation or metadata (e.g., industry, customer type).
  * Relationships: One customer **can have many** subscriptions. One customer can have multiple payment methods (so one-to-many to PaymentMethod table).
* **User:** If internal users (admins) and customers share the system’s auth model or not. Often separate tables:

  * Customers login with `customer_accounts` whereas internal `admin_users` table for staff. We will likely separate them for clarity. But both need secure credentials and role info.
* **Subscription:** Represents an active (or past) subscription of a customer to a plan.

  * Fields:

    * `subscription_id` (PK),
    * `customer_id` (FK to Customer),
    * `plan_id` (FK to Plan) – or possibly a direct embed of plan details if plan can change (we’ll use FK plus plan history for changes),
    * `status` (active, trial, paused, canceled, etc. – could also store trial flag and pause info separately),
    * `start_date`,
    * `end_date` (if fixed term or cancellation effective date),
    * `next_renewal_date` (if auto-renewing),
    * `quantity` (if plan allows multiple units, e.g., number of licenses – if applicable),
    * `custom_price` (if a custom override is set for this sub; null otherwise means use standard plan price),
    * `billing_period` (e.g., monthly, annual – could link to a separate BillingTerm or simply a field like interval + interval\_count),
    * `trial_end_date` (if in trial; null if not),
    * `pause_end_date` (if paused).
    * Possibly `contract_end_date` for multi-year deals.
  * Relationships: Many subscriptions belong to one customer. Each subscription relates to one plan (though if it's a bundle, perhaps it can link to a special “Bundle Plan” and/or have child records for components). One subscription can have many invoices over time (one per billing period typically).
  * We may also have a `plan_history` table: each record has `subscription_id`, `plan_id`, `date_start`, `date_end` to track plan changes over time.
* **Plan:** Represents a subscription plan offering.

  * Fields:

    * `plan_id` (PK),
    * name, description,
    * product or service category (if multiple products),
    * allowed billing frequencies (maybe a separate table PlanPricing for each term),
    * status (active/inactive),
    * feature set reference (could link to a separate PlanFeatures table or just description).
    * Perhaps `user_group_type` or max users if relevant (like if plan defines how many seats).
  * Relationships: Many subscriptions can reference one plan. A plan can have multiple entries in a PlanPricing table (one for monthly, one for annual, etc.). If we implement plan options, separate Option table and join table `option_included(plan_id, option_id)`.
* **Pricing/PlanPricing:** (If not embedding in Plan) A table for pricing options per plan:

  * Fields: `plan_id` (FK), `billing_interval` (e.g., monthly, annual), `price` (numeric), `currency`.
  * Composite PK on (plan\_id, interval, currency).
  * This allows quick lookup of price when generating invoice by matching plan and term. It also allows storing promotional or tiered pricing if needed by adding more fields (like min\_quantity, price\_per\_unit for usage tiers in future).
* **Invoice:** Represents a billing invoice generated.

  * Fields:

    * `invoice_id` (PK),
    * `customer_id` (FK) – invoice is for a customer (could cover multiple subs if consolidated),
    * optionally `subscription_id` (FK) if invoice is specific to one sub (for simplicity we might link each invoice to one subscription; if we consolidate, one invoice could cover multiple subs, in which case we won’t use subscription\_id here but derive from line items),
    * `invoice_date`,
    * `due_date`,
    * `paid_date`,
    * `status` (Paid, Open, Past Due, Canceled, etc.),
    * `subtotal_amount`, `tax_amount`, `total_amount` (store totals for record; can be derived from lines but stored for quick access and to freeze values at time of issue),
    * `currency`,
    * `payment_method_id` used (if known at invoice, maybe not needed).
  * Relationships: Invoice has many line items (InvoiceLine table) for each charge component (plan fee, proration, discount, tax). Also an invoice can have at most one Payment record (or multiple if partial payments allowed).
* **InvoiceLine:** Itemized charges on an invoice.

  * Fields:

    * `invoice_id` (FK),
    * `description` (e.g., “Premium Plan – October 2025” or “VAT 20%”),
    * `amount` (could be negative for credits/discounts),
    * possibly `subscription_id` or `plan_id` if line ties to a specific subscription or plan (for correlation),
    * `quantity` if applicable,
    * `tax_rate` or code if a tax line.
  * Primary key might be composite of (invoice\_id, line\_number). Storing description and amount locks in the charge at time of billing.
* **Payment (Transaction):** Records a payment transaction attempt or completion.

  * Fields:

    * `payment_id` (PK),
    * `invoice_id` (FK, if payment is tied to a specific invoice – typically yes for our use),
    * `amount`,
    * `payment_date`,
    * `status` (Success, Failed, Refunded, etc.),
    * `gateway` (e.g., Stripe),
    * `gateway_transaction_id` (so we can reconcile with gateway records),
    * `payment_method_id` (FK to PaymentMethod used, if available),
    * `error_message` (if failed, store reason code or message).
  * Relationships: Payment belongs to one invoice (in one-to-many sense one invoice could have multiple payments if partial or retries; but typically one invoice has one full payment or one payment and possibly a refund associated).
  * We will have a **Refund** either as a negative Payment entry referencing the invoice or a flag on Payment if it’s a partial refund – better to create a new Payment record with negative amount or type=refund, linking to original payment or invoice.
* **PaymentMethod:** Stores a customer’s saved payment details (tokenized).

  * Fields:

    * `payment_method_id` (PK),
    * `customer_id` (FK),
    * `type` (CreditCard, ACH, PayPal, etc.),
    * details: e.g., `card_last4`, `card_brand`, `expiry_month`, `expiry_year` for cards,
    * `billing_name` and `billing_address` if needed,
    * `gateway_token` (the token or ID from payment gateway vault),
    * `is_default` (boolean).
  * Security: no sensitive PAN or CVV stored – we keep only last4 and token. Possibly encrypt the token if needed (though token itself is usually useless outside gateway context).
  * A customer can have many payment methods stored, with one default used for auto-billing.
* **Promotion (Coupon):**

  * Fields:

    * `promotion_id` (PK),
    * `code` (unique string, null if it's an auto-applied promotion),
    * `discount_type` (percent or fixed),
    * `discount_value`,
    * `duration` (once, N months, forever),
    * `max_redemptions` (limit usage count),
    * `valid_from`, `valid_until` (date range of validity),
    * `applies_to_plan` (FK to Plan or null if applies to all plans or a category),
    * maybe `applies_to_billing_period` (e.g., only monthly plans),
    * `current_redemptions` (how many times used so far),
    * `status` (active, expired).
  * When a code is used by a customer, we might have a join table like `PromotionRedemption (promotion_id, customer_id, subscription_id, redemption_date)` to record each usage, ensure one per customer if needed, and prevent reuse beyond allowed.
* **AuditLog:** (For internal tracking of changes)

  * Fields: `log_id`, `timestamp`, `user_id` (admin who did action, or system), `action` (text like “UPDATED\_PLAN\_PRICE”), `details` (perhaps JSON or text describing what changed).
  * Possibly separate tables for specific audit types as needed, but a general log table is straightforward.

These are the core tables. The model supports the functionality:

* The relationships enforce constraints (e.g., can’t have a subscription without a valid customer and plan).
* Use foreign keys for referential integrity (with cascade deletes carefully handled: typically, do not delete customers or plans if they have child records; instead, mark inactive to preserve history).
* **Example Data:**

  * A customer ACME (id 100) has subscription id 500 to Plan id 10 (Premium Plan). In Subscription table: customer\_id=100, plan\_id=10, status=Active, next\_renewal=2025-10-01, billing\_period="Monthly".
  * Invoices table might have invoice id 900 for subscription\_id=500 (or customer\_id=100, and invoice lines linking to subscription 500), invoice\_date=2025-09-01, total=100, paid\_date=2025-09-01. Payment table shows payment id 800 linked to invoice 900, amount=100, status=Success, gateway\_txn=XYZ.
  * If ACME upgrades plan on 2025-09-15: We add plan\_history entry for sub 500 indicating plan change from 10 to 11 on that date. Create an invoice 901 for proration (covering 09-15 to 10-01 difference), invoice\_line1: “Upgrade to Premium+ for remaining 16 days” \$ amount, line2: maybe credit from old plan. Payment recorded and invoice 901 marked paid.
  * If ACME had a promo code, PromotionRedemption logs that ACME used code "HOLIDAY2025" (id 30) on subscription 500 redemption\_date...
* **Scalability considerations:** The design is in 3NF for main entities, which works for the expected volume (thousands to tens of thousands of records). If we had millions, partitioning or indexing is needed but the structure stands. Using numeric surrogate PKs and proper indexing on foreign keys (customer\_id on Subscription, etc.) is mandatory for performance.
* **Flexibility:** The model can accommodate future needs:

  * If we add usage-based billing, we’d add a UsageRecord table (sub\_id, date, quantity) and then modify invoice generation to include usage lines.
  * If we support multi-tenant SaaS (multiple vendor clients), we'd add a Tenant table and tenant\_id foreign keys to Customers, Plans, etc., isolating each tenant’s data.
  * If we add more payment types (ACH), PaymentMethod table already can store type-specific fields.
* **Integrity rules:**

  * If a subscription is canceled, no further invoice generation tasks will be scheduled for it; it might have an end\_date to indicate service until end of paid period.
  * If a plan is retired (inactive), we might still allow existing subs to reference it (so don’t remove plan, just mark inactive).
  * Use database constraints where possible (e.g., an invoice line amount plus tax lines sum to invoice total – not enforced by constraint easily, but at least ensure no orphaned invoice lines without invoice).
  * **Cascade deletion:** Typically we avoid deleting key records. We will not delete Customer records with subscriptions – GDPR deletion would anonymize instead of physical delete to maintain referential links to invoices (which we must keep for financial records). We may set ON DELETE CASCADE for convenience on some supporting tables (like if a promotion is deleted, also drop PromotionRedemption entries; but normally we also wouldn’t delete promotions that were used, we’d mark them expired).

In essence, the database structure is carefully planned to support all subscription operations, ensure data consistency (each invoice line ties to a subscription/plan so we know what was billed), and enable the generation of the analytics we need (because data is relational, we can query totals, counts, group by plan, etc. easily using SQL). It is also extensible to new features by adding related tables or columns without major refactoring.

*(Appendix C could include an Entity-Relationship Diagram or table schema snippet for clarity. For example, a simplified ERD might show: Customer --< Subscription >-- Plan; Subscription --< Invoice --< InvoiceLine; Customer --< PaymentMethod; Invoice --< Payment. Such a diagram, if drawn, would illustrate the foreign key relationships described above.)*

### APIs and Integration Points

The platform will expose a set of **APIs** to enable integration with other systems and to drive the front-end UIs. All APIs will be secured and documented for intended use. Integration points with external services (payment gateway, tax service, email, etc.) are also a crucial part of the system.

**Internal/External APIs:**

* **RESTful API Endpoints:** The backend will provide REST (or JSON-over-HTTP) APIs for all major data operations. These APIs serve two purposes: powering the web portals (admin and customer portal make AJAX calls to them) and allowing external integration (e.g., the company’s main product might call these to create a subscription when a user signs up in-app).

  * Endpoints will be structured logically, e.g.:

    * `POST /api/customers` to create a new customer,
    * `GET /api/customers/{id}` to retrieve customer info,
    * `PUT /api/customers/{id}` to update,
    * `GET /api/customers/{id}/subscriptions` to list subscriptions for a customer.
    * Similar endpoints for subscriptions (`/subscriptions/{id}` for get/update; or `/customers/{id}/subscriptions` for create under a customer).
    * `/plans` endpoints to list available plans (for use in plan selection UIs or if a sales portal needs it).
    * `/invoices` endpoints to query invoice data or mark payment (though payment posting is usually via webhooks rather than an API call).
    * Auth will be required (likely token in header or cookie). Customers and admin users will have different scopes.
    * The API will validate and respond with appropriate HTTP status codes (200 success, 400 for bad request, 401/403 for auth issues, 500 for server errors).
    * The API should handle concurrency issues (e.g., if two requests try to update same resource, use locking or version fields to avoid conflict).
  * **Customer-facing API:** Possibly minimal (customers typically use the portal UI, not direct API calls). But if offering an integration to enterprise clients, maybe allow them to use an API to pull their own data or manage subs (with API keys).
  * **Admin-facing API:** Used by admin front-end. We might also expose an admin API for integration with internal tools (like data pipeline or custom automation scripts).
* **Authentication/Authorization for API:** Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for external API access. For instance, issue JWT tokens on login (with claims for role and user). For integrations, possibly use API keys or OAuth client credentials for server-to-server. Ensure these tokens have scopes (like a token might be scoped to only read data vs modify).
* **Rate Limiting:** For external API use (like if exposing to customers or third-parties), implement rate limits to prevent abuse. E.g., max 1000 calls per hour per API key. This will be at API gateway or app level. Internal use (our UI) can be exempt or have higher limits.
* **API Documentation:** Provide a clear API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) for any third-party integrators or internal developers. This should describe endpoints, request/response schemas, auth requirements, and examples.

**Integration with Payment Gateway:** (summarizing earlier details)

* The platform will integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) for processing payments and storing payment details. This integration is via the gateway’s API using secret keys. Core integration points:

  * **Tokenization**: Use Stripe Elements (front-end) or similar so card data is converted to a token in the browser and only the token is sent to our server. Our server then calls Stripe to exchange the token for a saved PaymentMethod (customer vault record) and associates it with the customer (we call `POST /customer` to Stripe, then `POST /payment_method` attach).
  * **Charging**: When an invoice is due, our system creates a Charge via the gateway API for the invoice amount against the stored payment method. We include relevant metadata (invoice ID, customer ID) in the charge for traceability. We handle the response: if success, mark paid; if declines, handle according to dunning plan.
  * **Webhooks**: We will register a webhook endpoint (e.g., `/api/webhooks/payment`) with the gateway to receive asynchronous events. For example, Stripe sends events like `invoice.payment_failed`, `charge.succeeded`, `charge.refunded`. Our endpoint will verify the event’s signature (to ensure it’s really from Stripe) and then update our records:

    * On payment failed: mark invoice as failed and trigger dunning (if not already handled by our immediate response logic).
    * On charge succeeded (especially useful for off-session charges): mark payment as succeeded.
    * On refund: mark the payment or invoice as refunded and possibly create a record for it.
  * **Recurring Billing via Gateway vs System**: We have a choice: let our system orchestrate all charges (likely this approach) or use gateway’s recurring subscription feature (e.g., Stripe Billing). We lean on our system for full control: our system will create charges each period (or use gateway’s subscription but then we lose some control). The chosen design is our system does scheduling and just uses gateway for actual charge execution, which aligns with our need to handle custom proration, etc., and track MRR precisely.
  * **PCI Compliance**: Because we do not handle raw card data (tokenization in browser) and use stored tokens, our integration method keeps us within a lower PCI scope (SAQ A-EP or similar). The gateway’s API communication is over HTTPS with secret keys. We ensure keys are secure and rotated if needed.
  * The gateway integration code is abstracted so if we needed to switch to a different gateway (Braintree, etc.), we implement the same interface for that gateway. We might support multiple concurrently (some customers pay via Stripe, others via PayPal – possible but we'd plan accordingly with PaymentMethod type field distinguishing).
* **Integration with Tax Calculation Service:**

  * If using an external tax service like Avalara, our system calls Avalara’s API when invoices are being created. For example, our Billing module sends `customer location, line items, amounts` to Avalara’s `CreateTransaction` API and gets back tax details. We then create corresponding InvoiceLine for tax. We likely also “commit” the transaction in Avalara so it’s recorded for tax filing.
  * If Avalara is down or not configured, our fallback may be simple tax rules (e.g., a flat rate or no tax for certain regions). Admins can set tax rates per region in settings (and our code will apply those).
  * Integration must handle tax exemptions: if a customer has provided tax exemption (e.g., non-profit certificate), our system should mark them as tax-exempt (perhaps a field on Customer or PaymentMethod). Our tax API call would then mark the transaction as exempt or skip tax calculation for them.
  * The tax service creds (API keys) are stored securely. The integration should log any failures and proceed without blocking billing (maybe issue invoice without tax and flag for later correction if service is unreachable, depending on business preference).
* **Email/SMS Service Integration:**

  * We will use an email API (like SendGrid’s send email endpoint) to send transactional emails (welcome, invoices, dunning notices). The Notification module formats the content (perhaps using templates stored in the database or code) and calls the email API with appropriate parameters (to, subject, body).
  * We’ll include dynamic info (e.g., invoice PDF link or details). Optionally, we could use the email service’s templating feature to manage templates on their side and just pass data.
  * We need to handle email API responses: e.g., if send fails (we will log and possibly retry via queue logic).
  * Similarly for SMS (if we decide to send reminders via text), integrate with an SMS gateway (Twilio, etc.) by calling their API with phone number and message.
  * Ensure compliance in communications: include unsubscribe link in any marketing emails (for now mostly transactional emails which don't require unsubscribe by law, but we might still allow opting out of certain notifications via preferences).
* **CRM Integration (internal or external):**

  * If sales uses Salesforce, for instance, we may sync customer and subscription data to SF. Potential approaches:

    * Use Salesforce’s REST API: e.g., when a subscription is created or canceled, our system (perhaps via a background job) calls SF’s API to update a corresponding object (Account or Opportunity).
    * Or use middleware like Zapier or Mulesoft – not part of our system but our system provides webhook endpoints or data needed.
    * At minimum, our platform can export data that can be imported to CRM periodically.
  * Because each company’s CRM usage differs, likely this integration will be somewhat custom for the client. The system’s API or direct DB access (through read replica) can facilitate building these pipelines externally.
  * We ensure that we have unique identifiers that can match (like use customer email or an integration ID to match records in CRM).
* **Accounting Integration:**

  * We can provide an **export of financial records** (invoices, payments) that can be imported into accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero).
  * If needed, use their APIs: e.g., push each paid invoice as a “Sale” in QuickBooks via QuickBooks Online API, marking the customer and amount.
  * Alternatively, generate a monthly summary or a journal entry export. This depends on what accounting requires; our system’s primary job is to produce accurate transactional data, then finance might handle it manually or via a script.
  * The architecture allows connecting another service or script to the database (or via API) to fetch needed data. Possibly we implement a "QuickBooks Integration" toggle that, if on, triggers a job whenever an invoice is paid to send it to QuickBooks through their SDK.
* **Webhook Support for Clients:**

  * We might allow our *clients* (if we offer platform as SaaS to others, or even the company’s main product) to subscribe to webhooks from our system. For example, the company’s main app might want to know when a user’s subscription status changes (so it can enable/disable features in the app).
  * So we implement outbound webhooks: the admin can configure a URL on a customer account or globally that receives events (e.g., “SUBSCRIPTION\_CANCELED” with customer ID and sub ID). We sign these webhook payloads and require the receiver to verify like we do for Stripe.
  * This decouples the main product from directly polling our API constantly. Instead, our system proactively notifies it of changes.
  * We will queue and retry webhooks if the client’s endpoint is down, to ensure reliable delivery (with some limit).
* **API Rate limiting and security:**

  * For public API keys we might provide to clients, we will enforce rate limits as noted. Also, CORS settings for our API might allow the company’s domains to call it (for portal integration, etc.) but generally lock it down (the admin portal and customer portal are same origin or allowed origins).
  * All external API calls will require HTTPS and proper auth; internal calls (between modules) are not exposed externally.
  * Logging of API calls (especially admin API usage) with user info for audit in case of misuse.
* **Example API Usage:**

  * The company’s website might use the API to implement a pricing page signup form: when user fills out details and submits, the website’s backend calls `POST /customers` then `POST /customers/{id}/subscriptions` to create a trial subscription, then directs user to the product. The API responds with JSON of the created records which the website uses to confirm signup success. Meanwhile, our platform sends out welcome email via email integration. This demonstrates how the API enables integration with front-end beyond our provided UI.
  * Another example: a nightly job in finance runs a Python script that uses our API with an admin token to GET `/reports/mrr?date=2025-09-30` and `/reports/churn?month=2025-09` to pull metrics and populate an internal spreadsheet. Our API provides those aggregated endpoints or raw data endpoints (it could also pull from the database directly, but API gives a stable contract).

In summary, the system provides robust API endpoints for both **internal consumption (UI)** and **external integration**, secured with proper auth and rate limits. It integrates smoothly with key external services: **payment gateways** for secure payment processing, **tax services** to stay compliant with tax calculations, **email/SMS** for user notifications, and is capable of tying into CRMs and accounting systems to fit into the company’s broader IT ecosystem. These integration points ensure the subscription platform does not operate in isolation but rather complements and exchanges data with other enterprise systems as needed.

### User Roles and Access Control

The platform will implement a granular **user role and access control** system to ensure that each user (whether an internal team member or a customer) can only access data and functions appropriate to their role. The key user roles and their permissions include:

* **System Administrator:** Top-level internal role with full access. Permissions:

  * Manage other user accounts and roles (create/edit admin users).
  * Configure system settings (e.g., API keys for integrations, global defaults).
  * Full read/write on all customer and subscription data. Can create, modify, or delete any record (though deletion of customer data may be limited to special processes).
  * Can manage plans and pricing (including creating/editing plans).
  * Essentially unrestricted – this role is for a small number of trusted individuals.
* **Billing Manager/Finance:** Internal role focused on financial operations. Permissions:

  * View all customers, subscriptions, invoices, and payments.
  * Modify billing info: e.g., apply payments, issue refunds, manage dunning.
  * Create and edit subscriptions and plans? Possibly yes for finance leads or product managers. (We might have separate roles for product manager vs finance, but there's overlap).
  * Likely can not manage system users or core configurations (no access to user management or system settings).
  * Example: A Billing Manager can update a customer’s payment method, adjust a subscription's custom price (if allowed by process), generate an invoice on-demand, or cancel a subscription per customer request.
* **Support/Customer Service Agent:** Internal role for support staff who assist customers. Permissions:

  * View customer and subscription details (read-only for most fields).
  * Perform basic actions on behalf of customer: e.g., cancel a subscription at customer request, pause it, or initiate a plan change (possibly need a higher confirmation).
  * They should **not** be able to change pricing or see sensitive financial settings beyond what's needed. They see invoices and can resend them, but might not issue arbitrary credits without approval (maybe not allowed to create custom credits, only apply existing policies).
  * Possibly hide certain fields from them – e.g., they can see last4 of card to confirm identity but they cannot see full card or export all data.
  * They cannot manage plans or other customers beyond usage. Essentially can do what a customer can do (and maybe a bit more, like extended retention offers) for any customer, to assist them.
  * They cannot create or delete customers (they handle existing ones).
* **Sales/Account Executive:** Internal role focusing on sales and enterprise accounts. Permissions:

  * Read access to customers and subscriptions, especially prospective or assigned accounts.
  * Might have ability to create new customer accounts or subscriptions (for example, inputting an order that came in via a sales contract).
  * Possibly can create custom deals: e.g., initiate a subscription with a custom price or longer term (maybe flagged for manager approval).
  * Should not have access to high-level settings or other customers beyond their territory (if applicable).
  * E.g., a sales rep might log in to create a new enterprise customer and set them up with a certain plan and mark it as a 2-year contract at special rate (perhaps requiring finance to finalize).
* **Product Manager:** (If distinct from sysadmin) Role to manage plans/promotions:

  * Can create/edit **Plan** configurations and **Promotion codes**.
  * View aggregate metrics and reports.
  * Not necessarily dive into individual customer billing, but likely they have read access to most data for analysis.
  * They may not need ability to manage user accounts or payment operations.
* **Read-Only Analyst/Auditor:** (Optional) A role for someone who needs to view data but not change it (e.g., an external auditor or a finance analyst).

  * They can view all records and export data but cannot modify anything.
  * Ensures compliance that if an auditor account is created, it cannot accidentally change something.
* **Customer (Portal User):** External role for customers. Permissions:

  * Only access their own account data (the system enforces customer\_id matching on all queries).
  * Manage their own subscriptions (upgrade/downgrade, cancel, etc. as allowed), view their invoices, update profile/payment.
  * They cannot see other customers’ data or any internal info.
  * They do not see admin-only fields (like internal notes or cost rates).
  * If a customer is also an admin for their organization (in case of B2B2B scenario), we might have levels among customers, but our context seems direct B2B with one entity per account.
* **Role-Based UI:** The front-end will tailor navigation and options based on role:

  * An admin sees the full admin portal menu (Customers, Subscriptions, Plans, Reports, Settings, etc.).
  * A support agent might see only Customers, Subscriptions, maybe Reports (some metrics) but not Settings.
  * A customer sees the customer portal only, which is entirely separate.
  * If we use a unified login system, roles determine which app section they go to (but likely we separate the portals and they have different login endpoints).
* **Access Control Implementation:**

  * Each API endpoint and page will check the user’s role/permissions. For example, the “Delete Plan” API requires role = SystemAdmin or ProductManager and will 403 forbid if a Support agent token calls it.
  * We may use a permissions matrix or claims: e.g., JWT token might carry roles or specific permissions (like “can\_refund”: true).
  * Key sensitive actions might even have secondary confirmations for safety (e.g., deleting a plan or issuing a large refund could require a second factor or elevated privilege).
  * The system will ensure that even if a lower-role user tries to access an unauthorized resource (by manipulating an ID in URL or API call), the backend will prevent it. For instance, Support attempting to edit plan pricing will be blocked server-side (not just hidden in UI).
  * Database queries will sometimes need to enforce role too: e.g., an admin can query all customers, but a sales rep might have a filter (maybe assigned accounts only – implementing that would require an assignment mapping or territory concept).
  * Use of **multi-tenant**: If in future multiple companies use same instance, each admin also has a tenant scope which further restricts data. But in our scenario, roles are mostly about function, not data separation (except each customer only their data).
* **User Management Interface:** System Admins will have a UI to create new internal users, assign roles, reset passwords. They can also deactivate users (important for security when staff leave). This interface ensures compliance with principle of least privilege by letting us assign minimal role needed.
* **Auditing and Compliance:** All role-based access should be auditable: log whenever an admin user of role Support views or exports large sets of data (so we can trace potential insider misuse). Also log permission failures (someone tried to do something not allowed) as a warning in audit log (could indicate a mischief or need to adjust roles).
* **Example Role Use Case:** A Support agent logs in and searches a customer. They can see subscription status and help the customer cancel or update card (they have a button “Send Update Payment Link” maybe or walk them through doing it themselves). But the support agent cannot see the “Plan Management” section, and if they somehow navigate to a plan URL, the system will deny access. A Product Manager logs in and goes to “Plans” to add a new plan or adjust pricing. Only she and other PMs see that section. A System Admin can do everything, including adding a new Support user account for a new hire.

The roles and permissions design ensures **separation of duties** (e.g., support can’t alter pricing, finance can’t edit product settings) and protects sensitive operations from being performed by those without clearance. It also minimizes risk if an account is compromised – e.g., if a support user account were hacked, the attacker couldn’t change system configurations or dump the entire database via admin features. This layered access control is critical for security and compliance.

\*(Appendix D could include a table of roles and their permissions for quick reference, for instance:

| Role              | Permissions (examples)                                                                                                                      |     |

| Sales Rep         | Create/view customers and subs (perhaps limited to assigned deals); cannot delete or issue refunds, etc.                                    |     |
| Product Manager   | Manage plans and promotions; view metrics; read customer data (no payment operations).                                                      |     |
| Read-Only Analyst | View/export all data; no modifications allowed.                                                                                             |     |

### Payment Gateway Integration

The platform’s integration with the payment gateway is crucial for processing payments reliably and securely. As detailed earlier, we will integrate with a leading payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) to handle tokenization, charges, and recurring payments. The requirements for this integration include:

* **Secure Tokenization of Card Data:** The customer portal will use the payment gateway’s secure checkout or JavaScript library to capture card details directly. This means raw card data (PAN, CVV) **never hits our servers**. Instead, the gateway returns a token or payment method ID representing the card. Our system then uses this token for future charges. This approach keeps us out of scope for handling sensitive card info and ensures PCI compliance.
* **Storing Customer Payment Profiles:** Through the gateway API, when a user adds a payment method, we attach it to a customer profile in the gateway vault. Our database will store the gateway’s customer ID and the token for the payment method (along with last4, brand, expiry for display). If a customer has multiple methods, we store each token. All sensitive details remain with the gateway.
* **Recurring Charge Workflow:** For each billing cycle, our system (or the gateway’s subscription mechanism if used) will initiate the charge:

  * Option 1 (our system in control): Our **Billing module** calculates the amount due and then calls the gateway’s charge/create payment API with the customer’s token and amount. On success, the gateway returns a transaction ID which we record in our Payment record. If it fails (card declined, etc.), we record failure and trigger dunning.
  * Option 2 (gateway’s subscription feature): Alternatively, we could create a Subscription object in the gateway with an interval and price, and let the gateway charge automatically each cycle, then send us webhooks. However, since we have custom proration, upgrades, and multi-item invoices, we likely prefer Option 1 for flexibility.
  * We will likely implement Option 1: we handle scheduling and call **Stripe Charge API** for each invoice. This gives us fine-grained control to apply proration credits, multiple line items, etc., building a consolidated charge (Stripe allows passing an array of line items or just one total amount).
* **Handling Payment Failures (Dunning):** When the gateway returns a decline for a charge attempt, our system:

  * Marks the invoice as payment failed.
  * The Dunning process (internal) schedules retries. The integration with gateway will be used for retries as well (just call the charge API again after some days). We may use the gateway’s built-in retry rules as well if they have that feature (some have configurable retry attempts) for safety, but we’ll also track it.
  * If a customer updates their card during dunning, the next scheduled attempt will use the new token (so update the PaymentMethod on file and use new token for retry).
  * For certain failures like “card expired” or “insufficient funds,” we notify the customer via email (and possibly SMS) to update card or ensure funds.
  * If after final attempt fails, we integrate this with subscription status update (cancel or move to delinquent status).
* **Refunds:** When an admin issues a refund (full or partial), our system will call the gateway’s refund API referencing the original transaction ID. The gateway processes the refund and our system updates the Payment record status to “Refunded” and creates an entry for the refund (maybe separate negative Payment record or flag on original). We also trigger an email to customer that refund was issued (with amount and it may take X days to appear on their statement).
* **Webhooks from Gateway:** We will set up the gateway to send webhook events to our system (to a dedicated endpoint secure with secret):

  * This ensures we are notified of events like a charge succeeded (useful if we let gateway subscription handle recurring billing) or a charge failed (in case our call missed it or in gateway-run scenario).
  * The gateway might also send events like “customer disputed a charge” (chargeback) – our webhook handler would log that and alert an admin to handle externally.
  * We verify webhook signatures for security.
  * For example, **Stripe** sends an event when a payment intent fails or succeeds. Even though we get immediate response from API calls, webhooks are a second source of truth we can use to reconcile or catch asynchronous events (like if using Stripe’s subscription object or if a bank dispute happens).
* **PCI DSS Compliance Measures via Gateway:**

  * The gateway is PCI Level 1 certified, so by forwarding card handling to it, we significantly reduce our PCI burden. We still must implement secure integration: always use HTTPS for API calls, store API keys securely, restrict who can view card tokens in our system (not that the token is sensitive like a PAN, but treat it carefully).
  * Our integration will adhere to the gateway’s recommended security practices. For Stripe, that means using their libraries (which handle encryption in transit) and not logging secret keys or full webhook contents with sensitive info.
  * We will fill out PCI SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire) A-EP or D as appropriate, and the integration design (tokenization, encryption, access control) will help us answer those controls positively.
* **Alternate Payment Methods:** The integration is designed to accommodate additional methods:

  * E.g., if offering **PayPal**, we’d integrate with PayPal API (customer might click PayPal checkout which returns a token or agreement ID to our system). We’d store that as a PaymentMethod type PayPal and use PayPal APIs for charging/refunding. The system design is abstract enough to handle multiple types (the PaymentMethod table `type` field and Payment processing module would have separate flows per type).
  * If offering **Direct Debit (ACH/SEPA)**, similar approach: use gateway’s support for ACH (Stripe supports ACH debits and has verification steps). Our system would handle the slightly different flow (like micro-deposit verification) possibly via additional UI for customers. But core charge and schedule logic remains similar once verified.
* **Performance and Reliability of Integration:**

  * The system will make synchronous API calls for payments in real-time (while generating an invoice). We need to handle gateway latency gracefully: if the charge API takes 2 seconds, our request might wait or we might decide to use asynchronous approach (e.g., immediately mark invoice pending and let a background job complete the charge and update later). For user-initiated immediate payments (like at sign-up or manual “Pay Now”), they expect a quick response, so we might do it inline but show a spinner in UI and have a reasonable timeout with user feedback if it’s taking long.
  * Use idempotency keys when making charge calls to avoid double-charging in case of network issues (Stripe provides idempotency-key header).
  * Implement retry logic for gateway calls carefully: e.g., if a charge API call fails due to network error (no response), we need to confirm with gateway (maybe via retrieving payment intent status) to avoid duplicate charges. Using idempotency keys or storing a pending payment state with a unique ID solves this.
  * Ensure that if our system or gateway is down, transactions queue and recover. For instance, if gateway is temporarily unreachable, the system might queue the charge request and try shortly after (so it doesn’t just drop it).
* **Testing the Integration:** We will use gateway’s test mode to simulate various scenarios (success, declines, exceptions) during QA, and ensure our system responds correctly (creating records, triggering emails, etc.). Also test webhooks in test mode.
* **Audit and Logging:** We will log all interactions with the gateway for audit purposes (not sensitive data but events). E.g., log “Attempted charge \$100 for invoice 123 via Stripe for customer 456 – Success, TransactionID=ch\_1ABC...” or failure reason code. These logs help debug payment issues and provide evidence for compliance audits if needed (Requirement 10 of PCI: track all access to cardholder data environment – our gateway interactions log is part of that control).

By integrating with the payment gateway as described, the platform ensures secure and reliable payment processing that meets industry standards. All sensitive payment data is handled by the gateway and referenced in our system by tokens, preserving security while allowing our system to perform the necessary billing operations. This integration is a critical backbone for the subscription lifecycle (enabling automated renewals, easy customer payments, and efficient handling of payment problems) and has been designed with both user experience and stringent security/compliance requirements in mind.

### Auditing and Logging

Auditing and logging are implemented to provide transparency, assist in troubleshooting, and fulfill compliance requirements. The platform will maintain detailed logs of system events and user actions, and offer mechanisms to review those logs:

* **Audit Log of User Actions:** Every critical action performed by an internal user (admin, support, etc.) should be recorded in an **audit log** entry. This includes:

  * Creating, editing, or deleting customer accounts.
  * Creating or changing subscriptions (e.g., upgrades, cancellations, pauses).
  * Changes to plan configurations or prices.
  * Manual billing operations like issuing a refund or marking a payment.
  * Changes to system settings or user roles.
  * The audit entry will record: **timestamp, user ID, action performed, target entity (e.g., subscription ID or customer ID), and a description of the change**. For changes, it should ideally record the before and after values of key fields if applicable (e.g., “Plan price changed from \$100 to \$120” or “Subscription status changed from Trial to Active”).
  * For example, if a support agent cancels a subscription for customer X, the log might say: “2025-09-10 14:23:45 – User #12 (SupportAgent) – CANCELED Subscription #457 for Customer #1003 – reason: user request.” This log can be later reviewed to confirm who did it and why.
  * These logs will be immutable (the system should not allow deletion or alteration of audit logs via UI; only possible via direct DB by admins, which will be avoided). Perhaps store in append-only table or external log system to ensure integrity.
* **System Event Logs:** The system will produce logs for system-level events:

  * **Security events:** login attempts (successful and failed) – record user, time, IP, and reason if failed (e.g., wrong password). Also record logout or session expiration events.
  * **Integration events:** interactions with external services (calls to payment gateway, webhook received, email sent). E.g., log “Stripe webhook event payment\_failed received for Invoice 789, processed – subscription marked past due.”
  * **Errors/Exceptions:** All application errors should be logged with stack trace and context. These are in server logs for developers to debug (not exposed to end users).
  * **Performance issues:** If we have monitoring, log queries that exceed a threshold or other unusual activity.
* **Log Storage and Management:**

  * Application and audit logs will be stored in a persistent way. Possibly in a separate logging database or in files that are rotated and archived.
  * We might use a cloud logging service or SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) to centralize logs across application servers and database. This helps in analysis and is often needed for SOC2/PCI evidence.
  * Logs containing sensitive data: ensure we do not log full credit card numbers, passwords, or excessive PII. Mask where necessary. For example, log “Card token xyz for cust 100, charged” not the card number.
  * Set a retention policy: e.g., keep audit logs for at least one year (PCI requirement for audit trails), possibly longer (several years) if storage allows, since they might be useful for historical analysis of when things changed.
* **Audit Log Access UI:** Provide an interface (likely for System Admins or Auditors) to view audit logs:

  * Possibly a filtered view where they can search by user, customer, or action type, and time range.
  * For example, if an issue is found (like an unexpected subscription cancellation), an admin can search the audit log for that subscription ID to see who canceled it and when.
  * Ensure this log view is read-only. Possibly allow export of audit logs for a period as CSV for compliance audits.
  * We might not expose all system logs (like low-level errors) to UI, just audit of user actions and high-level events. Devs can access system logs via server or monitoring tools.
* **Monitoring and Alerts:**

  * Set up alerts for suspicious events:

    * e.g., if there are too many failed login attempts in short time (potential brute force) – trigger an alert to security/admin team.
    * If an admin user logs in from an unusual location or at odd hours, maybe flag (this might be advanced, but at least logs exist to do this analysis).
    * If system errors spike or certain critical error occurs (like cannot reach payment gateway for X minutes) – send alert to devops.
  * These are operational but tie into logging (using log metrics for triggers).
* **Compliance and Reporting using Logs:**

  * Audit logs help demonstrate compliance with policies (e.g., show who accessed what data – fulfilling the accountability principle of GDPR, and certain PCI requirements about tracking admin access to cardholder data).
  * For SOC2, logs form evidence for many controls (like showing we monitor unauthorized access attempts).
  * The system should protect log integrity: restrict who (even among admins) can access or delete logs. Possibly store them in append-only storage or in a separate database schema only accessible by SysAdmin role.
  * If needed, implement log checksums or write to WORM (write once read many) storage for audit-critical logs to ensure they aren't tampered.
* **Database Auditing:** In addition to app-level logging, we may enable DB-level audit for certain tables (like a trigger that archives old value on update or a full history table). For instance, a `subscription_history` table capturing any change to subscription status or plan can act as an audit trail for subscription changes. This duplicates info we also log in audit log, but can be useful for queries (like show timeline of subscription).

  * Similarly, we keep `plan_history` (so one can see how pricing changed over time – which might be needed to answer "when did we raise price for Plan X").
  * Payment gateway interactions rely on gateway for full audit, but we log all calls and outcomes on our side too for completeness.
* **Example Audit Log Entries:**

  * “2025-08-01 00:05:00 UTC – System – GENERATED 512 invoices for monthly renewal cycle (batch process) – success: 510, failed: 2 (logged separately).”
  * “2025-08-01 00:05:05 UTC – System – PAYMENT ATTEMPT – Invoice #1234 charged via Stripe token \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*1111 – Result: Success (TransactionID ch\_abc123).”
  * “2025-08-01 00:05:06 UTC – System – PAYMENT ATTEMPT – Invoice #1235 charged via Stripe token \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*0505 – Result: Declined (Insufficient funds) – Marked for retry.”
  * “2025-08-01 00:10:00 UTC – EmailService – Sent payment failure email to Customer #200 (Invoice #1235).”
  * “2025-08-01 09:30:22 UTC – User #5 (SupportAgent) – UPDATED Customer #200 – changed email from [johndoe@old.com](mailto:johndoe@old.com) to [johndoe@new.com](mailto:johndoe@new.com).”
  * “2025-08-01 09:31:10 UTC – User #5 (SupportAgent) – RESENT Invoice #1235 to Customer #200 via email.”
  * “2025-08-02 14:00:00 UTC – User #2 (ProductManager) – CREATED Promotion code HOLIDAY2025 (15% off, valid Dec 2025).”
  * “2025-08-15 17:45:12 UTC – User #3 (SysAdmin) – DEACTIVATED Plan #8 (Basic Plan) – 50 subscribers affected (no new signups allowed).”
  * These entries show a mix of automated and manual actions, each with user or system context and detail.
* **Log Scalability:** Over years, logs can become huge. We might implement log archiving: e.g., move logs older than 1 year to an archive table or external storage to keep the main log table lighter. But always ensure availability for compliance period.

  * Use indexing on date and maybe user ID for search efficiency.
  * Partition log table by date (year/month) if extremely high volume events occur daily.
  * The audit log UI can query specific time slices or by user to avoid scanning entire thing.
* **Error Logs:** Keep internal error logs out of user-facing UIs but accessible to developers (through file or monitoring). If a critical error happens that affects users, show a friendly error message on UI and automatically log details for devs. Possibly send alerts on critical errors.

By implementing thorough auditing and logging, the platform achieves **accountability and traceability** for actions on the system. This not only aids in diagnosing issues and reversing mistakes (we can see what happened and by whom), but also forms a key part of the system’s security controls and compliance evidence. It provides an audit trail that can answer the “who, what, when” of any significant event in the subscription lifecycle, thereby increasing trust internally and with customers that changes are tracked and not made in hiding.

## Glossary

* **Subscription:** An arrangement where a customer pays on a recurring basis for ongoing access to a product or service. In this platform, a Subscription record links a Customer to a Plan and has a billing schedule (e.g., monthly or annual). It includes state (trial, active, canceled) and dates (start, next renewal, etc.).
* **Plan (Subscription Plan):** A predefined set of features and pricing for a subscription. Customers subscribe to a plan. Examples: Basic, Pro, Premium plans. Each Plan defines the service level and base recurring price. Plans can be active or retired (not offered to new customers).
* **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):** A metric representing the total monthly recurring subscription revenue. It is calculated by summing the normalized monthly fees of all active subscriptions. For annual subscriptions, 1/12 of the annual amount counts towards MRR. MRR is used to track revenue growth trends in a normalized way.
* **ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue):** A yearly version of recurring revenue, often simply MRR × 12 for a quick figure. It indicates the revenue run-rate on an annualized basis (e.g., \$100k MRR corresponds to \$1.2M ARR).
* **Churn (Customer Churn Rate):** The rate at which customers cancel their subscriptions. Usually expressed as a percentage of subscribers who cancel in a period out of the total at the start. For example, if starting with 100 and 5 cancel, churn rate is 5%. The platform tracks churn to assess retention health. *Revenue churn* refers to the amount of MRR lost due to cancellations/downgrades.
* **Upselling:** Convincing an existing customer to move to a higher-priced or higher-tier plan (or increase their quantity) to generate more revenue. For example, upgrading from Basic to Pro plan. Upselling increases a customer's spending and is a key factor in *Net Revenue Retention*.
* **Cross-Selling:** Selling an additional product or service to an existing customer (distinct from their current subscription). For example, a customer of Product A is cross-sold a subscription to Product B. Cross-sell strategies aim to increase the breadth of products a customer uses.
* **Dunning:** The process of handling failed payment collections and retries for overdue invoices. A *dunning management* system will attempt to collect payment again over a schedule (e.g., retry a declined card after 3 days, 7 days) and send reminders to the customer. If all attempts fail, the subscription may be suspended or canceled as per policy.
* **Proration:** The act of adjusting charges to account for a partial period when a subscription changes mid-cycle. The platform uses **proration** when a customer upgrades or downgrades in the middle of a billing period – they receive a credit for unused time on the old plan and are charged only for the remaining time on the new plan. This ensures fairness so the customer pays proportionally “in pro-rata” for services.
* **Trial (Free Trial):** A period during which a new subscriber can use the service for free (or at no charge) before the regular billing starts. Trials are usually offered to encourage sign-ups. For example, a 14-day trial – no charge until day 15 when billing begins. If the customer cancels before the trial ends, they are not charged. Trials may require a payment method upfront or not, depending on configuration.
* **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):** A set of security standards for organizations that handle credit card information. Our platform complies with PCI DSS by not storing card numbers and using tokenization via a certified gateway. We enforce encryption and access controls around payment data to maintain PCI compliance (e.g., card data encrypted in transit and not stored in full).
* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** European Union regulation on data protection and privacy. It grants individuals rights such as access to their data, correction, deletion (the "right to be forgotten"), and data portability. Our platform includes features to support GDPR compliance – for instance, deleting or anonymizing a customer's personal data upon request and allowing export of their data. We also obtain consent for processing and secure personal data to GDPR standards.
* **API (Application Programming Interface):** In this context, the set of endpoints through which external systems or client-side scripts can interact with the platform’s data and functions. For example, `GET /api/subscriptions/{id}` is an API call to retrieve a subscription’s details. The platform provides RESTful JSON APIs for integration and automation purposes.
* **Webhook:** A method for one system to send real-time notifications to another via HTTP callbacks. The platform uses webhooks from the payment gateway to receive payment event notifications (e.g., a charge succeeded or failed). We also might offer webhooks to clients to inform them of events (like a subscription being canceled) on our platform. Webhooks require a listening endpoint and often include a signature for security.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** A security model where system permissions are assigned to user roles rather than individuals directly. Users are given roles (like Admin, Support, Customer) and inherit the allowed actions for those roles. Our platform’s RBAC ensures, for instance, that a Support agent can view customer info but not modify plan prices, whereas a System Admin can perform all operations. This simplifies administration and improves security through least privilege.
