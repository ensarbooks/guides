# Product Requirements Document: Enterprise Product Management Tool

## Introduction

Enterprise Product Management Tool (EPMT) is a SaaS platform designed to streamline the **end-to-end product development lifecycle** for software products. It enables product teams to collect and manage ideas, plan and prioritize a development backlog, visualize product roadmaps, allocate team resources, integrate user feedback and bug tracking, and analyze product release outcomes in one unified system. The goal is to provide **enterprise-grade capabilities** that specifically support software product creation and improvement. This document serves as a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for EPMT, outlining its functional modules, user roles, user stories, acceptance criteria, workflows, system architecture, integration points, and non-functional requirements. The PRD is organized by major modules and addresses the needs of various user roles (product managers, developers, stakeholders, etc.), with an emphasis on features relevant to large software development teams in an enterprise environment.

**Key Capabilities Overview:** EPMT will provide the following core capabilities (aligned with industry definitions of product management software):

- **Idea Management:** A centralized idea hub for capturing, organizing, and evaluating ideas for product improvements and new features. This includes an idea submission portal, voting and discussion, and tools to promote the best ideas into the development pipeline.
- **Backlog Prioritization:** Functionality to create, prioritize, and maintain a development backlog of features, user stories, and bug fixes. The backlog will help teams organize tasks and plan iterations or sprints, ensuring the most valuable work is addressed first.
- **Product Roadmapping:** Visual roadmapping tools to plan and communicate product development progress over time. Roadmaps will link high-level initiatives to timeline schedules (e.g. releases or quarters), providing a clear view of how work aligns with strategic goals.
- **Resource Allocation:** Resource management capabilities to assign tasks to team members based on their skills, strengths, and availability. This helps optimize workload distribution and ensures each task has the appropriate owner.
- **User Feedback & Bug Tracking Integration:** Native support or integrations for gathering user feedback and tracking bugs. The tool will either provide built-in feedback forums/analytics and basic issue tracking or integrate with established tools (e.g. JIRA, Zendesk) to incorporate external inputs into product planning.
- **Product Release Analytics:** Analytics features to evaluate the performance and adoption of product releases. The system will track metrics (usage, engagement, user satisfaction, etc.) for each release to inform product decisions and demonstrate ROI on new features.
- **Enterprise-Grade Platform:** All functionality is purpose-built for software product development (not generic project management), with enterprise-grade scalability, security, and integration capabilities. This includes role-based access control, single sign-on (SSO), audit trails, and compliance with security standards expected by large organizations.

The subsequent sections detail each of these areas, including specific requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria. Additionally, overall system-wide requirements (non-functional requirements such as scalability, security, etc.) and architectural considerations are described to ensure the solution meets enterprise IT standards.

## Product Overview

EPMT is envisioned as a **central platform for product teams** to go from initial concept to successful release. It addresses common challenges faced by enterprise software organizations, such as fragmented idea collection, difficulty in aligning development with strategy, lack of visibility into progress, and inefficiencies in coordinating team efforts. By unifying idea management, planning, execution, and analysis, EPMT will enable data-driven product decisions and foster collaboration across roles.

**Target Users and Use Cases:** The primary users are Product Managers who need to gather input, plan roadmaps, and drive execution. However, EPMT also supports the workflows of Engineering Managers (for resource allocation and backlog grooming), Developers (to understand priorities and update status), Designers and QA (to see upcoming features and log issues), Customer Success/Support teams (to contribute customer feedback and view roadmap updates), and Executive Stakeholders (to review product plans and outcomes). External users such as customers or partners may indirectly interact with the tool via an ideas portal or public roadmap if those features are exposed externally.

**Product Vision:** The vision for EPMT is to become the **single source of truth for product development** in an enterprise. All product ideas, decisions, plans, and results live in one place, ensuring traceability (you can trace a released feature back to the originating ideas and customer feedback) and alignment (roadmaps reflect strategic goals, and backlogs reflect roadmap priorities). The tool should help product teams build products that better satisfy customer needs and achieve business objectives by systematically leveraging feedback and data. EPMT is intentionally focused on software products and agile methodologies, supporting rapid iterations and continuous improvement.

**Scope and Limitations:** This PRD covers the requirements for the first major release of EPMT (Major version 1.0). In scope are all modules described (Idea Management, Backlog, Roadmap, Resource Management, Feedback/Bug integration, Release Analytics, User management, etc.) as well as the necessary infrastructure to support them. The tool will support **multiple product teams or projects within an organization**, i.e., it’s multi-project and multi-team by design (a single enterprise may manage several product backlogs and roadmaps). Out of scope for this initial version are highly specialized project management features not directly tied to product planning (e.g., financial budgeting, procurement) and non-software product support (the needs of hardware or physical product development, while similar, are not explicitly addressed). The tool is not intended to replace low-level developer tools like code repositories or CI/CD pipelines; rather, it integrates with them where needed (for example, linking to a commit or deployment status might be a future enhancement, but detailed CI pipeline management is not part of this product’s scope).

## Goals and Objectives

The key objectives of EPMT can be summarized as follows:

- **Centralize and Streamline Idea-to-Release Workflow:** Provide a structured process that takes inputs from ideas and feedback all the way through to development and release, ensuring nothing valuable falls through the cracks. By centralizing feedback and ideas, product managers can turn them into meaningful solutions more efficiently.
- **Improve Decision-Making with Data:** Use scoring, voting, and analytics to prioritize work based on customer value, strategic alignment, and effort. For instance, implementing scorecards to quantify business value and effort helps rank ideas and features objectively. Also, provide release analytics to close the feedback loop with quantitative data on feature adoption.
- **Enhance Cross-Team Transparency:** Ensure that all stakeholders (engineering, sales, support, leadership, etc.) have appropriate visibility into product plans and progress. Roadmaps and status updates should be easily accessible to those who need them (with proper permissions). Automated notifications and communication of changes (e.g., idea status, feature progress) will keep everyone informed.
- **Optimize Resource Utilization:** Facilitate effective assignment of tasks to people, balancing workloads and leveraging each team member’s strengths. By matching tasks with employee skills and availability, the tool aims to increase productivity and prevent burnout. Capacity planning features will help set realistic expectations about what the team can deliver in a given timeframe.
- **Integrate with the Ecosystem:** Fit into enterprise IT ecosystems by integrating with popular tools (for issue tracking, customer feedback, authentication, etc.), rather than forcing users to abandon their existing workflows. For example, integrating with CRM or support systems can link ideas to customer accounts, and integrating with Jira or other dev tools ensures development progress is reflected in the product plan.
- **Maintain Enterprise-Grade Quality:** Meet enterprise requirements for security, scalability, and reliability. The system should handle large volumes of data (ideas, tickets, users) and many concurrent users, with robust performance. It should also adhere to security best practices (RBAC, encryption, audit logging, compliance standards like SOC 2 and GDPR) to satisfy enterprise IT audits. Non-functional goals like 99.9% uptime, cross-browser support, and a responsive UI for various devices also fall here.

These goals inform the requirements in each module section below. Each feature or requirement can be traced back to one or more of these objectives, ensuring the product delivers tangible value to enterprise product teams.

## User Roles and Permission Model

EPMT will employ a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** model to manage permissions. Different user roles correspond to typical functions in a product development organization. Each role has specific access rights to modules and actions. The system should allow an administrator to assign roles to each user (and a user can have multiple roles if needed, though typically one primary role per context). Permissions may also be refined at the level of individual products or projects (e.g., a user could be a Product Manager for Product A’s workspace but have read-only access to Product B).

**User Roles and Descriptions:**

| **Role**                             | **Description and Responsibilities**                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Permissions**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Administrator**                    | Superuser for the platform. Often an IT admin or tool administrator. Manages user accounts, role assignments, global settings, and integrations.                                                                                                        | Full access to all modules and settings across the organization. Can configure system-wide settings (SSO, integrations, data retention policies, etc.) and manage all products’ data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Product Manager**                  | Primary user driving product planning. Manages ideas, backlog, roadmaps, and oversees releases for one or multiple products. Product Managers ensure the product vision and roadmap are executed.                                                       | Create/read/update/delete (CRUD) access in Idea Management (can moderate and accept ideas), Backlog (can create/edit stories, prioritize, assign), Roadmaps (can create/edit roadmap items), Releases (define releases and view analytics). Can comment on anything and view feedback/bug reports. Typically cannot change global settings but can configure their product’s settings (like categories, score criteria). |
| **Product Owner/Lead** (optional)    | Similar to Product Manager; some organizations use this for a more tactical role focused on backlog grooming and sprint planning. In EPMT, this role can be equivalent to Product Manager or slightly limited version focused on backlog and execution. | Similar permissions to Product Manager, possibly without certain strategic roadmap editing rights (configurable per company’s usage). (This role is optional and could be combined with Product Manager role depending on the organization.)                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Engineering Manager**              | Oversees development team’s execution. Uses the tool to view backlog, monitor progress, and allocate team members to tasks. Focus on resource management and ensuring timely delivery.                                                                  | Can view and edit Backlog items (especially to assign team members and update statuses), view Roadmaps, manage Resource Allocation (assign/reassign tasks, set team members’ availability). Can comment on ideas and mark technical input (e.g., feasibility or estimates). May have edit rights on bug items. No access to admin settings.                                                                              |
| **Developer**                        | Team member implementing features and fixing bugs. Interacts with the tool mainly to view assigned tasks, update statuses, log work, and possibly provide feedback on incoming work.                                                                    | Can read the Backlog (at least items in their project/team), update status and details on items assigned to them (e.g., mark a story as completed, add a comment or attachment). Can view the Roadmap for context (read-only). Limited or no access to the Idea portal management (but may submit ideas or comments as any user). Can view feedback and bugs relevant to their work.                                     |
| **QA/Test Engineer**                 | Ensures quality by testing features and logging bugs. Uses backlog and bug tracking aspects of EPMT.                                                                                                                                                    | Can create and edit bug reports (if using the native bug tracking) or see integrated bug items. Can view backlog and verify when issues are resolved. Can comment on items (e.g., adding reproduction steps to bug). Typically read access to Roadmaps. Might submit ideas or improvements based on testing results.                                                                                                     |
| **Designer/UX**                      | Contributes design ideas and needs to stay informed of upcoming features. May also propose ideas.                                                                                                                                                       | Can submit ideas and comments in Idea Management, see backlog items to prepare designs, and view Roadmaps for planning. Likely read-only on backlog prioritization and no direct editing of roadmaps. Could be given permission to prioritize certain design-related backlog items if needed (configurable).                                                                                                             |
| **Customer Support** (Support Agent) | Interfaces with users and logs their feedback or bug reports. Bridges external feedback with product team.                                                                                                                                              | Can create ideas on behalf of customers (proxy voting or idea submission), view idea status to inform customers, and escalate important bug reports. May have a specialized interface to link support tickets to product ideas/features. Read access to Roadmaps (to communicate timelines to users with caution). Cannot modify backlog or roadmaps.                                                                    |
| **Stakeholder/Executive**            | Higher-level stakeholders (executives, sales leaders, etc.) who need visibility into product direction and progress, but not involved in day-to-day management.                                                                                         | Read-only access to selected information: can view Roadmaps (executive or external view), see summary reports and release analytics. Can submit ideas or vote (especially sales might contribute ideas from clients). No editing rights in backlog or resource allocation. Possibly an **External Stakeholder** variant for clients or partners with access only to a sanitized external roadmap or idea portal.         |
| **External Contributor**             | (If enabled) External users such as customers, beta testers, or partners who can submit ideas or feedback through a portal.                                                                                                                             | Very limited access – typically only to the Idea Submission Portal (can create ideas, comment, and vote) and possibly view a curated list of their own submissions or a public roadmap. They cannot see internal priorities or other confidential information. This is managed via a separate portal interface for security.                                                                                             |

_Note:_ The roles above can be configured by the Administrator. For example, some organizations might have a single **“Product Owner”** role fulfilling both strategic and tactical parts of product management. The permission model should be flexible to accommodate custom roles or adjust permissions per role if needed (enterprise admins appreciate the ability to fine-tune access). At minimum, the roles and privileges will match the table above by default.

**Permissions & Access Rules:**

- **Module Access:** Each module (Ideas, Backlog, Roadmap, etc.) will have permissions for view vs modify for each role. For instance, only Product Managers (and perhaps Engineering Managers) can re-prioritize the backlog or publish changes to the roadmap. Developers can update task status but not reorder the whole backlog. The system will enforce these rules on the UI and API level.
- **Object Ownership:** Certain objects might have an owner field (e.g., a backlog item’s owner is the assigned developer, an idea’s owner might be the PM handling it). Ownership might confer special permissions (e.g., the assignee can change status, or the idea creator can edit their idea’s description unless/until it’s moderated). These details will be specified in acceptance criteria per module.
- **Cross-Project Access:** If the tool is used for multiple products or projects, users might have roles scoped to each project. For example, a user could be a Product Manager on Project X (full access to X’s data) but only a Stakeholder on Project Y (read-only for Y’s data). The system should support scoping permissions to specific product workspaces.
- **Admin Overrides:** Admin users can access all data regardless of project scope (to help in reassigning or troubleshooting as needed). Admin actions (like accessing a restricted project) should be logged for audit.
- **Audit Logs:** Every significant action (e.g., changing a backlog item status, deleting an idea, modifying a user’s role) should be recorded in an audit log, including who performed it and when, to meet enterprise compliance and security audit needs. This is part of the Security requirements (detailed later) but is mentioned here as it closely ties to permission governance.

The above roles and permissions ensure that users have the appropriate level of access to do their jobs without exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized changes. **Permission checks** will be enforced on every relevant action. For example, if a Developer (who is not a Product Manager) attempts to change the priority of a backlog item via the API or UI, the system will reject it. Likewise, external contributors cannot see internal comments or backlog details that aren’t explicitly made public. This robust permission model aligns with enterprise expectations around **role-based access control** and **least privilege principle**.

## Idea Management Module

**Description:** The Idea Management module provides a systematic way to **collect, organize, and evaluate ideas** from various sources (customers, internal team, stakeholders). It serves as an “innovation inbox” where suggestions for product improvements or new features can be captured and curated. This module will include a **Customer/Contributor Ideas Portal** for external input and an **Internal Idea Board** for team brainstorming and triage. Product Managers use this module to review incoming ideas, discuss them, score them, and decide which ideas should be promoted into the development backlog.

&#x20;_Example of a customer-facing ideas portal where users can submit and vote on ideas._ In this example, ideas are listed with titles, descriptions, vote counts, and statuses (e.g., “Planning to implement”, “Future consideration”). The Idea Management module in EPMT will provide a similar portal, branded for the product, allowing users (customers or team members) to add new ideas, upvote or comment on existing ideas, and see updates on their suggestions. By centralizing feedback in one place, it becomes easier to spot common themes and high-demand requests. The system organizes ideas by categories (for example, by product area or feature set) and tracks metadata like submitter, date, number of votes, and status.

**Key Features & Requirements:**

- **Idea Submission:** Users (depending on role, e.g., customers via a portal or any logged-in team member) can submit a new idea. An idea consists of a title, detailed description, optional attachments (e.g., screenshots), and metadata like category (the user can select a category such as “UI Improvement” or “New Integration”). The submission form should be simple and accessible via web; consider allowing email-in or other channels in the future (not for v1). When submitted, the idea is recorded with status “New” and visible in the idea list for review.
- **Idea Portal (External and Internal):** Provide a web portal interface for idea submission and browsing. The portal can be internal (employees only) and/or external (for customers). External portal would be read/write for external contributors but only show a subset of information (no sensitive internal comments, for example). The portal should be **custom-brandable** with the company or product logo and colors, since enterprises often want the portal to look like an extension of their product. External users may need to register or it could allow anonymous or email-verified submissions (configurable). Internal users (with accounts) can use the integrated UI.
- **Voting and Ranking:** Authenticated users can upvote (or possibly upvote/downvote, but typically upvote only to keep it positive) ideas to indicate support. A vote count is displayed on each idea. (Optionally, allow internal product team to add “proxy votes” on behalf of customers who gave feedback through other channels, meaning a PM can increment the vote count to reflect that, say, 5 customers asked for this in support calls). Ideas can be sorted by vote popularity, recentness, etc., to help identify trends.
- **Discussion/Comments:** Each idea has a discussion thread. Users (depending on permission) can comment on ideas to ask for clarifications or provide additional input. Product team members can use comments to ask the submitter questions or to give status updates manually. The system might also generate automated status change notifications in the thread (e.g., “Status changed to In Review”).
- **Tagging & Categorization:** The system allows grouping ideas by theme, category, or tag. For example, tags could denote the component or feature area (e.g., “Mobile App”, “Performance”, “Reporting”), or the type of request (“New Feature”, “Enhancement”, “Bug fix suggestion”). This helps in filtering and analyzing ideas. A **category filter** in the portal can let users browse ideas relevant to certain areas.
- **Idea Status Workflow:** Define a set of statuses an idea can move through: e.g., “New” -> “Under Review” -> “Planned” -> “In Progress” -> “Completed” -> “Rejected” (and perhaps “Duplicate” if an idea is redundant with another). Product Managers can update the status as decisions are made or as development progresses. When an idea’s status changes, the system should optionally notify the original submitter and voters (e.g., via email or in-app notification). This **communication of progress** keeps contributors engaged and appreciated.
- **Scoring & Evaluation:** Provide a mechanism for product managers to **score and prioritize ideas** based on defined criteria. For example, a scorecard could capture “Impact” vs “Effort” or use a framework like RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort). The tool could allow creating custom score fields (e.g., a 1-5 score for customer value and a 1-5 for implementation effort) and then calculate a composite score. This quantification helps objectively compare ideas. The UI can show a score or even plot ideas on a chart (value vs effort) if needed in future. In v1, at least allow sorting by a computed priority score.
- **Promote to Backlog:** Crucially, the idea module integrates with the backlog module. A Product Manager can take an idea and convert it into a **backlog item** (e.g., a user story or feature in the development backlog) once it’s decided to move forward. During this conversion (promotion), the system should allow creating a new backlog entry pre-filled with the idea’s details, and link the idea to that backlog item. This maintains traceability. Possibly, the idea status could automatically change to “Planned” or “In Development” when promoted.
- **Reporting on Ideas:** Provide analytics or reporting such as **trending ideas** (which ideas are getting the most votes recently), number of new ideas over time, or distribution by category. This helps product teams spot patterns (e.g., many ideas relate to a certain module of the product, indicating high demand for improvements there). A dashboard for idea metrics (like top 10 ideas by votes, ideas by status, etc.) is desirable.
- **Search and Filtering:** As the number of ideas grows, it’s important to have search functionality (full-text search on idea titles/descriptions) and filters (by status, category, submitter, vote count, date) to quickly find relevant ideas. Enterprise users need robust filtering since they might accumulate thousands of ideas.
- **Moderation & Spam Control:** For external idea portals, include basic moderation tools. Admins/Product Managers should be able to edit or remove inappropriate submissions. Perhaps implement a spam filter or captcha for external submissions to prevent bots from spamming the idea portal. (Non-functional requirement: ensure performance even if many external hits.)
- **Privacy and Visibility:** Possibly allow marking certain ideas or comments as private/internal. For example, if internal users discuss an idea’s technical details or feasibility, those comments might be internal-only, while the external submitter just sees the high-level status. This might be advanced, but at least have clarity on what external vs internal users see. For v1, a simpler approach: external users only see the portal and not the internal comment threads if they are separate.
- **Multiple Idea Sources:** Beyond the portal, allow internal capture of ideas from various sources. E.g., a Product Manager can input an idea that came from a meeting, or a sales team can import a list of client requests. Perhaps integrations (future) with tools like Salesforce or support ticket systems to ingest ideas. While not implemented in v1, the design should keep it open (maybe through an API endpoint to create idea entries, or CSV import).
- **Internationalization Support:** If the tool will be used globally, ensure the idea portal supports multiple languages or at least UTF-8 characters and perhaps an ability to set a language for the interface for external users. (This might be lower priority, but consider enterprise global teams).

**User Stories (Idea Management):**

- _As a customer or end user, I want to submit a new idea for a product improvement via a simple portal, so that I can contribute feedback and request features I need._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ Given a publicly accessible ideas portal, when an unauthenticated or external user navigates to it, they can register/login (if required) and fill out a form with at least a title and description for their idea. Upon submission, the idea is saved with the user’s identity (or anonymously) and a confirmation is shown. The idea appears in the “New Ideas” list with status “New” and is visible to other users for voting. Users should be prevented from submitting extremely incomplete forms (e.g., title or description missing – validate required fields). An email confirmation is sent to the submitter acknowledging receipt.

- _As a Product Manager, I want to review new ideas and categorize or tag them, so that I can organize the idea backlog and identify related suggestions._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ When logged in as Product Manager, I can view a list of ideas filtered by status = New. For each idea, I have controls to edit it: I can assign it to a category (choose from predefined categories) or add tags, and change its status to “Under Review” (or another appropriate status). The system should allow bulk actions (e.g., selecting multiple similar ideas and tagging them all “UI”) to speed up triage. Once an idea is tagged or recategorized, it is findable under that category in filters. The action is recorded (e.g., change history keeps note of who and when it was categorized).

- _As a Product Manager, I want to gauge the popularity of an idea by seeing how many votes it has and any related ideas or feedback, so that I can prioritize ideas that have broad support._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ On viewing an idea’s detail page, I can see the total number of votes it has and a list or count of voters (or at least the count, possibly with identities if internal). There is also a view of related ideas (e.g., duplicates or similar suggestions might be linked by the PM). The system could suggest potential duplicates by comparing titles (optional). For prioritization, the idea detail should display its score (if the PM has entered values into a scorecard). For example, an idea might show “Score: 8/10 (High Value, Low Effort)” if the PM rated those dimensions.

- _As a Product Manager, I want to convert a promising idea into a work item for my development backlog with minimal effort, so that moving from ideation to implementation is seamless._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ On an idea’s detail or in the idea list, for users with permission, there is an option “Promote to Backlog” (or “Create Feature from Idea”). Clicking it opens a dialog or uses a template to create a new backlog item (in the Backlog module) with the idea’s title as the story title and the idea description as the initial description. The new backlog item should automatically reference the source idea (e.g., “Originated from Idea #123”) and that link is stored. After promotion, the idea’s status should automatically update to a configurable status like “Planned” or “In Backlog”, and the idea is locked from further voting (optionally) to indicate it’s being acted on. The system should prevent duplicate promotions (if already promoted, perhaps the button is disabled or suggests linking to the existing backlog item).

- _As a user who submitted an idea or voted for it, I want to receive notifications when there’s an update on that idea, so that I stay informed about the status of my input._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ When an idea I’m involved with changes status or receives an official comment from the product team, the system should send me a notification. This could be an email stating, for example, “Your idea ‘Enhanced GPS accuracy’ has been marked as Planned” or “A product manager commented on your idea…”. If the platform has in-app notifications, those should be populated as well. There should be an option for users to opt out of notification emails if they don’t want them (especially external users).

- _As a Product Manager, I want to analyze all collected ideas to identify common themes and high-impact suggestions, so that I can align the product roadmap with what customers and stakeholders want most._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ The system provides an Idea analytics view where I can see, for example, a chart of top categories by number of ideas, or a list of ideas sorted by vote count or score. I should be able to filter this report by date range (e.g., ideas submitted in last quarter) or by origin (internal vs external). One key output: a list of “Top N Ideas” by popularity. Another might be “Ideas by Status” (how many are implemented vs pending vs rejected). The acceptance criteria for this is satisfied if a Product Manager can generate or view these summaries without needing to manually export data. For MVP, even a downloadable CSV of ideas with their attributes would allow external analysis, but ideally some in-tool visualization exists.

**Workflow – Idea Intake and Triage:** To illustrate how the Idea Management flows, consider this typical scenario:

1. **Submission:** A user (could be a customer via the external portal or an employee via the tool’s UI) submits an idea for a new feature. The idea is saved with status “New” and appears on the idea board.
2. **Notification of New Idea:** The Product Manager (or a designated “Ideas moderator”) receives a notification of the new idea (could be an email summary or in-app alert). They log into EPMT and go to the “New Ideas” section.
3. **Review & Discussion:** The Product Manager reads the idea. If more information is needed, they comment asking the submitter for details. The submitter (and perhaps other interested parties) get notified and can reply. A discussion ensues on the idea thread.
4. **Categorize & Merge:** The PM realizes this idea is similar to another one submitted earlier. They link the two (mark one as duplicate of the other or combine them). Alternatively, if distinct, they tag it under an appropriate theme (say “Analytics features”).
5. **Voting Accumulates:** Over the next week, several other users see the idea and upvote it. It rises to become one of the top-voted ideas in its category.
6. **Scoring & Decision:** During a product team meeting, the PM uses the tool’s scorecard to rate all top ideas. This particular idea scores highly on customer value. The PM changes its status to “Planned” or some intermediate “Reviewed” state.
7. **Promotion to Backlog:** The PM decides to include this idea in the next release cycle. They click “Promote to Backlog”. A new backlog item (user story) is created, linked to this idea. The PM adds acceptance criteria and other details to the backlog item. The idea status auto-updates to “Planned” or “In Backlog”.
8. **Communication to Voters:** All users who voted or subscribed to the idea get an update that the idea is now planned for development (and maybe which release it’s targeted for, if the PM adds that to the status comment).
9. **Closure:** Once the development is done and the feature released, the PM might mark the idea as “Completed” and perhaps write a final comment “This idea has been implemented in version 2.3 – thank you for your feedback!”. The idea is then archived from the active list (though still searchable for reference). The voters might get one more notification that their idea is now implemented, completing the feedback loop.

Through this workflow, EPMT ensures that ideas are not lost and contributors feel heard, as they can see exactly what happens to their suggestions. This fosters a transparent and collaborative product development culture.

**Integration Considerations (Idea Management):** For future extensibility, note that idea submissions could also come via integrations (like an API for other systems to push ideas). While full integration is covered in a later section, the idea module should expose an API endpoint to create ideas (with proper authentication, so that perhaps a company’s mobile app could allow users to submit an idea that goes straight into EPMT). Similarly, if an organization uses an existing idea/voting tool or an Excel spreadsheet of requests, a one-time import capability would accelerate adoption of EPMT. In v1, focus is on the direct UI/portal usage, but keep these extensions in mind.

## Backlog & Prioritization Module

**Description:** The Backlog module is the heart of planning and **task organization**. It contains the list of all **planned work items** for the product – typically user stories, feature tasks, enhancements, technical debt items, and bug fixes that are to be addressed by the development team. This module enables product managers and engineering teams to **prioritize tasks** and maintain an ordered queue of work, often known as the product backlog in agile methodologies. It improves task organization by providing structure (epics, stories, sub-tasks) and by making prioritization decisions visible and trackable. The backlog serves as the bridge between high-level ideas/roadmap and day-to-day execution, ensuring that the most important tasks are worked on first.

**Key Features & Requirements:**

- **Backlog Item Types:** Support different types of backlog entries: e.g., _Feature_, _User Story_, _Bug_, _Chore/Task_, _Epic_. This allows classification of work. Each item will have fields like Title, Description, Type, Priority, Status, Story Points/Estimate (for features/stories), Assignee, etc. There should be a way to group stories under Epics (hierarchical backlog: epics contain user stories). If needed, allow sub-tasks under a story (though that might be more execution level, could integrate with dev tool if needed).
- **Prioritization Ordering:** Users with the appropriate role (Product Manager or similar) can **order the backlog** by priority. This could be done via drag-and-drop reordering of items in a list, or by editing a priority value (like a rank or MoSCoW category). The UI should make it easy to reorder items, even many at once (maybe via a rank number or just by moving them). This order represents the team’s priority – item at position 1 is top priority. Everyone should be able to view the backlog sorted by this rank by default.
- **Custom Priority Frameworks:** In addition to manual ordering, provide optional tools to **prioritize based on criteria**. For instance, support common prioritization frameworks such as MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won’t) categories, RICE score, value vs effort quadrant, etc. The user should be able to tag each item with such categories or scores, and possibly use filters or views to sort by those. For example, a PM might assign MoSCoW values to all items and then filter to see all “Must have” items for MVP. Or use RICE: each backlog item can have fields for Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort, and the system calculates the RICE score. While full automation of prioritization is not required, these frameworks guide the PM. **Acceptance criteria** for this: the system should allow capturing these values and at least sorting or filtering by them, even if the final ordering is still manual. According to one product management tool example, built-in support for RICE, value/effort, MoSCoW etc., with custom formula capabilities, greatly aids prioritization. EPMT should similarly allow such flexibility.
- **Batch Operations & Bulk Prioritization:** The backlog likely will be large (hundreds of items). Provide tools to multi-select items and apply actions: e.g., assign multiple items to a release, change their status or priority in batch, etc. This is important for efficiency during backlog grooming sessions.
- **Status Workflow for Backlog Items:** Each item goes through statuses (like an agile workflow). For instance: _Open/New_ -> _Refined_ (ready for development) -> _In Progress_ -> _Done_ (or _Closed_). For bug type, maybe include _Verified_ etc., but in general, allow a configurable workflow or at least a standard one. Status changes can be done manually in the tool or via integration with dev tools (if a dev marks a Jira ticket complete, EPMT could reflect that). At minimum, provide a kanban-like board view as an alternative to list view, where columns are statuses and items can be moved to update status. This helps teams during stand-ups or planning meetings to visualize progress.
- **Link to Roadmap and Releases:** Backlog items should have fields to indicate if they are scheduled for a particular release or timeframe. For example, an item might have “Target Release: Q4 2025” or “Sprint 5” or similar. This connects backlog items to the roadmap schedule. In EPMT, we might manage releases in a separate structure (see Release Analytics module), but backlog items should be assignable to a release entity. Also, backlog items that originate from ideas should retain a link back to the idea (and possibly show that link in the item details for context).
- **Dependencies:** The system should allow noting dependencies between backlog items (e.g., Feature B depends on A). This could simply be a reference link (one item can mark another as prerequisite) or more advanced like not letting an item start until the dependency is done (for planning). Visualization of dependencies (like a graph or alerts if scheduling conflicts) might be more advanced, but at least record them.
- **Backlog Views (Filtering/Grouping):** Users need to slice the backlog in various ways. Common needs: filter by item type (show only Bugs, or only Epics), by status (what’s in progress), by assignee (tasks assigned to Alice), by tag/category (e.g., all security-related items), or by release (items planned for next release). Grouping could be by epic (see all stories under each epic) or by status. Having multiple **views** (saved filters) will be useful: e.g., a “Current Sprint Backlog” view vs “Icebox (Future ideas)” view. Possibly include a **swimlane or section grouping** for “Next Up”, “Later” etc., though this can also be done via status or tags (some tools use a dedicated field for backlog stage).
- **Epic and Theme Management:** At the higher level, allow creation of Epics or initiatives (bigger bodies of work that span multiple backlog items). These epics can be reflected on the Roadmap. For backlog management, one should be able to assign stories to epics, and track epic progress (e.g., 5/10 stories done). A hierarchical display (expand/collapse epic to see its child stories) is nice-to-have for clarity.
- **Integration with Development Tools:** Recognizing that engineering teams often execute in tools like Jira, Azure Boards, etc., EPMT’s backlog could integrate with those. Integration specifics in a later section, but requirement wise: if integrated, changes in either system should sync. For example, if a PM creates a story in EPMT backlog and marks it for sprint 1, an equivalent issue is created in Jira for developers. Conversely, if a developer closes the Jira issue, EPMT marks the backlog item done. This ensures EPMT backlog is always up-to-date without double entry. For v1, even one integration (like Jira) would be valuable for enterprise adoption. If no integration, EPMT can itself serve as a lightweight issue tracker for devs (they can update status directly in EPMT).
- **Collaboration Features:** On each backlog item, users (PM, devs, QA) should be able to discuss specifics (comments thread or @mention others, etc.). Also, allow attaching files (designs, specs) or linking to documents (perhaps linking to Confluence or SharePoint pages with specs). The backlog item can have a rich description field for requirements and acceptance criteria (which the PM can fill out). Possibly integrate with the Idea details (if promoted from idea, it may already have some description).
- **Notifications & Changes:** When backlog items are updated (e.g., priority changed, description changed, or an item is assigned to a developer), relevant users should be notified. For example, if a dev is assigned a new story, they get a notification. If a high-priority item’s schedule changes, PM might want an alert. Also, maintain a history of changes on each item (who changed status when, etc.) for accountability.
- **Backlog Capacity Indicator:** Though more on resource management side, it’s useful if the backlog can show indications of how much work is in a planned iteration vs capacity. For instance, if an item is tagged in Sprint X, and we have a known velocity or capacity for Sprint X, show a burn-down or capacity fill bar. This might involve integration with the Resource module (to sum story points assigned in that sprint vs capacity). If not fully automated in v1, at least allow manual entry of Sprint capacity and calculation. (This crosses into planning, which might be partly addressed by Roadmap or Resource sections, but it’s mentioned here as backlog usage).

**User Stories (Backlog & Prioritization):**

- _As a Product Manager, I want to organize backlog items into a clear priority order, so that the development team knows what to work on next._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ In the backlog view, I can drag and drop items to rearrange their order. After reordering, all users see the updated order. For example, if “Feature X” was below “Feature Y” and I drag it above, its rank is updated and an indicator (like a sequence number or top-to-bottom listing) confirms the new order. The top of the backlog is considered highest priority. The system should preserve this order persistently and not automatically re-sort unless I do it or apply a sort filter. The backlog should allow at least 500+ items without performance issues, and reordering should be smooth (e.g., via an AJAX call rather than full page reload).

- _As a Product Manager, I want to assign each backlog item a priority using a consistent method (e.g., MoSCoW or score), so that I can justify and communicate why an item is ordered a certain way._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ For any backlog item, I can set its “Priority” field to one of: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won’t Have (in case of MoSCoW), or alternately set numeric scores. The UI provides a dropdown for priority category (if MoSCoW is enabled) or input fields for scoring criteria (if using a scoring model). Once set, I can filter the backlog to see all “Must Have” items. If I choose to, I can also sort by this priority field. The system might by default sort Must->Should->Could->Won’t in that case. If multiple frameworks are supported, I might choose one globally or per project. This story is satisfied if, for example, I can mark 10 items as “Must” and then filter to just those, and if I can see an item’s total score if using a numeric model. (The Fibery reference suggests built-in support for RICE, etc., so EPMT should allow at least one custom scoring formula too.)

- _As an Engineering Manager, I want to break down a large feature (epic) into smaller backlog items, so that the team can work on them in parallel and we can track progress at a granular level._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ I can create an Epic item (with a special type or flag). Then I can create multiple child items under that epic (or convert existing items to be under it). The UI could allow adding a new story and specifying “Epic = XYZ” to link it. In the backlog list, I should see a hierarchy: the Epic as a header and its stories indented or nested below. I can collapse/expand the epic to hide or show the stories for better overview. The epic itself might have no story points but shows a summary like “5/8 tasks completed”. Marking all child stories as done should allow me to close the epic easily. This hierarchical relationship should not break the overall ordering (epic can be positioned relative to other epics in the backlog).

- _As a Developer, I want to see the tasks assigned to me along with their priority and details, so that I understand what I should work on and the context of each task._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ When I log in and view the backlog (likely filtered by me or by current sprint), I can filter “Assignee = Me” and see all items I own. Each item shows at least the title, status, and if it’s in an epic or release. I can open an item to see its full description and acceptance criteria. I cannot change its priority order (since I’m not PM), but I can change status (e.g., start progress). The backlog view or a separate “My Work” view is acceptable. Also, if something is top priority overall, that likely will also reflect in my list if I’m assigned to it.

- _As a Product Manager, I want to easily identify which backlog items to include in the next release or sprint, so that I can allocate work appropriately._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ The backlog interface provides a way to mark a subset of items for “Next Release” or a specific sprint. For example, I can select items and set “Release = 1.0” or move items into a “Sprint Backlog” section if we maintain separate planned vs unplanned backlog. If the tool uses the concept of an active sprint, maybe a separate list (like how Scrum boards do). However, specifically: I should be able to filter by “Release = Unassigned” to see items not scheduled, then choose some and bulk update to “Release = October 2025 Release”. Once done, I filter “Release = October 2025” to confirm those items are now scheduled. The Roadmap view should now reflect that those items are part of that release (tie-in with roadmap module). Acceptable if the UI either has a drag mechanism (drag items into a release bucket) or an edit field to assign them.

- _As a QA engineer, I want to log a bug and ensure it appears in the backlog with appropriate priority, so that the team can prioritize fixing it among other work._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ I can create a backlog item of type “Bug”. When creating, I fill in severity/impact. The new bug appears in the backlog (perhaps in a separate “Bug backlog” queue or integrated with feature backlog, depending on filter). The PM or EM can then prioritize it like any other item. If severity is high, they may mark it as Must Have or move it near top. The bug’s presence in backlog ensures it’s visible in planning. If integrated with an external bug tracker, the creation might actually sync from there – but if directly created, it should still have all needed fields (steps, environment, etc., maybe via a bug template).

- _As a Product Manager, I want to generate a report or view of the backlog that shows how tasks map to strategic objectives or product areas, so that I can ensure alignment with our product strategy._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ The backlog items can be tagged or associated with high-level objectives (or components). Suppose we have strategic themes like “Improve User Engagement” or product areas like “Mobile App”. If I tag backlog items with those, I can then filter or group by them. E.g., a view “Group by Product Area” would list items under each area. Or a pivot by objective to see how many items (or story points) contribute to each goal. The acceptance is met if I can, for example, quickly list all backlog items under the “Performance Improvements” category and verify that we have enough in the pipeline to meet that objective. Alternatively, integration with the Roadmap’s goals: if Roadmap has initiatives, backlog items could link to an initiative. Then the report might show initiative -> list of linked backlog items. In short, traceability from strategy to tasks should be facilitated.

**Workflow – Backlog Grooming and Sprint Planning:**

1. **Intake:** Backlog items enter from multiple sources – ideas promoted, bugs reported, or directly created by team for technical tasks. Initially they might all sit in an unscheduled “backlog pool”.
2. **Backlog Grooming:** Product Manager and team periodically review the backlog (often in a meeting). They discuss new items, clarify them (updating descriptions, adding acceptance criteria or attachments as needed). They may also estimate them (developers give story points or time estimates). The PM then adjusts priority: e.g., item A is very important, so it goes near the top; item B can wait, so maybe mark as “Later” or just leave it lower. If any item is no longer relevant, it could be closed or moved to an “Icebox” (some do a separate list for dropped items).
3. **Prioritization Techniques:** The team might use the tool’s scoring. For instance, they fill RICE fields for a group of ideas, and see that Feature X has highest score. They then drag Feature X above others in ordering. The PM also marks some low-value items as “Won’t Have” for now.
4. **Preparation for Sprint/Release:** As a release or sprint planning session approaches, the PM filters the backlog to find high priority items that fit the upcoming scope. Suppose the next release can accommodate 10 story points and the top items amount to 15; the PM may pick a subset – top 3 features and 2 bugs – that sum to \~10 points. They then assign those items to “Release 1.0” (or Sprint 1) in the tool. Perhaps they move them to a separate sprint backlog view for execution.
5. **Resource Check:** The Engineering Manager uses the resource view (next module) to ensure no developer is overloaded with the planned tasks. If one is, they might swap an item or reassign one.
6. **Execution:** During the sprint, developers work on items. They update status in EPMT or in the integrated tool. The PM monitors progress via the backlog’s status filter or a board view (e.g., sees items moving to “In Progress” and “Done”). If mid-sprint a critical bug comes in, a new backlog item is created and possibly brought into the current work in EPMT (and maybe one lower priority item is moved out).
7. **Review & Close:** At the end of the sprint/release, all done items are marked “Done” and possibly filtered out of the active backlog view (though still accessible via a Done filter or archived). The PM might review any incomplete items and reprioritize them for future. They also ensure that any done items that came from ideas get their linked idea updated (the integration could handle that – e.g., if backlog item is done and had origin idea, mark idea as completed).
8. **Continuous Updates:** The backlog is a living list. New items keep coming (from new ideas or new technical needs), and old items get completed or pruned. The PM regularly re-scores or re-orders items as conditions change (e.g., if a competitor releases a feature, an item to match that might jump in priority). The tool’s combination of manual ordering and scoring frameworks supports these dynamic changes.

Throughout this process, the backlog module ensures the team always knows **what’s on deck** and why. By capturing priority reasoning (scores, tags) and linking strategic context (epics, initiatives), it avoids the backlog becoming just a dumping ground – instead it’s an actively managed queue aligned with strategic goals. Real-time collaboration features (comments, notifications) make sure everyone is on the same page when changes happen.

**Dependencies & Integration (Backlog):** This module integrates tightly with others: with Ideas (for input), with Roadmap (for scheduling into releases), with Resource Management (for checking assignments) and with external dev tools (for execution). A key integration: if using Jira, each backlog item in EPMT corresponds to a Jira issue. The requirements for integration are covered later, but in short, the backlog must expose APIs and possibly webhooks to sync with external systems. For example, a webhook could notify EPMT when a Jira issue transitions to Done, so EPMT updates its status. Conversely, if a PM reprioritizes the backlog in EPMT, it might push an updated “rank” or custom field to Jira for consistency (some tools use a rank field for ordering). Another consideration is if multiple projects (e.g., front-end vs back-end teams) exist, the backlog might be segmented or filtered by team, but ideally keep one unified view with tags for team ownership. The design should account for multiple development teams working off the same product backlog, a common scenario in large enterprises.

## Product Roadmapping Module

**Description:** The Roadmapping module provides tools to create and share **visual product roadmaps** that illustrate how the product will evolve over time. A roadmap is a timeline view of key product initiatives, features, and releases, aligned with dates or time periods and optionally linked to strategic objectives. This module allows product managers to plan the sequencing of features and to communicate these plans to various stakeholders (e.g., executives, other departments, and customers) in an easily understandable format. Roadmaps help track progress at a high level and ensure that day-to-day development aligns with long-term goals. The EPMT roadmapping module must handle multiple levels of detail (from company-level product strategy down to specific release contents) and multiple audiences (internal versus external views), all while staying updated as the backlog executes.

&#x20;_Illustrative product roadmap timeline showing goals, initiatives, and feature releases over the first half of 2024._ In this example, each row represents a product or team, and colored bars represent features or epics scheduled in particular months, with their progress indicated. Milestones (vertical markers) and percentage-complete bars show current status. The Roadmapping module in EPMT will enable creation of similar timeline visuals, where users can see at a glance what is planned when, and how it ties to high-level goals (e.g., each feature bar is aligned under a goal such as “Expand global markets”, with a success metric).

**Key Features & Requirements:**

- **Multiple Roadmap Views:** Users should be able to create different roadmap views (or types) for different purposes. Common roadmap view types might include:

  - _Timeline by Releases:_ showing each planned release on a time axis with key features in it.
  - _Timeline by Epics/Features:_ showing when each major feature or epic will be worked on/delivered.
  - _Goals or Initiatives Roadmap:_ a higher-level view linking strategic goals to deliverables (e.g., each bar is an initiative, composed of features, mapped to goals).
  - _Portfolio Roadmap:_ if multiple products/projects are managed, a view that shows parallel tracks for each product line or team and how their releases align.
  - _External Roadmap:_ a simplified view (no exact dates or internal details) intended for customers, highlighting upcoming features in general timeframes (e.g., by quarter).
    The module should allow creation of custom views with selectable criteria (e.g., filter to one product, or only certain categories of work). Possibly provide templates for these common types.

- **Timeline & Gantt Chart Representation:** The roadmap is essentially a high-level Gantt chart. The UI needs to support a timeline (horizontal axis calendar). Users can plot items (features, epics, releases) as bars spanning from a start date to an end date (or as milestones on a single date for events like a launch date). The timeline should be zoomable or scalable (e.g., view by weeks, months, quarters). For product roadmaps, often a **quarterly view** or monthly view is appropriate. Ensure the timeline can scroll into the future (e.g., plan a year ahead or more) and into the past to show what was delivered.
- **Items on the Roadmap:** What goes on the roadmap? It could be:

  - **Releases:** Each release (version) can be displayed, possibly as a milestone or a container of features.
  - **Features/Epics:** High-level work items (often epics) can be shown as bars indicating when development is happening and when delivery is expected. These can derive from the Backlog (e.g. an epic in backlog has a start and end date or sprint span).
  - **Initiatives/Projects:** A grouping of features, often aligned to a goal, shown as a longer-running bar that spans multiple releases.
    We should allow at least one level of grouping: e.g., if an initiative contains features, the roadmap can show the initiative bar with the features as sub-bars within it. Or if an epic contains stories, maybe roll up to epic level on roadmap.

- **Drag-and-Drop Scheduling:** Users (PMs) can interactively schedule an item by dragging its bar along the timeline or extending/contracting it to adjust duration. For example, if an epic is initially planned Jan–Feb, but gets delayed, the PM can drag its bar to Feb–Mar. When doing so, ideally a prompt could appear to adjust associated dates or releases (e.g., if you drag beyond a release boundary, maybe suggest updating the release date). Under the hood, changing a roadmap bar should update the underlying data (e.g., update the target release date of the associated backlog items or mark that timeline shift). Real-time collaboration: if someone is viewing the roadmap, they should eventually see updates another user makes.
- **Milestones and Key Dates:** Allow adding milestone markers on the roadmap (for example, “Beta launch”, “Conference demo”, “Release 2.0 GA”). These are single-day points of interest. They might be independent or attached to specific roadmap items. Visually, maybe as diamonds or flags on the timeline. They help communicate deadlines or events.
- **Progress Tracking:** On each roadmap item, indicate progress. If an item corresponds to an epic with child backlog items, progress could be calculated (e.g., 5 of 10 stories done = 50%). This can be shown as a fill on the bar or a percentage label. Alternatively, color coding (e.g., green bar for on track, yellow for slight risk, red for major risk) could be used if statuses are assigned. EPMT should fetch status info from backlog to automatically update roadmap progress. For example, if a bar (feature) spans four weeks and the current date is halfway but work is only 20% done, maybe flag it. At minimum, let the PM manually mark a roadmap item’s status (On Track, At Risk, etc.) which reflects via color or icon.
- **Alignment with Goals:** It’s beneficial to display how roadmap items tie to product goals or OKRs. This could be done by grouping or labeling. For instance, each feature bar could have a label of the goal it supports, or the lanes on the roadmap could be goals with features listed under them. If goals are managed in the system (maybe in a strategy section), linking roadmap items to goals provides traceability (for stakeholders to see “why are we doing this feature? Oh, it’s to achieve Goal X (e.g., increase international markets by 5%)”). The Aha example shows a “Goal progress” roadmap where each goal had a progress metric. For v1, at least include a field on roadmap items for Goal/Initiative and allow filtering or grouping by it.
- **Multiple Swimlanes or Rows:** The roadmap might need multiple rows or swimlanes to represent either different teams, products, or categories of work in parallel. For example, a portfolio roadmap might have one row per product, or an internal roadmap might have separate lanes for frontend vs backend team deliverables. The tool should allow creating lanes based on a property (like an “Owner Team” field) or manual lanes. At least allow dividing by product if multi-product.
- **Annotations & Details:** Each roadmap item (bar) should show a name (e.g., feature name or epic name). Possibly allow an additional short description or tags on the bar. On hover or click, a detailed pop-up can show more info (e.g., description, % done, link to backlog items, owner, etc.). This helps viewers get context without leaving the roadmap.
- **Editing & Sync with Backlog:** Changes in roadmap should reflect in backlog planning. If I move a feature’s date on the roadmap, perhaps it should update a field on the backlog items (like “target release” or “iteration”). Conversely, if backlog items get done early or a release date changes, the roadmap should update. This requires integration logic: maybe treat the roadmap as a presentation layer that reads from backlog. But often PMs adjust roadmap independently to do higher-level planning before committing to backlog changes. For v1, allow manual editing on either side, but provide guidance to keep them consistent (like a visual indicator if roadmap vs backlog dates are out of sync). Possibly include a “Last updated” and “by who” note to avoid confusion.
- **Versioning & History:** Because roadmaps can change, it might be useful to track history or versions. For instance, the ability to capture a snapshot of the roadmap at a point in time (like “Q1 Plan”) and then allow updates, so that one can refer back to original plan. This might be advanced for initial version, but at least keep a change log (who changed what date when).
- **Sharing and Exporting:** The roadmap is often shared beyond the tool. Provide capabilities to export the roadmap view to common formats: e.g., PDF or image for inclusion in slide decks, or an online shareable link. The shareable link is great for external stakeholders – perhaps an **interactive view** with limited access (like view-only, hide confidential details) for people without full accounts. For external roadmaps, one should be able to publish a sanitized version (no internal code names or exact dates if not desired). Possibly integrate with Confluence or others by embedding the roadmap there via iFrame or an integration.
- **External vs Internal Roadmap Views:** Mark certain items or details as internal-only. For example, internal roadmap might have exact dates and detailed feature names, whereas external might just say “UI Improvements – Q4” without giving exact commitments. The tool could allow each roadmap item to have a “visibility” setting (Public/Private) or simply maintain separate roadmap objects for external sharing. For v1, simplest is maintain two roadmap documents if needed, but that duplicates work. Perhaps better: one master but an ability to toggle view mode to hide certain things (like a flag on items “Hide from external”).
- **Roadmap Item Creation:** Users should be able to create roadmap entries not necessarily tied one-to-one with backlog items. Sometimes PMs want to put a placeholder on the roadmap (“Performance improvements phase 1”) before it’s broken into concrete backlog items. So allow adding a generic roadmap bar with just a title and timeframe. Later, one can link it to backlog items (maybe attach multiple items to a single roadmap bar). The linking could allow aggregated progress calculation. But if linking is too complex, at least allow free-form entries on the roadmap.
- **Roadmap Analytics:** Provide a way to quickly see how the roadmap aligns with capacity and goals. For example, show how many features per quarter, or how each quarter’s load compares (maybe by story points or count). Or if goals are linked: e.g., have a pie or bar chart of effort per strategic initiative. This might be more in reporting, but the roadmap data should be queryable for these insights.
- **Notifications:** If someone is subscribed to changes (maybe a stakeholder wants to know if roadmap changes), allow notifications when roadmap dates slip or items are added/removed. This could be an opt-in thing.

**User Stories (Roadmapping):**

- _As a Product Manager, I want to create a visual timeline of upcoming releases and features, so that I can communicate the product plan to stakeholders and the development team._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ I can create a new roadmap view (e.g., “Product X Roadmap 2024”) and define its scope (Product X, and covering Q1–Q4 2024, for instance). I can add items to the roadmap by selecting existing features/epics from the backlog or by creating new entries. For each item, I can specify a start and end date (or duration). Once added, the item appears as a bar on the timeline. I can move it left or right (changing start date) and stretch or shrink it (changing end date). If I add an item representing a release, I can set it to a specific date (milestone). The timeline clearly shows the items in chronological order on a calendar grid. I can label the bars with their name and perhaps the team or product area if multi-lane. After constructing it, I can save the roadmap and switch into a “view mode” that hides editing controls, suitable for sharing.

- _As an executive stakeholder, I want to see a high-level roadmap that highlights major upcoming features and how they tie to strategic goals, without needing to delve into technical details, so that I understand the direction and status of product development._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ I can access a read-only view (likely via a share link or login with Stakeholder role) of the roadmap. The view shows, for example, quarters on the timeline, and under each quarter, the names of key initiatives or features planned. Each item might have an icon or color denoting its strategic goal (maybe a legend shows Goal A in blue, Goal B in green). The view does not show minor tasks or exact dates, keeping it abstract (e.g., “Q3: Beta of Feature Y”). If an item is running late, perhaps it’s visually flagged (maybe an icon or color indicating risk). I can also toggle to see progress (how much of Q2’s items are done already). I should not see internal notes, just titles and maybe short descriptions of features. This story’s criteria is met if an executive can, in one page or screen, understand what’s planned for the next few quarters, what’s been completed recently, and the general status, all aligned to business goals.

- _As a Product Manager, I want to adjust the roadmap when priorities or timelines change (e.g., a feature is delayed to the next quarter), and have those changes reflected to all viewers and linked plans, so that everyone stays up-to-date._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ Suppose Feature A was planned to finish in Q1 but will slip to Q2. I can click and drag Feature A’s bar to extend into Q2. The system might warn if it conflicts with something (e.g., if the same team had another item that overlaps, but that might be fine). Once I drop it in the new position, the roadmap is updated and saved. Any user viewing this roadmap will now see Feature A in Q2. Additionally, if Feature A was associated with a release, maybe its release assignment is updated to “Release 1.1 in Q2” automatically (if configured). If this feature had linked backlog items, perhaps their “target release” field is updated as well, or at least a notification is given: “Consider updating backlog dates for Feature A”. The acceptance is that editing the timeline is easy and the data remains consistent (no ghost of old Q1 date remains). Possibly, an update log is generated (“Feature A moved to Q2 by PM at time X”) for traceability.

- _As a Sales or Customer Success team member, I want to share a subset of the roadmap with a customer to show them when their requested features might be delivered, without revealing confidential or tentative plans, so that I maintain trust and transparency appropriately._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ The tool allows generating an **external roadmap** view or export that includes select items. For example, I can choose to export a roadmap that only shows items marked as “Customer Visible = Yes”. Items flagged internal are omitted. Also, exact dates can be hidden, showing just months or quarters (“Coming Q4 2025” rather than “Nov 15, 2025”). I can then share either a PDF or a live link with the customer. The customer sees a neat timeline of upcoming items relevant to them (perhaps even personalized to their requests, if we filter that way). There is no sensitive info like internal code names or technical details. Ideally, the interface for generating this external view is user-friendly: maybe the PM or admin can maintain an “External Roadmap” version in the tool that automatically stays in sync with the main one but with filtered content. If not automatic, at least a manual selection and one-click export. This story is satisfied if, for instance, a sales engineer can log in, open the external roadmap for Product X, and confidently share it via screen or email with a client, knowing it’s pre-sanitized.

- _As a Product Manager, I want to see the capacity and load in each timeframe on the roadmap to ensure we are not over-committing (e.g., too many big features in one quarter for our team size), so that the plans are realistic._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ The roadmap interface could display a summary of effort per time period. For example, under each quarter label, it might show “Planned effort: 50 points; Team capacity: 40 points” in red if overbooked. This requires that items on the roadmap have an effort size (like aggregated story points) and that team velocity or capacity is known (from Resource module). If an overload is detected, the PM might adjust (move some feature to next quarter). Alternatively, if no auto-calculation, at least the PM can manually gauge by looking at how many large bars overlap. But to meet this story, some visual cue or report is expected. So the acceptance would be: given the resource capacity data, the roadmap can highlight overcommitments. If I try to schedule more work than available, the system warns or shows it. For instance, if Q1 has 5 major epics scheduled and our team historically does 3, maybe a small warning icon appears near the Q1 label or on items beyond the capacity threshold.

- _As an Engineering Manager or Developer, I want to understand how my current work relates to the roadmap, so that I have context for why we are doing it and what’s coming next._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ Team members can view the roadmap (at least the internal one) and see where their current sprint or tasks fit. For example, if I’m working on Feature A, I can see on the roadmap that Feature A is part of “Q2 release” and perhaps linked to a goal of improving user retention. This provides context. The acceptance is somewhat subjective, but at minimum if a developer opens the roadmap, they should recognize items that correspond to their backlog tasks and see the big picture timeline. Possibly the integration would highlight “In Progress” items on the roadmap differently (like blinking or outlined) to show that’s what currently being worked on.

**Workflow – Roadmap Planning and Maintenance:**

1. **Initial Roadmap Creation:** At the start of a planning cycle (say annually or quarterly), the Product Manager creates a new roadmap document. They define the timeframe (e.g., the upcoming year) and key milestones (perhaps fixed dates like conferences or major version launch dates). They then populate it with high-level items: e.g., Feature A in Q1, Feature B in Q2, etc., based on strategy and backlog priorities. They link these to goals if possible (for instance, label Feature A as contributing to Goal “Improve NPS”).
2. **Review with Leadership:** The PM presents this draft roadmap to execs for feedback. Maybe they decide Feature B should be pulled in earlier due to market pressure. The PM moves Feature B’s bar from Q3 to Q2. To accommodate, maybe Feature C is pushed out. They adjust until leadership is satisfied with the big picture.
3. **Team Validation:** The PM then reviews the roadmap with the engineering team leads. They check feasibility – e.g., Team says Feature B also needs some prerequisite work not accounted for. So maybe an additional item (Feature B prep work) is added in Q1. Or they say Q2 already looks too packed for their team of 5. The PM sees capacity warning or trusts their judgement and moves a less critical item to Q3. They also assign owners if needed (maybe different lanes by team).
4. **Publish Roadmap:** Once agreed, the roadmap is published internally (all team can view it). Perhaps an external version is also prepared for key customers or the user community, highlighting the upcoming quarter’s major features.
5. **Ongoing Updates:** As development progresses, the PM updates the roadmap: if an item is completed early, they mark it done (bar might turn solid or green). If something is delayed, adjust its bar or move it to next timeframe. They do this in sync with backlog changes – e.g., if backlog indicates a slip, reflect on roadmap. Or if roadmap change (like decision to add a new feature in Q3), they add that item and then go create backlog items for it. Regularly (maybe monthly), the PM reviews the roadmap to ensure it’s current. They also update progress percentages, either manually or via the tool’s auto-calc from backlog status.
6. **Stakeholder Communication:** The roadmap can be used in status meetings. For example, a quarterly product review meeting might open the roadmap and quickly show which initiatives are on track or behind. Because the roadmap items show progress, the PM can say “Feature A is 80% done, we’re on track for end of March”. If something is behind, they might have flagged it at risk and discuss mitigation.
7. **Versioning if needed:** If big changes happen, the PM might save a copy (in case they need to compare to original promise). But likely, they will just communicate changes via release notes or directly to stakeholders (“We decided to move Feature X out by one quarter due to new priorities.”).
8. **Roadmap to Backlog sync:** Whenever the roadmap is adjusted, the PM ensures any corresponding backlog items have their metadata updated (like release or sprint assignment). Conversely, after each sprint or release, they mark delivered items as completed on the roadmap. Ideally, this sync is partly automated or at least clearly indicated in the UI so they don’t miss anything.

This workflow highlights that roadmapping is a continuous process, not a one-time plan. EPMT’s Roadmap module should make it as easy as possible to adjust plans and immediately reflect those changes to everyone. It helps maintain alignment: devs know the broad timeline, executives see that plans are being executed (or changed with rationale), and external stakeholders see transparency into upcoming features without overcommitment to exact dates.

**Integration & Data (Roadmap):** The Roadmap ties closely with Backlog and Release Analytics. In an integrated scenario, there might be an option to auto-populate the roadmap from backlog data: e.g., if backlog items have a “Planned Sprint/Release” field with dates, the system could generate a roadmap view out-of-the-box. However, giving PMs manual control is important for a curated presentation. The Roadmap module should pull data like progress from backlog (e.g., count of done tasks for an epic) and push data like changed dates to backlog (if chosen). For external calendar integration: maybe allow exporting roadmap dates to Outlook/Google Calendar (e.g., a milestone’s date as a calendar event for launch – this might be something an individual does via export). Also, if using a specialized roadmapping tool or if need to import an existing roadmap, consider import/export to formats like CSV or integration with tools like ProductPlan (for migration). But likely not needed if EPMT is the primary tool.

By having robust roadmapping within EPMT, product teams eliminate the need to maintain separate PowerPoints or spreadsheets for roadmap visuals – saving effort and ensuring consistency with the backlog and actual progress.

## Resource Allocation & Capacity Planning Module

**Description:** The Resource Allocation module focuses on **optimizing the assignment of work to team members**. In an enterprise environment, product development often involves multiple teams and individuals with specialized skills. This module helps answer questions like “Who is available to work on this feature?” and “Do we have enough frontend engineers to deliver these five features this quarter?”. It uses data about each employee’s skills, current workload, and availability to inform task assignments and scheduling. The goal is to ensure that tasks are allocated to the **right people** and that no individual or team is overburdened or sitting idle, thereby improving efficiency and throughput.

This module encompasses **capacity planning** – understanding how much work can be done in a given timeframe – and **resource scheduling** – assigning specific people to specific tasks or time slots. It may present views such as calendars or workload charts for team members. It’s typically used by product managers in coordination with engineering managers or project managers to plan sprints and releases realistically.

**Key Features & Requirements:**

- **Team & User Profiles:** The system should maintain a profile for each team member (user) that includes relevant data for resource planning: their role/position, skill set/expertise, normal work capacity (e.g., 40 hours per week or 8 points per sprint), and current allocation. Skills could be a list of tags like “Java”, “UX Design”, “QA Automation” with proficiency levels perhaps. Also include working hours or time-zone if relevant (for distributed teams). For capacity, perhaps a default hours per week and an option to adjust if someone is part-time.
- **Availability & Time Off:** Allow tracking of individual availability changes, such as vacations, holidays, or other leaves. For example, an integrated calendar where an admin/manager can mark “Alice on PTO from Aug 10 to Aug 20”, which reduces her capacity in that period to 0. Alternatively, integrate with an HR system or at least allow manual input of non-working days. Public holidays could be input (perhaps via calendar integration) to reduce capacity for all on those days. This ensures the planning engine knows when someone isn’t around.
- **Capacity Planning (Team-Level):** Provide a view where for a given iteration (say a sprint or month), you see how much work (in story points or hours) is assigned versus available for each team or individual. For example, if Team A has 100 points capacity this quarter and currently 120 points worth of work assigned, flag that overcapacity. Or at an individual level: Alice can do 10 points this sprint, she currently has tasks totaling 8 points (under capacity, good) or 15 (overloaded). The system should sum up assigned tasks’ estimates for each person in each time period.
- **Assignment Suggestions:** When assigning a task (backlog item) to a developer, the system could suggest who might be best suited based on skill match and current load. For instance, if a task is tagged “Backend” and requires skill “Java”, the system could list backend engineers who have Java skill, sorted by who has the most available capacity. It might show each candidate with a simple indicator (e.g., available bandwidth this sprint or next). The PM/EM can then pick an assignee informed by this. This might be a semi-automated step – not fully auto-assign (unless the org wants auto, but likely manual with suggestions).
- **Workload Visualization:** A calendar or timeline view (Gantt-like or heatmap) that shows each team member’s allocated tasks over time. For example, a grid with team members as rows and days/weeks as columns, with blocks representing tasks assigned. This allows spotting conflicts (two tasks overlapping for one person) or free gaps. Alternatively or additionally, a chart per person that shows utilization percentage over upcoming weeks. If a person is consistently above 100%, that’s a problem; if well below, maybe they can take more tasks. Tools often have a heatmap: e.g., green if utilization 0-80%, yellow 80-100%, red >100%.
- **Integration with Backlog Scheduling:** The resource module should connect with backlog and roadmap. When scheduling tasks for a sprint or release, one might allocate who will do them. Ideally, the tool could auto-distribute tasks in a sprint among the team given certain constraints. But for v1, likely manual assignment aided by data. For instance, during sprint planning, the EM opens a “Sprint Capacity” view in EPMT: it lists all team members with capacity and all tasks to assign. They then drag tasks onto members until everyone is filled near their limit. The system might warn if over assignment. Once assigned, those tasks now have an assignee field set (and maybe the sprint field set, which they already had). This might double as a **sprint planning board** focusing on resource load rather than just story list.
- **Cross-team Planning:** In a large enterprise, some features require multiple teams (e.g., front-end and back-end). The module should allow filtering by team or viewing multiple teams to coordinate. Possibly a mode to see overall organization capacity as well. But at least handle multiple teams sequentially or side by side.
- **Role-based Allocation:** Sometimes planning is at role level first (e.g., “We need 3 developer-weeks and 1 QA-week for this feature”). The tool might allow resource placeholders like “Developer TBD” assigned with an effort, which can later be replaced by a specific person. Or at least track by roles: e.g., see that QA capacity is insufficient in a certain sprint if too many testing tasks coincide. This is advanced, but consider at least grouping by role in the views.
- **Resource Pools & Teams:** There may be concept of teams (e.g., Team Alpha, Team Beta). Each team has certain members and collectively a capacity. The PM might plan at team level (like allocate an epic to Team Alpha in Q1, trusting them to distribute among themselves). The tool should model teams: allow grouping users into teams, and planning at that level (like Team Alpha has 5 devs, so capacity of 50 points per sprint). Then maybe break down to individuals in detail if needed.
- **Utilization Reports:** Over time, produce reports such as average utilization per person or how often tasks get reassigned, etc. For v1, perhaps out of scope, but mention the need: E.g., an engineering director might want to see if any team is consistently over capacity or which skills are bottlenecks (maybe one particular skillset person is overloaded because only they can do certain tasks). The system can highlight that if tracked (like Bob has unique skill X and always 120% utilized, maybe need to hire or train others). This is insightful for planning and hiring.
- **What-If Analysis:** Capacity planning often involves scenarios. Perhaps allow a sandbox mode: e.g., if we add 5 more points of work in next sprint, what happens? Or if Bob goes on leave, how does it impact? While full simulation might be complex, even the ability to temporarily mark someone unavailable and see effect, or to adjust an item’s estimate and see who could take it, is useful. Possibly not fully automated but easily manually tweakable to test.
- **Notification of Overload:** If at any point tasks assigned to someone exceed their available time in a period, the system should flag it. For example, if a PM tries to assign a new story to Alice in Sprint 5 but Alice is already at 100%, a warning or prompt occurs. They can override (maybe she can do overtime or they shift something else), but at least informed. Similarly, if a resource becomes unavailable (she takes vacation) the tasks during that period might highlight as unstaffed or needing reallocation.
- **Non-Engineering Resources:** Consider if any non-developer resources need planning (like UX designers or technical writers) – likely yes. The tool should be flexible to include those roles in resource pool if they are part of the product development process. For example, if a designer is needed for a certain feature during a certain week, assign that too. So not just developers, but any team member type. Possibly allow linking a task to multiple people (one as primary dev, one as UX, one QA?), or create separate tasks for each role under a feature (e.g., “Design for Feature X” assigned to designer, “Testing for Feature X” to QA). Up to process, but tool should not be dev-only centric.
- **Time Tracking Integration (if any):** While EPMT is not a time tracking tool, if integrated with one (or if tasks have a log of hours spent), the resource module could compare planned vs actual. For instance, after a sprint, see that Bob was planned for 30h but logged 45h, indicating underestimation or inefficiency. For v1, time tracking is optional, but keep open possibility to pull actuals for analysis.

**User Stories (Resource Allocation):**

- _As an Engineering Manager, I want to see how many tasks each developer is assigned for the next sprint and whether it fits in their capacity, so that I can adjust assignments before the sprint begins._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ I navigate to the Resource Planning view for “Sprint 10” (or a specific two-week window). It shows a list or table of each team member (filtered to my team perhaps) with their capacity (say in points or hours) and the tasks currently assigned to them for that sprint. For example: Alice – Capacity 10 points, Assigned 12 points (120% – highlighted red); Bob – Capacity 8, Assigned 6 (75% – green); Carol – Capacity 8, Assigned 8 (100% – yellow). The interface highlights Alice’s overload. I can then take action: perhaps reassign one of Alice’s tasks to Bob. I drag one of Alice’s tasks (or use an assign action on it) to Bob. The numbers update: Alice now maybe 100%, Bob becomes 100% as well. All green or yellow now. I commit those changes. The acceptance is successful if I can easily identify over-allocations and fix them by redistributing work, with immediate feedback on utilization changes.

- _As a Product Manager, I want to ensure that for the next release we have the necessary skill sets available for all planned work, so that we don't schedule something that no one can execute._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ When planning a release’s tasks, I assign required skills or roles to each major task (could be derived from the task type or tags). The resource module can generate a “skill coverage” report: e.g., Release 2.0 has 5 tasks needing “iOS development” (total estimated 100 hours) and we have 2 iOS developers available in that period for maybe 80 hours – that shows a shortfall. The system might highlight skill areas that are under-resourced relative to plan. Alternatively, when trying to assign an iOS task, if no iOS dev is free, the suggestion list might be empty or show all iOS devs overloaded. The acceptance is that the system should make obvious any gap in matching people to tasks by skill. If, say, a specialized task is created and only Bob has that skill, and Bob is already booked, the PM/EM is alerted that either schedule must change or someone else must be trained/hired.

- _As a Team Lead, I want to allocate a percentage of time for each developer to maintenance tasks and ensure new feature work doesn’t consume 100% of their capacity, so that important background tasks and support can still happen._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ The tool allows me to reserve some capacity for each person for “other duties” (maybe not explicitly, but one approach: only treat, say, 80% of their time as available for planned tasks). Alternatively, I can input a dummy task like “Maintenance” assigned to everyone that takes 20% capacity. The acceptance: in the resource view, even if a person has theoretically 40h, it only shows 32h available for new tasks because 8h is in maintenance. Then I ensure I don't plan beyond 32h of feature work for them. The tool should accommodate such nuance, perhaps by letting me set each person's availability in a sprint (like Bob is only allocated 4 of 5 days to project tasks, 1 day support). If I try to assign beyond that, it flags overload. The acceptance is satisfied if I can either explicitly or conceptually allocate partial capacity to non-project work and the system respects that when showing availability.

- _As a Product Manager, when scheduling a new feature that spans multiple sprints, I want to allocate different parts of the work to different team members according to their specialties (e.g., backend to one, frontend to another), so that the work is done by the best-suited people and in parallel where possible._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ Suppose Feature X has two components: frontend UI and backend API. I create two sub-tasks or simply two entries in resource plan for Feature X – one requiring “Frontend Dev” skill, \~5 days, another requiring “Backend Dev” skill, \~5 days. The tool shows me available frontend devs and backend devs over the timeframe (maybe it's a 4-week feature). I assign John (frontend) to the UI part and Jane (backend) to the API part, possibly even overlapping their work in the schedule (the visual timeline for assignments would show John working week1-2 on UI, Jane week1-2 on API concurrently, if they can). The schedule now has Feature X planned with both resources allocated appropriately. If I only had one person, maybe they'd do sequentially. The acceptance is that I can break down the work by skill if needed and allocate to separate people, and the system handles overlapping assignments as long as it's different people. The timeline view might show a bar for Feature X with segments labeled John and Jane or separate but grouped by feature. This ensures specialization is respected.

- _As a Developer, I want to be notified if I am assigned to more work than I can handle in an upcoming period, so that I can discuss adjustments with my manager._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ If at any point my assignment exceeds 100% for a coming sprint or week, the system should send me an alert (and possibly alert the assigner too). For example, if after planning Sprint 5, I (Alice) log in and see a notification: “You have been assigned 50 hours of work for Sprint 5, which exceeds your capacity of 40 hours. Please review with your manager.” This could appear in my dashboard or email. The acceptance is satisfied if an over-allocation triggers an alert automatically. Optionally, even being at 100% could warn (like “at full capacity, no buffer”). If I’m under, no alert. This way, developers are aware of expectations and can raise flags early if something seems off (maybe tasks were estimated too low, etc.).

- _As a Project Manager (or a Scrum Master), I want to visualize the plan for the next quarter, including who is working on what and when, so that I can communicate the execution plan and ensure no one is double-booked across projects._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ The module can produce a timeline (e.g., a Gantt chart by person) for the next quarter. Each person’s row shows the tasks or projects they are assigned to, laid out on the calendar. If a person is assigned to two projects in overlapping time, it will show two bars overlapping on their row (likely flagged). Ideally, that shouldn't happen if we allocated properly. For instance, it should show that Dev A works on Feature 1 in Jan, then Feature 2 in Feb-Mar, etc., while Dev B is on Feature 2 Jan-Feb, then Feature 3, etc. I can export or print this as “Resource plan Q1”. The acceptance: a clear visualization exists for a time range with tasks per person, confirming the allocation. It might also allow grouping by team or filtering to only specific team members if the org is huge.

**Workflow – Resource Planning in Sprint and Release Cycles:**

1. **Pre-planning Data Setup:** At the start, ensure all team members are in the system with correct capacity settings. The admin or manager enters any known absences (e.g., Bob’s vacation next month) into the tool. They also ensure tasks (backlog items) have estimates. If any tasks lack owners or estimates, that’s highlighted for PM to address.
2. **Sprint Planning Meeting:** The team comes with a list of stories to include (from backlog, chosen by PM). Using EPMT, the EM opens the sprint planning/resource view. It shows all the chosen stories (with their point estimates) and the team members’ available points. The EM and team collaboratively assign stories: e.g., “Alice and Bob, can you take these 3 stories? Alice takes story X, Bob takes Y and Z.” The EM in the tool assigns accordingly. As each assignment is made, the tool updates the running total for each person. If someone goes over capacity, they reconsider – maybe swap a story to someone else or move it to next sprint. They iterate until all selected stories are assigned and everyone is at or under capacity (maybe a little under to have a buffer or account for unforeseen tasks). They notice QA is a bottleneck – only one QA for many stories, so they plan that QA will focus on the critical ones and developers will help test the others, or they reduce scope. The tool’s data made that visible. They finalize assignments.
3. **During Sprint Execution:** As the sprint proceeds, if new tasks come (like bugs), the PM/EM can see who has slack. E.g., Carol has only 60% load, so she can take an unplanned bug. They assign Carol the bug in EPMT. If someone falls sick mid-sprint, EM reassigns their tasks to others if possible, again checking capacity (someone might then become overloaded, so maybe drop a story). EPMT helps do this quickly and tracks the changes.
4. **Release / Long-term Planning:** For a broader horizon (quarter or multiple sprints), PM uses the roadmap to lay out features by timeframe, and the resource module to check if enough resources. For example, Q1 has two big features requiring a lot of backend work. The resource view for Q1 might show backend team’s total load. If it’s too high, PM either pushes one feature to Q2 or sees if another team can help. They also maybe identify need for extra hiring if consistently overloaded. This is more high-level, but EPMT can support by allowing viewing combined capacity of the entire team vs planned tasks for the quarter (like summing all story estimates for Q1 assignments vs total dev capacity of team across Q1). If that sum is over, it’s an immediate sign to adjust the plan.
5. **Recurring Process:** Each sprint, this module is used to allocate tasks. Over time, it can also give insights: e.g., "We notice Alice is always near 120% while Bob is at 70% – maybe Bob can learn some of Alice’s skills or we shift responsibilities." This might be noticed in retrospective using utilization report. Also, after each release, they might adjust capacity values if they learned the team’s true velocity is different than assumed. EPMT should allow updating person’s capacity or velocity settings easily.
6. **Cross-project Resource Handling:** If one person works on two products (rare but possible in enterprise), the tool should accumulate their tasks from both. For example, if Jane splits time 50/50 on two products, the admin might set her capacity in each or overall. Ideally, an overall view would catch if combined assignments exceed total. EPMT’s multi-project design should consider a person unique globally. The resource module likely would be global or per group, so an EM overseeing one product might not see tasks from another product assigned to Jane, which could cause underestimation of her load. Possibly in enterprise, they avoid sharing people across projects for this reason, but the tool could at least warn if double-booking occurs (if known).

The Resource Allocation module ensures that planning is **grounded in reality** – that timelines from the roadmap and tasks from the backlog are matched with actual people to do the work. By aligning tasks with availability, it helps prevent scenarios where plans look good on paper but are impossible to execute with given staffing. It also supports fairness and sustainability by avoiding overloading individuals.

**Integration (Resource Management):** This module might integrate with HR systems (to get org chart, holidays), with calendar tools (Outlook for vacation maybe), and with the backlog (which it obviously does, since tasks come from backlog). Also, if the company uses a specialized tool for time tracking (like Harvest or Jira’s time logs), integrating those could provide actual hours used to refine capacity assumptions. Another integration point is with **directory/SSO** – ensuring all users are synced. A nice-to-have integration: Slack or Teams notifications if someone’s assigned something or if they get overloaded (since resource planning outcomes might be communicated via chat). The module's data could also be exported to spreadsheets if managers want to do custom analysis or reports outside.

## User Feedback & Bug Tracking Integration Module

**Description:** The User Feedback & Bug Tracking module covers how EPMT handles **incoming feedback from users and defect reports**. This area ensures that user insights and quality issues are captured and integrated into the product planning process. It can be split into two sub-areas: **User Feedback Analytics** and **Bug Tracking**. The requirement emphasizes that the product either provides these natively or integrates with existing tools, which means EPMT should be flexible depending on the enterprise’s current tool stack.

For **User Feedback Analytics:** This involves collecting qualitative or quantitative feedback from users – such as survey responses, NPS scores, in-app feedback messages, support tickets, usage analytics – and making sense of them. The goal is to inform product decisions with real user data: identifying pain points, frequently requested improvements (which overlaps with Idea Management), and user satisfaction trends. This might include sentiment analysis, categorization of feedback, and linking feedback to features or ideas.

For **Bug Tracking:** It involves capturing bug reports (from QA or users), prioritizing them, and ensuring they are addressed in the backlog. Many enterprises use dedicated bug trackers (like JIRA, which is also used for stories, or other tools like Bugzilla, etc.). EPMT should not necessarily replace those but rather integrate, so the product team has visibility on the **status and volume of defects** and can consider them in prioritization alongside new features.

**Key Features & Requirements (Feedback):**

- **Feedback Capture Channels:** Provide ways to ingest user feedback into EPMT. This could be through:

  - An **in-app feedback widget/SDK** that developers can embed into their product, allowing end-users to submit feedback directly. If EPMT offers this, it would route submissions to a feedback inbox in EPMT (similar to how idea portal works, but possibly for more free-form feedback or bug reports by users).
  - **Integrations with support systems:** e.g., connect with Zendesk, Intercom, or Salesforce Service Cloud, so that when a support ticket is labeled as product feedback or feature request, it gets fed into EPMT automatically.
  - **Surveys and NPS:** Integration or simple capture of NPS (Net Promoter Score) or CSAT survey results. If the company runs surveys (like via SurveyMonkey or an in-app tool), EPMT could import the results or at least let PM manually input some metrics.
  - **App Store Reviews or Social Media:** Possibly beyond v1, but companies might parse app store reviews for feedback. EPMT could allow import of those (via a CSV or API).
    In v1, focusing on integration with at least one primary feedback source (e.g., Zendesk tickets or an in-app form) is likely enough.

- **Feedback Repository & Dashboard:** All feedback items (not structured ideas, but general feedback) should be accessible in a list or dashboard. Each feedback item might have: date, user info (if known), feedback text, category/tag, source (e.g. “Zendesk ticket #1234” or “In-app feedback”), and possibly sentiment (if auto-analyzed). The PM can filter these, search text, or group them to find common threads. Perhaps integrate a simple sentiment analysis: e.g., mark feedback as Positive/Negative/Neutral based on keywords or external service.

- **Link Feedback to Ideas/Backlog:** The PM should be able to take a user feedback item and associate it with an existing idea or backlog item. For example, if 10 different feedback entries all mention “I wish the app had dark mode”, the PM can link them all to the “Dark Mode feature” idea in Idea module. The system could then show count of linked feedback (like “This feature request has 10 customer feedbacks attached”). This helps quantify demand. If feedback is a bug report from a user, link it to the bug in backlog. The linking could be manual or automated (maybe keyword matching can suggest linking).

- **Analytics on Feedback:** Provide charts such as: top categories of complaints, trend of user sentiment over time, top requested features (which overlaps with idea votes, but this could catch things not formally submitted as ideas), and customer satisfaction scores. For example, an **NPS trend chart** if NPS data is fed in; or a **word cloud** of most common words in open-ended feedback (to spot keywords). If EPMT is integrated with usage analytics, maybe correlate usage with feedback (e.g., feature X used heavily but has many complaints -> indicate a usability issue). This might be advanced, but even basic frequency analysis of tags is useful.

- **Feedback Prioritization:** Some feedback might require immediate action (e.g., a major complaint or a suggestion from a VIP customer). The tool could allow marking a feedback item as urgent or high priority, which could automatically create a linked backlog item or raise an alert. Or at least a field to mark importance. The PM should be able to convert a feedback item directly to an idea or backlog item similar to how ideas get promoted – although if it's a generic feedback like “I don't like the new UI”, converting that to an actionable item might involve creating a story like “Improve UI based on feedback”. The tool could assist by storing the context (maybe attach the feedback thread to the story).

- **Two-way communication (if applicable):** For integrated feedback from support systems, if a PM updates a status or resolution in EPMT, optionally push that back to the support ticket. E.g., if a customer requested a feature via support and now it's implemented, EPMT could trigger a message to the support agent or directly to customer if appropriate (“The feature you asked for is now live!”). Similarly for bugs, once fixed, maybe notify relevant reporters. This might require integration hooks with support CRM.

- **User context linking:** If the feedback is from a known user, tie it to their account or organization (especially in B2B contexts). Then PM can see which customers have given most feedback or if a particular big client has many requests outstanding. E.g., link to CRM so that an idea can show “Requested by Customer X (revenue Y)”. That could inform prioritization (for enterprise, sometimes features for top-paying customers get priority). This is more advanced but maybe a note like “Customer: ACME Corp” on feedback if available.

**Key Features & Requirements (Bug Tracking):**

- **Bug Intake:** Similar to above, bugs can enter from various sources:

  - **QA Testing:** Testers using EPMT or integrated tools create bug records (with steps, severity, etc.). They might do this in JIRA or another bug tracker typically. EPMT should either allow logging a bug directly (like a backlog item marked as bug) or pull them from JIRA if that's the main dev workflow. Possibly both.
  - **Automated error logs:** Not for v1, but some orgs integrate error monitoring (Sentry, etc.) into bug tracking. We might not handle that directly aside from letting those create bug tickets that sync.
  - **Customer-Reported:** Some bugs come via user feedback or support (like a ticket that's actually a bug report). Those should be flagged and either become bug items in EPMT or are forwarded to dev tool.

- **Bug Tracking Integration:** Most likely scenario: Many enterprises use Jira for all issue tracking (features and bugs). If so, EPMT might rely on integrating rather than duplicating bug tracking. For example, EPMT could consume a filtered list of issues from JIRA that are labeled “bug” or belong to a QA project. It can then display summary stats: how many open bugs, etc. Possibly it can allow creating a JIRA bug from within EPMT (via API) if a PM needs to log one. So, integration features:

  - Connect to bug tracking tool API (JIRA, GitHub Issues, etc.).
  - Periodically sync bug items (maybe as part of backlog sync or separate).
  - Show details in EPMT or at least link to them.
  - If a bug is marked resolved in external system, update status in EPMT’s view.
  - Allow filtering by severity, component, etc., within EPMT for analysis.

- **Native Bug Management (if not integrated):** In case an organization doesn’t have a separate tool, EPMT should be capable of handling bug reports internally. That means having a Bug type in backlog (we do), fields like severity (Critical, Major, Minor), reproducibility, etc., and possibly a simpler form for non-technical users to log them (maybe the same idea portal could be used to submit bugs by customers, or an internal QA view). The workflow for bugs might differ slightly (triage by severity, etc., but essentially they are backlog items too). So EPMT should treat them similarly in backlog prioritization – they can be tagged and prioritized vs features. The difference is in analytics: we might want metrics such as bug counts and trends.

- **Bug Analytics:** Provide insight into bug metrics: e.g., number of open bugs over time (burn down of bug backlog), average time to resolve bugs, bug counts by severity or by module, etc. These help quality tracking. For example, after a release, see if bug count spiked (which might show a quality issue with that release). If integrated with an external tracker, perhaps EPMT can just fetch those stats. If tracking internally, generate charts in a dashboard. Possibly tie with release analytics (like “Release 5 had 20 bugs reported in first week”).

- **Linking Bugs to Releases:** Ensure that bugs can be associated with the release in which they were found or fixed. That way, release analytics can consider them (like a release quality metric). This could be as simple as tagging a bug with “found in v2.0” or in backlog linking bug to a release target (if it’s going to be fixed in that release). On the release page, one might see how many bugs were fixed as part of it.

- **Prioritizing Bugs vs Features:** The backlog prioritization should consider bug severity automatically to some extent. For instance, a Critical bug might by default be considered a high priority backlog item. Possibly allow separate queues but product planning often has to merge them (“should we fix this bug or build new feature first?”). EPMT’s prioritization tools (scorecards, MoSCoW, etc.) should be applicable to bugs too (maybe treat severity as an input to score). The PM and EM should be able to see all work (features + bugs) in one place to decide trade-offs.

- **Visibility & Alerts:** Key bugs (especially customer-found ones) should be visible to PMs who might not be in the dev tracking tool daily. EPMT should ensure that if, say, a P1 bug is filed, the PM gets alerted and can decide if it affects the roadmap (maybe delaying a feature to address bug). Conversely, if a bug fix is not going to happen soon, and customers are waiting, PM might add a note in external roadmap or to the support team. EPMT being a central spot helps those communications.

- **Integration Example:** If integrating with JIRA: EPMT might show a widget of JIRA queries, e.g., “Open bugs in project X by priority”. It could poll the JIRA API. A PM in EPMT sees “5 open critical, 10 major, 20 minor”. They can click to drill or open JIRA link. Possibly allow editing some fields if API allows (closing a bug or adding comment from EPMT).

**User Stories (Feedback & Bugs):**

- _As a Product Manager, I want to gather and review user feedback from multiple sources in one place, so that I can understand user needs and pain points without jumping between different tools._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ The system aggregates user feedback. For example, I see in EPMT a “Feedback Inbox” that shows entries like: _Jul 1: “The new dashboard is confusing” – via in-app feedback; Jul 1: “Feature X doesn’t work for me” – via Support Ticket #4567; Jun 30: NPS survey response (score 5, comment “Lacks reporting features”)._ Each entry shows source and content. I can click an entry to see more details if available (e.g., user email, any metadata). I should be able to filter by source or by keyword (search “dashboard” to see all mentions). After reviewing, I can mark an item as processed (or leave it). The key is I don’t have to separately log into the support system and survey tool and app telemetry; at least the relevant excerpts are visible here. Integration wise, maybe the support and survey tools pushed data here. This is satisfied if I can see at least two different source types of feedback listed together.

- _As a Product Manager, I want to correlate user feedback with specific features or ideas, so that I can quantify demand and make informed prioritization decisions._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ For a given idea or feature (say “Add Dark Mode”), I can view a related feedback section listing all feedback entries about it. For instance, on the idea page for Dark Mode, it might show “5 users have requested this or mentioned it: \[list of feedback IDs or quotes].” If currently not linked, the system can assist linking: maybe I can search feedback for “dark mode” and attach relevant ones. Alternatively, from a feedback item, I can attach it to an idea/feature. Once linked, the idea detail could show something like “Linked Feedback: 5 (total users impacted approx 200 if each feedback represents an account)”. Acceptance is fulfilled if I can take at least one feedback item and associate it to an existing idea or create a new idea from it, and later see those associations for context.

- _As a Support Agent, I want to escalate a customer’s feature request or bug report from our support ticket system into the product management system, so that the product team is aware of it and can prioritize it appropriately._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ In practice, this could mean within Zendesk or similar, the agent tags the ticket as “Feature Request” and it triggers an integration that creates an entry in EPMT’s Idea or Feedback module. But focusing on EPMT side: once integrated, that support ticket appears automatically in EPMT’s feedback list (with a tag linking back). The PM sees it, perhaps converts it to an idea or links to one. From EPMT, ideally, a feedback entry that came from support retains a link (like a URL to the Zendesk ticket, and maybe the customer name). If the PM changes status or comments in EPMT for that item, optionally it could sync a note back to the ticket (like “Product team is considering this for Q4” which agent can later share with customer). The acceptance: I as an agent know that when I mark a ticket appropriately, it does show up in PM’s queue (which I can confirm by some log or by asking PM). On EPMT side, it’s about capturing that info with context.

- _As a QA Engineer, I want to file a new bug and have it tracked in the product management tool so the product manager can prioritize it, but also reflected in our development bug tracker so developers address it, ensuring no bug falls through the cracks._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ Let’s say I discover a bug during testing. I use EPMT to log it (maybe through the backlog interface, add new item of type Bug, fill description, steps, severity). Once I save it, two things happen: (1) It appears in EPMT backlog bug list with status New. (2) If integrated with JIRA, it also creates a corresponding bug issue in JIRA (with fields mapped: title, description, severity, etc.). If developers primarily work in JIRA, they see it there immediately. The PM in EPMT sees it and decides if it needs to be escalated in priority. If the developer fixes it and marks the JIRA issue resolved, EPMT either auto-updates the bug item status to Resolved or when I check it, I get a prompt to mark resolved. In short, there is two-way sync. For acceptance, at least one direction should work: if I create in EPMT, it shows in dev tool, or vice versa. If no integration, then developers would check EPMT backlog for bugs; but likely integration is expected. So success example: I log bug in EPMT at 3pm, by 3:05 it’s visible in JIRA for developers with all info, and a JIRA ID is now linked to EPMT bug item.

- _As a Product Manager, I want to monitor the volume of user-reported issues and feedback after a release, so that I can gauge the release’s quality and user satisfaction._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ The system provides a view (possibly under Release Analytics or Feedback) that, for a given release, shows how many feedback entries or bug reports were received within, say, 2 weeks after release. For instance, release 5.0 went out June 1; by June 14, the dashboard shows “User feedback items: 30 (20 negative, 5 positive, 5 neutral), Reported bugs: 10 (2 critical, 5 major, 3 minor)”. This might be compiled from filtering the feedback DB for dates and linking bug records to release. Even if not automatic, I (PM) can filter feedback by date range and manually count sentiment, but better if automated. Another metric: perhaps an NPS or satisfaction score specifically for users who got the new version, if that can be measured (like difference in NPS before/after). The acceptance: in some form, I can assess if a release caused a spike in issues. If integrated with analytics, maybe user engagement too, but here focusing on feedback: I should see those bug counts easily (maybe on the release detail page an “Issues reported” count).

- _As a Developer or QA, I want to see all the known bugs for the feature I'm working on in one place, so that I can make sure to address them and see their status._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ If I’m working on Feature X, which had some bugs from previous version or in testing, I can go to either the feature’s page or a bug list filtered by feature. Possibly via linking: backlog feature item shows “linked bugs”. Or I filter bug list by tag “Feature X”. Then I see 3 open bugs related to it, their status, severity, who’s assigned. This helps me ensure I fix them as part of Feature X improvements. If integrated, that might require linking bugs to features either manually or via tags. Acceptable if at least PM can mark bug’s “affects feature = X”. Then dev can filter. Or simpler, dev uses JIRA normally for bug list. However, if dev is using EPMT UI, the filter and linking should exist. So, success if I can view either by feature or by release or by component all relevant bugs easily within EPMT.

**Workflow – Feedback and Bug Flow:**

- _User Feedback Flow:_ A customer uses the product and submits feedback via the integrated widget. This goes into EPMT’s feedback list as a new entry. The Customer Success team might also add a note on the customer’s account about this request. The PM in EPMT sees the new feedback entry (perhaps tagged “feedback”). They read it, determine it’s essentially a feature request or improvement suggestion. The PM links this feedback to an existing idea (or creates a new idea) in the Idea module. Now the idea’s vote count or supporting evidence is stronger. The PM might respond (if possible) to the user – if it’s through support, maybe ask support to reply. Over time, multiple users give similar feedback. The PM groups them all under that idea. This gives data in the idea like “15 users requested, total 15,000 users affected (if each user’s company has x users, etc.)”. When prioritizing, PM uses that info. Once the feature is implemented, the PM might compile a message to all who gave feedback via either an update in the idea portal or asking support to inform them. This closes the loop.

- _Support Ticket to Idea Flow:_ A support agent gets a ticket: “User cannot find how to do X – maybe the UI is unclear.” The agent realizes this is product feedback and tags it accordingly. EPMT’s integration sees that tag and automatically creates a feedback item with the ticket text and meta (user, etc.). The PM sees it in EPMT, and decides it indicates a need for better UX. The PM might convert it to a backlog story “Improve UI for doing X” right away, or link to an existing backlog if one exists. They mark the feedback as acknowledged. The support agent sees in their system that product team picked it up (if integration sends a note or if they have access to EPMT to check status). Later, that improvement is done in version Y, and the PM updates the ticket or tells support “tell user we fixed that.”

- _Bug Report Flow:_ During testing, QA finds a bug. If the organization uses JIRA, QA likely files it in JIRA. Because of integration, the PM and EM see it in EPMT too (maybe EPMT automatically pulls all issues with type Bug and status New). The PM prioritizes it relative to other work; if critical, they might add it to current sprint via backlog module. EPMT might highlight the new critical bug in the backlog view. The EM assigns it to a developer. The developer fixes it, marks JIRA done. EPMT sync shows bug as done. If the bug was reported by a customer as well, maybe link that feedback so PM can close the loop with customer when fixed. Alternatively, if no JIRA, QA logs bug in EPMT directly as backlog item. EM sees it, puts in sprint, dev fixes and marks done – all in EPMT.

- _Post-Release Monitoring:_ After releasing version 5.0, the PM uses EPMT to watch incoming feedback closely. They notice an uptick of feedback entries complaining about a new feature’s complexity. Also, support tickets related to that feature spiked. Meanwhile, internal error monitoring (though not directly integrated, QA manually logs a couple of crash bugs discovered via logs). EPMT aggregates at least the support ones and any in-app ones. The PM assembles this info and in EPMT can generate a quick report: maybe filters feedback by date and category, counts negative vs positive. They see 10 negatives specifically about the new feature. They then plan an improvement and log an idea or backlog for next version “Simplify Feature UI based on feedback”. Because all feedback was visible, they have concrete quotes to reference in the user story.

- _Analytics and Continuous Improvement:_ Over time, the product team can measure that “We have reduced the number of support tickets related to onboarding by 30% after implementing feature X”, because they can compare feedback stats from before and after. E.g., EPMT can show fewer feedback items tagged "confusion" or NPS improved. They feed this back into showcasing product success.

In summary, this module ensures that **the voice of the customer and quality issues are tightly integrated into the product management cycle**, rather than being siloed in support or QA tools. It gives the product team a holistic view of both what users want and what problems they are facing, enabling more informed decision-making.

**Integration Specifics:** The module likely involves integrating with external systems:

- _Feedback tools:_ E.g., if using Pendo or Heap for usage analytics and feedback, EPMT might integrate to get feature usage metrics. If using an NPS tool, maybe import scores. Possibly allow a CSV import if API not available. The requirement explicitly says “integrate with user feedback analytics tools” – those could be any that measure user behavior or feedback, such as Google Analytics (for usage data), Pendo (for in-app feedback and usage), Hotjar (for feedback polls), etc. Integration might be gradually added.
- _Bug tools:_ JIRA is a common one. Perhaps others like Azure DevOps, GitHub Issues, etc. Provide connectors to at least one (JIRA likely first). Possibly allow generic integration via Zapier or similar if not direct.
- The PRD should specify that connectors can be configured, and which data flows are expected (maybe use REST APIs and webhooks).
- Also, ensure **data privacy**: user feedback might contain personal data, so compliance with privacy (GDPR) is needed (e.g., allow deleting a user's feedback if requested, etc.).

---

## Product Release Analytics Module

**Description:** The Product Release Analytics module is focused on measuring and analyzing the **outcomes of product releases**. After a new version or feature is released to users, this module gathers data to answer: _How is the new release performing?_ _Are users adopting the new features?_ _Did the release improve key metrics like usage, retention, or revenue?_ _Were there issues (bugs, negative feedback) associated with the release?_ This gives the product team and stakeholders a clear picture of the release’s impact and success, closing the feedback loop and informing future decisions.

This module likely involves both **usage analytics** (quantitative data) and **business metrics**, possibly pulling from product analytics systems, as well as summarizing qualitative feedback and bug counts (overlap with previous module). It can be considered a lightweight product analytics dashboard integrated into the product management tool, tailored specifically to tracking release results and product KPIs.

**Key Features & Requirements:**

- **Release Definition:** In EPMT, releases should be first-class entities. A release may be defined by a version number or name (e.g., “v5.0” or “2025 Spring Update”) and have a release date (actual or planned). It could also list which features (backlog items) were included. The Release Analytics module is tied to these release objects. Each release record can store metadata like release date, type (major/minor/patch), and goals or hypotheses for that release (e.g., “increase conversion by 10%”).

- **Integration with Analytics Tools:** To get usage data, integrate with analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap, etc.). EPMT might not record every usage event itself, but it can retrieve key metrics from such systems via APIs. For instance:

  - _User Adoption:_ number of users who used new Feature A within the first week vs total users (adoption rate).
  - _Engagement:_ time spent in application before and after release, or how often a new feature is used (daily active users, feature-specific usage counts).
  - _Retention:_ did user retention improve after release? (This may need cohort analysis if possible).
  - _Conversion or revenue metrics:_ if applicable (e.g., upgrade rate increased by X after new feature).
    The specific metrics depend on product type, but ideally allow configuration of which metrics to track per release. Perhaps a setup where PM can define KPIs for a release (like “Metric = daily active users, goal +5%”). EPMT would then fetch those metrics regularly.

- **In-App Event Tracking (Optional):** If integration is not feasible, EPMT could offer its own event tracking snippet (like an SDK to instrument the product). That’s quite involved, likely relying on external tools is easier. But since “natively provide product release analytics” is mentioned, EPMT might include some built-in analytics collection. Maybe not building a full analytics platform but something like a small snippet to count usage of certain features (like call EPMT API when Feature A button is clicked). Possibly not first priority in v1, but keep in mind.

- **Release Dashboard:** For each release in EPMT, display a dashboard of key metrics and charts:

  - **Usage Adoption:** e.g., a chart of how many users have used each new feature introduced in that release (maybe over time).
  - **User Growth or Activity:** e.g., line chart of daily active users around the release date to see if there's a jump or drop.
  - **Performance Metrics:** if relevant, e.g., app load time, error rate, etc., before vs after (maybe integrated from monitoring tools).
  - **Goal Achievement:** if goals were set (like “increase conversion”), show pre vs post metrics. Possibly a simple table: Metric X (before: 10%, after: 13%, goal: 12%, result: achieved).
  - **User Feedback Summary:** pull from feedback module the count of feedbacks or sentiment specifically after this release (like discussed: number of complaints or praises referencing the new features).
  - **Bugs Summary:** how many bugs were reported after release and their severity distribution (this indicates quality).
  - **Upgrade/Adoption Rate:** if not all users are forced to the new version (like mobile apps where users upgrade gradually), track how many have updated to the new version. For enterprise SaaS, usually all get it at once, but mobile or on-prem products might have an adoption curve.
  - **Feature Flags / A/B tests:** If a release was rolled out gradually or as A/B test, show metrics for test vs control if integrated. That might be advanced though.

- **Comparison & Benchmarking:** Show the current release’s metrics compared to previous releases. For example, if average daily usage increased 5% in this release, how does that compare to last release’s effect? Or compare bug counts: did this release have fewer bugs than last major release? Possibly maintain a summary table of key metrics per release. This helps context (like “We usually see \~3% user increase per release, this one gave 6%, great success” or vice versa).

- **Custom Metrics Input:** Possibly allow manual entry of certain metrics if automated data isn’t available. For example, the PM might manually enter “Sales increased by \$50k after feature launch” or “Customer satisfaction score = 8.2”. This ensures even offline metrics can be recorded.

- **Alerts on KPIs:** If a metric falls below or above expectation, the system might flag it. For example, if error rate skyrockets after release, mark release analytics in red or send an alert (some of this overlaps with DevOps monitoring, but product PM might want to know if there’s a serious issue impacting users). Or if adoption of a new feature is very low, that’s an insight to flag.

- **Data Granularity and Privacy:** Only aggregate metrics should be shown to avoid any personal data issues. We’re interested in trends and totals, not individual user’s behavior (that belongs in analytics tool details, not in PRD). So compliance wise, ensure only anonymized, aggregated data flows in.

- **Integration with Release Process:** Possibly integrate with CI/CD or release management to know when a release went live. For example, if using a CI pipeline, once deployed, it triggers EPMT to start collecting metrics for “Release X” from that date. Or at least the PM marks the release as “Launched” on a certain date/time, which starts the “post-release” data window. Could be manual: a PM clicks “Mark as Released” and from then, the analytics is considered active.

- **Report Exporting:** The PM or management may want to compile a **Release Report**. Provide an export (PDF or PPT format perhaps) of the release analytics dashboard to share with executives or team. It should highlight what was delivered (maybe list key features) and the outcome metrics. Possibly allow adding commentary in the tool so the report can include narrative like “The increase in DAU suggests the new gamification features are well-received, however, the negative feedback on UI changes indicates some users struggled.”

- **Learning & Backlog Feed-in:** The results should feed back into backlog or ideas: e.g., if a metric is poor, maybe create a backlog item “Improve feature adoption for X” or an idea to address whatever shortfall. Or if something succeeded, note that for future expansions. This is more process than tool, but perhaps the tool can prompt: “Adoption of Feature Y is only 10% – consider an action (create idea to improve, schedule training, etc.)”.

**User Stories (Release Analytics):**

- _As a Product Manager, I want to track key usage and performance metrics immediately after releasing a new feature, so that I can measure whether the feature is achieving its intended purpose._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ Suppose we release Feature Z in version 3.2 on July 1. I have defined a metric for success: “At least 500 users use Feature Z in the first week.” The Release Analytics for v3.2 automatically (or after minimal setup) shows me how many users are using Feature Z each day of that week. For example, by July 8, it shows 600 users have tried it (with maybe a trend chart). That surpasses my target, which can be indicated (green check). If it were below 500, maybe a red mark or something. Additionally, I see overall product usage: it might show that daily active users before release was 5,000 and after release 5,300, a 6% increase. The acceptance is fulfilled if I can see at least one chart or number reflecting usage of the new feature and one reflecting an overall product metric change, tied to the timeframe of the release. The data should come either via integration (the product likely logs events like “Feature Z used”), or if not integrated, I have a way to input it. But since it says natively provide, likely integration behind the scenes but as far as I see, it's in the EPMT UI clearly.

- _As a CEO or executive, I want a high-level summary of what each product release delivered and how it impacted key business metrics, so that I can evaluate ROI and progress against objectives._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ For each release, say I have a table or list:

  - Release 3.2 (July 1, 2025): _Features:_ A, B, C; _Result:_ +5% active users, NPS +2 points, \$100k increase in monthly revenue, 2 critical bugs (fixed within 2 days).
  - Release 3.1 (Apr 1, 2025): ... etc.
    The executive can access an “Analytics Overview” that condenses each release’s outcomes. Alternatively, the executive uses the same release dashboard but filters to key metrics or an executive mode. The acceptance is that an exec (with maybe read-only access) can see, in a concise way, the impact of releases. Perhaps a PDF report of release 3.2 that includes all metrics and the ability to read commentary. EPMT might allow adding a summary note per release (PM writes “This release focused on improving user onboarding and succeeded in raising retention by 10%.”). If not directly in tool, at least the data is present so the PM can communicate it. But ideally, one could generate a one-pager: "Release X delivered Y value."

- _As a Product Manager, I want to be alerted if a new release causes a significant drop in a key metric (like user engagement or an increase in errors), so that I can quickly respond to any problems introduced._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ After release, EPMT monitors certain metrics. For example, user login rate or transaction success rate. If within 24 hours of release, the login success rate drops by more than, say, 5%, EPMT flags this. Perhaps it sends me an alert “Potential issue: Login success dropped to 90% after Release 3.2 (was 98%)”. Similarly if active user count significantly falls (which might mean users encountered a bug and stopped using). Or if a high number of bug reports are logged within a day of release. EPMT would aggregate such signals and produce an alert. The acceptance is satisfied if, for instance, as a PM I get a notification or see on the dashboard a warning when a metric threshold is crossed. The threshold might be predefined or learned from baseline. This ensures rapid reaction (like maybe roll back or patch the release).

- _As a Data Analyst (or PM), I want to experiment with A/B testing of a feature in a release and see the results (which variant performed better on certain metrics) within the product management tool, so that product decisions can be based on those results._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ This is a bit advanced – suppose the new release had Feature Z behind a feature flag with 50% users getting it (A/B test). If integrated with an experimentation platform or analytics, EPMT could show: Group A (with feature) vs Group B (without feature) and compare metrics like retention or conversion. For acceptance, maybe the tool can import results if an external tool is used (like if they use LaunchDarkly or Optimizely, maybe integrate to fetch the outcome). At minimum, allow me to enter the results: e.g., “Variant A: 10% conversion, Variant B: 8% conversion, statistically significant improvement with feature.” EPMT could then mark the experiment as successful, and perhaps prompt to roll out to 100%. If integration not present in v1, having a structured way to record experiment results in the Release Analytics (like an experiment entry under release with outcomes) would fulfill it. This story may be beyond initial scope, but it’s a powerful aspect of release analysis.

- _As a Product Manager, I want to maintain a historical record of release outcomes to inform future planning, so that we can learn from past successes or failures._
  _Acceptance Criteria:_ I can look back at Release 2.0 from a year ago and see what its goals were and what happened (maybe we saw minimal adoption of a feature and decided to deprecate it later). EPMT retains that data – maybe archived but accessible. I can also filter or query across releases: e.g., “Show me all releases where user engagement decreased” or “List the improvement in NPS after each release last year.” Acceptable if the tool doesn’t automatically do queries but at least stores each release’s metrics and I can manually check them. Ideally, the interface can compare two releases side by side. The key is longevity of data – ensure it's not just ephemeral dashboards.

**Workflow – Using Release Analytics:**

- _Setup Phase:_ Before a release goes out, the PM defines in EPMT the release entry (if not already created during planning). They attach the list of features (likely automatically if backlog items tagged with that release). They also configure metrics: e.g., via integration selection – perhaps they link EPMT to their Google Analytics property and specify events or metrics to track (like “event FeatureZ_used count” or “page view of NewDashboard page”). They set any goals or expected ranges for metrics. They mark which day/time is release (if known in advance).
- _Release Launch:_ The release is deployed. The PM (or CI) marks it as launched at exact time. This might trigger EPMT to begin collecting data. If integrated with something like Segment (a customer data platform), as events flow, EPMT picks relevant ones. Maybe an hourly or daily sync from analytics data to EPMT’s database.
- _Monitoring Period:_ Over the next days/weeks, EPMT populates the release’s dashboard. The PM checks it daily, especially in first few days. For example, Day 1 shows usage metrics starting to come in. They see that out of 1000 daily active users, 200 used the new feature (20% day1 adoption). Also, unfortunately, error logs show a spike – maybe captured via a monitoring integration or by increased bug reports. The PM sees “Critical bug count: 5 (compared to 0 normally)”. They investigate (likely in bug system) and coordinate a fix. Because EPMT alerted them quickly, they were proactive.
- _Post-release Review:_ After say 2 weeks or 1 month (depending on cycle), the PM compiles the results. EPMT’s dashboard shows final numbers: e.g., _Goal: 500 users use Feature Z in first week – Actual: 600 (120% of target)_, _Goal: Improve retention by 5% – Actual: 3% (not fully met)_, etc. The PM writes commentary in a notes field: “Feature Z usage exceeded expectation, but retention improvement was less than hoped, likely because onboarding can be improved. Also we had an outage on day 2 that affected metrics.” They mark the release analysis as reviewed. They might share the results with the team by exporting to PDF or presenting directly from EPMT in a meeting.
- _Learning Integration:_ The insights gained lead to adjustments: e.g., they create a new backlog item “Improve onboarding for Feature Z to drive retention” to address the shortfall. They also note that a particular approach used in this release worked well (like releasing gradually) and plan to repeat it. If the release was very successful, that might influence prioritizing similar features. If a feature had low adoption, they might decide not to invest further in that direction. All this is recorded or at least influenced by the analytic evidence in EPMT.
- _Historical use:_ A few releases later, someone asks “When did our NPS jump last year?” The PM can look at the release analytics and see that in Release 3.0, NPS went up significantly, which coincided with a major UX overhaul. That knowledge is preserved.
- If the company does quarterly business reviews, the PM can easily pull data from each release to show product progression over time (like “We grew DAU by 20% over the year, largely due to Q2 and Q4 releases, as shown in these charts.” EPMT basically provides the base charts).

Throughout, EPMT acts as a central repository for product outcomes, not just output (features delivered) but outcomes (impact on users and business). This fosters a **data-driven product management** approach, ensuring the team learns from real-world results rather than just moving on after shipping.

**Integration & Data:** To implement this, EPMT likely integrates with:

- Google Analytics or similar for usage metrics (via API to get usage of certain screens/events).
- Mixpanel/Amplitude for event-based metrics like feature usage and retention analysis.
- Possibly a data warehouse if the company consolidates metrics there (maybe allow connecting to a database or CSV).
- Crash/Performance monitoring (like New Relic or Sentry for errors).
- If the product is mobile, Google Play/App Store for adoption rates of app version, etc.
- It could also integrate with sales or financial systems if tracking revenue impact, but that might be out of scope for initial.
  Alternatively, EPMT could allow manual entry for any metric not automated, so at least all data is stored in one place.

Security-wise, any access to analytics data should be read-only and via secure API usage, possibly store minimal needed data (aggregates). Possibly caching some results in EPMT’s DB for fast display.

## Workflows and Use Case Scenarios

To summarize how all these modules interact, below are key end-to-end **workflow scenarios** that illustrate the interactions between modules and roles:

**1. Idea to Release Workflow:** This is the overarching lifecycle of a feature, combining steps from idea capture to execution and analysis:

| Step                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Idea Submission**           | A new idea is submitted via the Idea Portal (either by a customer or an internal stakeholder). For instance, a customer suggests a “Collaboration feature” through the portal. The idea appears in the system with status "New".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **2. Triage & Enrichment**       | The Product Manager reviews the idea, discusses it with the team via comments, and tags it under "Collaboration" category. They notice similar ideas, so they merge votes or mark duplicates as needed. The idea accumulates votes and gets a high score using the built-in scorecard (e.g., high impact, moderate effort).                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **3. Backlog Promotion**         | The Product Manager decides to pursue the idea. With one click, they promote the idea to the Backlog, creating a new feature item ("Implement Collaboration Module") in the backlog. The idea status auto-updates to "Planned". The new backlog item is linked to the idea and inherits its description and context.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **4. Backlog Prioritization**    | In backlog grooming, the team estimates the new feature (e.g., 20 story points) and the PM prioritizes it relative to other work. Using EPMT's prioritization tools, the PM sets it as "Must Have" for the next release and places it near the top of the backlog. The feature is large, so the PM also creates sub-items (user stories) under it.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **5. Roadmap Scheduling**        | The PM adds the feature to the Roadmap, scheduling it across Q3 and Q4 (it’s a big initiative). On the roadmap timeline, a bar "Collaboration Module" spans Aug–Oct with a milestone for "Beta release end of Oct". This roadmap item is associated with the backlog epic and the strategic goal "Improve team engagement". Stakeholders see it on the roadmap for Q4.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **6. Resource Allocation**       | For the upcoming Sprint, the Engineering Manager allocates developers to start this feature. They open the Resource view for the next 4 sprints. They assign the backend portions to Alice and front-end to Bob, making sure neither exceeds 80% capacity in each sprint. The tool suggests Alice (skill: backend, available) and Bob (skill: frontend) which matches the needs, and they are free, so assignment is done. The capacity chart shows both are within limits (Alice 75%, Bob 80%).                             |
| **7. Development & Integration** | Developers begin work. They use Jira integrated with EPMT: tasks appear in Jira with links back to EPMT. As they progress, they update statuses (In Progress -> Done). EPMT backlog auto-updates those statuses via integration, so the PM sees progress (e.g., 5 of 10 subtasks done). QA logs a couple of bugs in Jira; those appear in EPMT backlog tagged to this feature as well. The PM monitors both features and linked bug fixes in one place.                                                                      |
| **8. Release Preparation**       | The team finishes development. They mark the feature "Done" in backlog and it's included in the upcoming version 1.5 release. The PM uses EPMT to prepare release notes linking this feature to user-requested idea (which can later be communicated to voters). The Release entry "Version 1.5" is set with date and features list including this Collaboration Module.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **9. Launch & Communication**    | Version 1.5 is released to users. EPMT's Release Analytics starts tracking metrics for this release. The PM also changes the Idea status to "Released" and writes a public response on the idea portal: "This feature is now available in v1.5!". All users who voted get notified automatically about the update. Meanwhile, support tickets related to collaboration get tagged as resolved.                                                                                                                               |
| **10. Post-Release Analytics**   | Over the next month, the PM checks Release Analytics for v1.5. They see the Collaboration feature usage: by end of month, 60% of active teams tried it, and overall product engagement increased 15% (surpassing the goal of 10%). There were 3 minor bugs reported post-launch, which were quickly fixed in a patch. NPS score improved from 30 to 40 after release. All this is displayed in EPMT’s dashboard for v1.5. The PM generates a report from EPMT highlighting these successes for the next stakeholder meeting. |
| **11. Continuous Feedback**      | Users provide feedback on the new collaboration feature (some want additional functions). Those feedback items flow into EPMT and new ideas are opened or linked. The cycle continues with new iterations to enhance the feature in future releases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This end-to-end scenario demonstrates how the modules interconnect to take an idea all the way through implementation and validation in an efficient, traceable manner. Each transition (idea -> backlog, backlog -> roadmap scheduling, dev -> release -> feedback) is facilitated by the tool with minimal manual overhead, and communication flows to stakeholders and users throughout.

**2. Bug Fix Workflow (Integrating Support and Development):**

| Step                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. User Reports Bug via Support** | A user encounters a bug ("unable to save profile settings") and contacts support. The support agent logs a ticket in Zendesk and tags it as a “Bug”. Through integration, EPMT automatically creates a new bug entry in the Feedback/Bug module, linking to that ticket (ID #789).                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **2. QA Verification & Backlog**    | The QA team reproduces the bug and adds details. The Product Manager sees the bug in EPMT with severity “High” and immediately promotes it into the Backlog (if not already) as an item "Fix profile save error". It’s given a high priority. If using Jira, a corresponding Jira bug is also created (or linked) automatically.                                                                                                                        |
| **3. Assignment**                   | The Engineering Manager checks Resource Allocation for the current sprint. One developer (Charlie) has some spare capacity. They assign the bug to Charlie. Charlie is notified (via EPMT or Jira).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **4. Fix and Sync**                 | Charlie fixes the bug in code. In Jira he marks the issue resolved (or in EPMT, moves the bug to “Done”). EPMT syncs and the backlog bug item now shows status “Resolved”. The support ticket integration triggers an update in Zendesk, notifying the support agent (and optionally the user) that a fix is on the way (or in next release).                                                                                                           |
| **5. Release Patch**                | The team decides this bug warrants a hotfix release (v1.4.1). They create a Release entry for v1.4.1 in EPMT, link this bug as the content. After deploying the patch, the PM marks Release v1.4.1 launched and perhaps directly associates it with the support ticket (like marking it solved).                                                                                                                                                        |
| **6. Analytics and Closure**        | Release Analytics for v1.4.1 might just note "bug fix deployed." The important part is the feedback loop: the user’s bug is fixed. The support agent closes the ticket. In the EPMT Idea/Feedback module, that bug entry could be marked closed and tagged to release 1.4.1 (for history). The PM might also convert it to an idea if there's a broader improvement suggestion behind it (e.g., if multiple bugs indicated a need for a deeper change). |

This shows how **EPMT integrates support and dev workflows**: user issues flow in and out of the system, ensuring the product team addresses them and users are informed of resolutions, all tracked within one system.

**3. Roadmap Communication Workflow (External and Internal):**

| Step                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Internal Roadmap Planning** | The PM creates an internal roadmap with detailed timelines and internal code names for projects. It includes exact dates and technical milestones. This is used in engineering planning meetings. The PM gives different team leads access to their relevant lanes (e.g., mobile team sees the mobile roadmap lane).                                                                               |
| **2. Executive Review**          | For a quarterly exec update, the PM switches to a high-level view (maybe filters the roadmap to show only major initiatives and hides low-level tasks). They generate a PDF from EPMT that shows Q1, Q2 major deliverables and progress bars. In the meeting, they use that to discuss strategy alignment. The execs appreciate seeing each item tied to company OKRs (which were linked in EPMT). |
| **3. External Roadmap Sharing**  | The company wants to share a broad roadmap with key enterprise clients and the user community. The PM creates an External Roadmap view in EPMT: it automatically hides confidential projects (marked internal) and shows others in less date-specific terms (e.g., "Coming in H2 2025"). They generate a shareable link.                                                                           |
| **4. Customer Access**           | A specific big client asks about feature X timeline. The Customer Success manager opens the external roadmap link (or exports a slide) and shows "Feature X is planned for Q1 next year" based on that roadmap. The client is satisfied with this transparency. Because this external view is derived from the same source, the info is up-to-date, avoiding errors.                               |
| **5. Updates**                   | When plans change (say feature X is moved to Q2), the PM updates the internal roadmap in EPMT. The external roadmap link automatically reflects this (perhaps it now says "H1" or specifically Q2). The Customer Success team, who rely on that link, immediately have the latest info to relay to clients, ensuring consistent messaging.                                                         |
| **6. Team Awareness**            | Meanwhile, internally, developers can look at the roadmap to see upcoming work beyond the current sprint. A developer sees that after the current project, an exciting new project is slated for next quarter, which boosts morale and preparedness. If they have concerns or ideas, they can raise them early because the roadmap is visible.                                                     |

This scenario highlights how EPMT’s roadmapping fosters clear communication at all organization levels without maintaining separate documents for each audience – one source, multiple filtered outputs.

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Annual Planning**        | At the start of the year, the PM and Engineering Manager load all planned major initiatives into EPMT (roadmap/backlog). Using the Resource module, they allocate tentative resources to each (maybe at team level). They discover Q3 is extremely packed for the backend team – capacity 1000 hours vs 1500 hours of work planned.                                                                                            |
| **2. What-If Analysis**       | They try scenarios: if they postpone one major feature to Q4, capacity aligns better. They adjust the roadmap accordingly (drag feature bar to Q4) and see resource load leveling out. Alternatively, they note that a particular skill (e.g., machine learning expertise) is needed for two projects at same time and they have only one ML specialist.                                                                       |
| **3. Hiring Decision**        | They take this analysis to management: "Based on our plan in EPMT, we are short of 1 backend engineer in Q3. Either we cut scope or we hire a contractor/consultant." They present the data: a graph from EPMT showing team workload vs capacity by quarter (with Q3 in red). Management approves hiring one more engineer by mid-year.                                                                                        |
| **4. Onboarding & Adjusting** | By Q2, they hire a new backend engineer. The admin adds this user to EPMT with their capacity. Now the resource plan in Q3 shows sufficient capacity (the red warning is gone). The PM can even assign some tasks to the "New Hire (TBD)" placeholder until the person is named.                                                                                                                                               |
| **5. During Execution**       | In Q3, if unexpected tasks come, the EM uses EPMT to see who can take them. Maybe the new hire finishes something early – EPMT shows he's at 50% capacity mid-quarter – so they assign him extra tasks, balancing load. If someone leaves or is sick, EPMT immediately highlights the gap and helps reassign tasks among remaining team.                                                                                       |
| **6. Retrospective**          | At year-end, they review resource utilization reports from EPMT. It shows on average, team utilization was \~85%, which is healthy (not over 100% which would indicate overwork, and not too low which indicates underuse). They also see that the new hire contributed X points, validating the hire. They will use these insights for next year's planning to justify any additional hires or to optimize team distribution. |

This scenario shows how capacity planning in EPMT helps in strategic decisions like hiring and scheduling major projects, ensuring realistic plans aligned with team strength.

These workflows illustrate the system's usage in realistic contexts. **They emphasize enterprise needs:** traceability, cross-functional visibility, data-driven decisions, and alignment with business goals. Each module contributes to a smooth workflow and they collectively ensure that the product development process is **holistic and well-orchestrated**.

## System Architecture and Design

EPMT is an **enterprise-grade SaaS application**. Its architecture must ensure reliability, scalability, and security while integrating multiple modules and external services. Below is a high-level overview of the system architecture:

**Architectural Style:** EPMT will adopt a **modular, service-oriented architecture** (with potential to evolve into microservices as needed). Each major module (Ideas, Backlog, Roadmap, etc.) can be conceptually a separate service or component. However, to start, a modular monolith could be implemented for simplicity, as long as boundaries are clear. The system is multi-tenant (one instance serves multiple company clients, each company's data isolated). The architecture emphasizes API-driven integration, so all functionalities are exposed via secure APIs, which the web front-end and external integrations use.

**Main Components:**

- **Web Front-End:** A responsive web application (built with a modern framework like React or Angular). This is what end users (PMs, devs, customers) interact with. It communicates with the back-end via RESTful (or GraphQL) APIs. Key UI elements include interactive drag-and-drop (for roadmap and backlog), real-time updates (maybe via WebSockets for notifications or collaborative editing). It should be optimized for performance and ease of use with enterprise-scale data (e.g., thousands of backlog items). Possibly separate front-end applications or portals for external idea portal (to allow public access with limited scope).

- **Application Server / API Layer:** The back-end logic providing endpoints for all functionality. It can be structured as:

  - **Idea Management Service:** Handles idea submissions, voting, commenting, notifications to contributors.
  - **Product Planning Service:** Manages backlog items, prioritization logic, scoring algorithms, and linking with idea and roadmap.
  - **Roadmap Service:** Manages roadmap entities, timeline calculations, progress roll-ups. Could provide endpoints like `/roadmaps`, `/roadmapItems`.
  - **Resource Management Service:** Handles users/teams, capacity data, and assignment suggestions (potentially containing an algorithm for recommendations).
  - **Feedback & Integration Service:** Connects to external APIs (support, analytics, bug trackers). It might use webhooks or scheduled jobs to sync data. For example, a subcomponent to handle JIRA API calls, another for Zendesk, etc., encapsulated in this service.
  - **Analytics Service:** Collects and stores aggregated release metrics. Might ingest data from external analytics or store events (if EPMT does event capture).
  - **Notification/Email Service:** Common module to send emails or in-app notifications to users (for idea status changes, assignments, etc.). Possibly integrated with an email provider (like SendGrid) and with in-app notification via WebSocket or polling.
  - **Authorization/Authentication Service:** Manages login (including SSO integration via SAML/OAuth), user accounts, roles, and permissions enforcement across other services.
  - **File Storage Service:** For attachments (images, documents uploaded to ideas or backlog items). Likely uses cloud storage (e.g., Amazon S3 or Azure Blob). Ensures scanning for viruses on upload and access control on files.
  - **Audit Logging Service:** Central logging of user actions for compliance (writing to an append-only log store).

- **Database:** A scalable database system. Likely **Relational DB (SQL)** for core data (ideas, tasks, users, etc.) to support complex querying and ensure integrity (foreign keys linking ideas to tasks, etc.). Each tenant's data partitioned via a tenant ID column or separate schema. Possibly use **ElasticSearch** for full-text search needs (ideas search by text). For analytics metrics, a **time-series or analytics DB** might be used (or simply store aggregated numbers in SQL). If event-level data is stored (maybe minimal), could use NoSQL or a Big Data store, but likely rely on external analytics to avoid heavy event storage.

- **Integration Connectors:** These could be separate small services or part of the integration service:

  - e.g., **Jira Connector** (poll Jira for new issues or receive webhooks, map to EPMT objects),
  - **Zendesk Connector** (listen for tagged tickets via webhook API, create feedback in EPMT),
  - **Analytics Connector** (pull metrics from GA/Mixpanel via their APIs given credentials).
    For scalability, these might be asynchronous processes (like message queues or scheduled tasks) so that rate limits or delays in external API calls don’t stall user interactions.

- **Message Bus / Queue:** Use of a message queue (like RabbitMQ or AWS SQS) for asynchronous processing. For example, when a user submits an idea, a message could be queued to send out email notifications. Or when backlog is updated, a message triggers recalculation of roadmap progress or updates to analytics. Also, integration connectors might push events into a queue (e.g., a webhook from Jira arrives, is placed on queue, then processed to update backlog).

- **Real-time Communication:** Possibly use WebSockets or similar for live notifications (like a dev moves a story on a Kanban board and PM sees it move without refresh). Real-time collab might not be heavy, but notifications (e.g., new idea arrives, notify PM online) could use WebSocket or long polling.

- **Security Components:**

  - Use an API Gateway to unify all API endpoints, enforce authentication (JWT tokens or session tokens), rate limiting, and request logging.
  - Encryption: All network communication over TLS. Sensitive data in DB encrypted at rest (especially if any PII or credentials for integrations).
  - SSO integration: support SAML 2.0 and OAuth (like Google or Azure AD) such that enterprise users can login with corporate accounts.
  - Role checks: Implement in the API layer for each endpoint (e.g., only Admin can call user management APIs, only PM role can reorder backlog).
  - Multi-tenant security: ensure tenant separation (each API call, by auth context, is scoped to their tenant; queries filtered by tenant_id).
  - Audit logging: each service logs important changes (with user and tenant context) to an audit log that admins can review.

- **Scaling Considerations:**

  - The application server can be stateless, allowing horizontal scaling behind load balancers. If using microservices, each can scale as needed (e.g., if Roadmap calcs are heavy, scale that service separately).
  - The database might need read replicas for heavy read scenarios (like many users browsing roadmaps concurrently). Partitioning could be by tenant if needed (large enterprise might get isolated DB instance or separate cluster).
  - Use caching for frequent queries (like caching the computed backlog order or roadmap views, possibly with invalidation on updates) – e.g., use Redis for caching or session store if needed.
  - For full-text search on ideas and feedback, an ElasticSearch cluster can handle scale of thousands of documents and complex queries.
  - File storage (S3) scales well inherently.
  - The integration connectors should be robust against API outages (retry logic, etc.) and not block the main user flows.

- **Deployment:** The system will be deployed in the cloud (e.g., AWS/Azure). Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes or cloud container service) for portability and scaling. Multi-tenancy can either be: one instance handles multiple tenants separated logically, or separate instances per big enterprise if required (but likely one multi-tenant system for SaaS). Provide environments: dev/staging for internal use and testing integrations, production for live. Support CI/CD pipelines for frequent updates, with strategies for zero-downtime deploys (like rolling updates).

- **Data Pipeline for Analytics:** If EPMT collects usage events (optionally), it might have a pipeline: events from client -> maybe an ingest service -> store in a raw event store or directly aggregate. But likely better to rely on external analytics to avoid reinventing event pipelines. For aggregated metrics retrieval, scheduled jobs could query external services periodically and store results in EPMT DB for display.

- **Third-Party Libraries/Services:** Use proven libraries for things like scheduling (Quartz.NET or cron jobs for periodic sync), for charts maybe integrate charting libraries on front-end. Use library/SDK for each integration (like official JIRA API client if available). For AI suggestions (like automatically categorizing feedback), maybe integrate an NLP service in future (not core for now).

In summary, the architecture is a typical **3-tier web app** (client, server, DB) extended with modular components and integration points. It emphasizes separation of concerns: e.g., a distinct integration layer so that if one external integration is slow or down, it doesn’t crash the whole app (use async decoupling). It also ensures that as usage grows (more ideas, tasks, users), the system can scale horizontally and maintain responsiveness.

**Technology Stack (tentative):** This PRD isn't about picking tech, but to give context: E.g., use Java or C# or Node.js for server; PostgreSQL for DB (with JSON support for flexibility), Redis for cache, ElasticSearch for search, React for front-end, and Kubernetes on AWS for deployment. Ensure frameworks or tools that support multi-tenancy and high security (e.g., Spring Security for auth if Java, etc.).

**Data Model Brief:**

- Tables like `Tenants`, `Users` (with tenantID foreign key, role), `Ideas` (id, title, description, status, votes, createdBy, tenantID, etc.), `IdeaVotes` (to tally who voted if needed to prevent duplicate by same user), `BacklogItems` (id, title, type, status, priority_order, story_points, assignee, release_id, tenantID, etc.), `EpicLinks` (to link backlog items that are under an epic), `RoadmapItems` (id, name, start_date, end_date, goal_id, release_id, maybe just use backlog epics for this), `Releases` (id, version, date, description, tenantID), `Feedback` (id, content, source, user_info, linked_idea_id or backlog_id, sentiment, date), `Bugs` (could be in BacklogItems with type=bug or separate table and linked similarly), `Teams` (id, name, tenantID), `UserTeams` (if a user can belong to multiple teams), `Skills` (maybe a join of user to skills tags), `Capacity` (table or calculation: could store exceptions like user vacations: fields user, start_date, end_date, availability adjustment). `Metrics` (maybe store key metrics by release: release_id, metric_name, value, date_recorded).
- For audit logging, either a generic table capturing entity, action, user, timestamp, old vs new values optionally.
- The data model should allow linking items: e.g. Idea -> (if promoted) BacklogItem (maybe backlogItem has idea_id nullable). BacklogItem -> Release (backlog item has release_id or a join table if many-to-many, but likely each backlog item targets one release). BacklogItem -> Roadmap (maybe indirectly via release or epic). Bug -> BacklogItem or is a type of it. Feedback -> could link to either Idea or Backlog (depending on nature). Many feedback could link to one idea (one-to-many).
- Multi-tenancy: either each table has tenant_id, or separate schema per tenant. Likely simpler is tenant_id column and add it to composite primary key or all queries filter by it, plus an index for performance.

**Scalability & Performance Considerations:**

- At enterprise scale, one tenant could have hundreds of users, thousands of backlog items, tens of thousands of ideas (especially if open to customers). Ensure queries for backlog list or idea list use proper indexing (e.g., sorting by vote count might require an indexed computed field or a separate table storing vote count to avoid heavy aggregation each time). Pagination or lazy loading for very large lists.
- Use caching for heavy computations like roadmap progress or big analytics queries, updating cache when underlying data changes.
- For concurrency: multiple PMs might edit backlog simultaneously. Use optimistic locking or real-time syncing to handle conflicts (e.g., if two try to reorder backlog at once, define behavior or lock that section during operation).
- The tool should be tested for large data volumes: e.g., 1,000 backlog items with complex dependencies open on a board, should still be responsive (<2 seconds load ideally).

**Availability & Fault Tolerance:**

- Deploy across multiple availability zones (for AWS) to avoid single data center failure. Use managed DB that supports failover.
- Regular backups of database (daily snapshots, etc.).
- Implement a read-only mode fallback (if partial outage of integration or something, core data still accessible).
- Monitoring and logging: integrate with monitoring tools (like CloudWatch, NewRelic) to track performance and errors. Alert devops team on anomalies (e.g., high latency, integration failures).
- SLA: likely promise \~99.9% uptime to enterprise customers, so design for minimal downtime (e.g., rollouts without downtime, DB maintenance carefully planned).

**Security & Compliance (detailed as required):**

- All data segregated by tenant, tested to ensure no cross-tenant data leaks.
- Sensitive fields (passwords, API tokens for integration) hashed/encrypted.
- Support for audit logs and possibly data export for compliance (if a customer wants an export of all their data, provide a way).
- **GDPR**: ability to delete user personal data upon request (so if a user contributes ideas or feedback and later asks removal, either anonymize that entry or remove personal identifier while keeping the content maybe). Also provide data portability (export data).
- Provide fine-grained permission settings e.g., within a tenant, maybe create custom roles or at least ensure the default roles meet least privilege (some enterprises might want e.g. a view-only role for audit).
- Penetration testing and code security reviews to meet enterprise standards (XSS protection on front-end, use prepared statements/ORM to avoid SQL injection, etc.).

By adhering to these architecture and design principles, EPMT will be robust and scalable enough for large enterprise use, while remaining flexible to integrate with the myriad of tools an enterprise might already use. The architecture aligns with the need to handle various modules in one platform yet maintain clear separation and maintainability.

## Integration & API Requirements

Integration is a critical aspect of EPMT to embed it within enterprise toolchains. The product must seamlessly connect with other software commonly used by product and development teams. Here we outline required integration capabilities and the APIs provided by EPMT:

**1. External Tool Integrations:**

- **Issue/Bug Tracking Integration:** The system should integrate with popular development tools (Jira, Azure DevOps Boards, GitHub Issues). This involves:

  - _Syncing Items:_ Ability to push backlog items (especially bugs or user stories) from EPMT to the dev tool and vice versa. For example, when a backlog item is marked "Send to Jira", it creates a Jira issue with fields like summary, description, labels (maybe tagging it as coming from EPMT). Conversely, if an issue is created in Jira under a certain project or with a certain label (e.g., "ProductIdea"), EPMT can import it as a backlog item or link it to an existing item.
  - _Status Updates:_ If a developer updates status or comments in Jira, those changes reflect in EPMT (via polling or webhook). E.g., marking done in Jira sets item to done in EPMT backlog.
  - _References:_ EPMT item should store the external issue ID (like Jira key) for traceability. Possibly display a direct link to open the issue in Jira.
  - _Configuration:_ Provide UI for admins to set up integration (e.g., Jira URL, API token, project key mappings). Not all tenants will use it, so must be configurable per tenant.

- **Version Control/CI Integration (optional):** Not explicitly asked, but to fully integrate dev cycle: possibly link EPMT items to commits or pull requests (via issue IDs). For example, if a commit message includes "Fixes PROJ-123", and PROJ-123 corresponds to an EPMT backlog item, EPMT could display that commit link. This might be future scope, but mention as a possibility.

- **Customer Support Integration:** Connect with systems like Zendesk, Salesforce Service Cloud, Intercom:

  - When a ticket is labeled as feature request or bug, automatically create an Idea or Feedback entry in EPMT.
  - Possibly allow support agents to query roadmap status from within their tool (maybe via an API call). Alternatively, allow deep linking: an agent sees an idea ID and clicks to view it in EPMT (if they have access).
  - Sync statuses: if an idea gets implemented, perhaps EPMT can send back a notification or change a field in the CRM (like mark the original ticket solved with note "addressed in release X").

- **Analytics/Data Integration:** Connect to analytics platforms to fetch metrics for Release Analytics:

  - Google Analytics: via Google API, query metrics like active users, user counts for certain events or page views.
  - Mixpanel/Amplitude: via their APIs to get event counts or user cohort analyses.
  - Pendo: might provide feature usage analytics and even in-app feedback. If Pendo is used, EPMT could integrate to get which features are most used or to push announcements for roadmap changes to users (like Pendo guides, but that is tangential).
  - The integration should be secure: e.g., allow user to connect an OAuth for Google Analytics, selecting the property and metrics to track for each release or overall. Perhaps integration settings per tenant for analytics (like specify which events correspond to each feature).
  - Data import on schedule: e.g., EPMT nightly pulls yesterday's key metrics. Or real-time if possible.

- **Communication Integration:** Slack/MS Teams integration:

  - Notify channels on certain events: e.g., new idea submitted could post to a Slack channel "product-ideas" with a summary and link. Or when a roadmap is updated, notify "product-team" channel.
  - Possibly a Slack command integration: e.g., `/epmt roadmap` returns a snippet of upcoming features, or `/epmt idea 123 status` returns the status of that idea.
  - This increases adoption by meeting users where they are and providing quick info access.

- **Calendar Integration:** Possibly for roadmap (like export roadmap milestones to Outlook/Google Calendar). Could allow an .ics file generation for key dates (release dates, etc.), so stakeholders can subscribe to it.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Integrate with enterprise identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin):

  - Support SAML 2.0 and OAuth/OIDC for SSO login.
  - Support SCIM for user provisioning if possible, so that when a company adds a user in their directory group for EPMT, it auto-creates in EPMT with correct role (this is advanced, but important for enterprise user management).

- **API for Ideas Portal:** If some clients want to embed the idea submission in their own app/website, provide an API or widget for# Product Requirements Document: Enterprise Product Management Tool

## Introduction

Enterprise Product Management Tool (EPMT) is a SaaS platform designed to streamline the **end-to-end product development lifecycle** for software products. It enables product teams to collect new ideas and user feedback, analyze product performance, and execute plans to create and improve products. The goal is to provide **enterprise-grade capabilities** that specifically support software product creation and improvement, consolidating what might otherwise require multiple tools. This PRD outlines the comprehensive requirements for EPMT, covering functional modules, user roles, user stories, acceptance criteria, workflows, permission models, system architecture, integration points, scalability, and security standards.

**Key Capabilities Overview:** EPMT will provide the following core capabilities (aligned with industry definitions of product management software):

- **Idea Management:** A centralized portal for capturing, organizing, and prioritizing ideas for product enhancements and new features. Customers, team members, and stakeholders can submit ideas and vote or comment on them, while product managers can evaluate and promote the best ideas into the development pipeline.
- **Backlog Management & Prioritization:** Tools to maintain a structured development backlog of user stories, features, and bug fixes. Users can prioritize tasks based on value, effort, or custom criteria (e.g. using frameworks like RICE or MoSCoW) and organize them into epics or categories. This improves task organization and planning efficiency.
- **Product Roadmapping:** Visual roadmaps to track product development progress over time. The roadmap module will allow scheduling of features and releases on a timeline, aligning them with strategic goals and communicating plans to both internal teams and external stakeholders.
- **Resource Allocation & Capacity Planning:** Functionality to allocate tasks to team members based on their skills, availability, and capacity. This includes managing team workloads, forecasting capacity for upcoming work, and suggesting optimal resource assignments to ensure balanced work distribution.
- **User Feedback & Bug Tracking Integration:** Integration with tools and processes for user feedback and quality assurance. EPMT will either natively collect user feedback (e.g., in-app feedback, surveys) and bug reports or integrate with external platforms (like support ticketing systems and developer bug trackers) to pull these inputs into the product planning process.
- **Product Release Analytics:** Built-in analytics to evaluate the success of product releases. This includes tracking key metrics (usage, adoption, performance, user satisfaction) for each release to determine if product changes are delivering the expected value.
- **Enterprise-Grade Platform:** Robust support for enterprise needs across all modules. This means role-based access control, single sign-on (SSO) integration, data security and compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.), high scalability (to support large user bases and data volumes), and rich integration APIs to embed EPMT in the enterprise ecosystem.

The following sections detail each of these areas, including the functional requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria, organized by module and user role. Subsequent sections address overarching requirements like workflows that span modules, the system’s architecture, integration requirements, non-functional criteria, and security considerations. The document is structured as a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD) for clarity and will serve as a foundation for design and implementation.

## Product Overview

EPMT is envisioned as a **central hub for product management**, consolidating capabilities that are often spread across disparate tools (idea voting systems, project trackers, roadmapping apps, resource spreadsheets, analytics dashboards). By unifying these, EPMT ensures a single source of truth for product plans and progress, which is crucial in enterprise environments where multiple teams and stakeholders must stay aligned.

**Target Users and Use Cases:**

- _Product Managers (Primary users):_ They will use EPMT to gather ideas, plan releases, define requirements, prioritize backlogs, and measure outcomes. Their use case spans the entire product lifecycle: from capturing the voice of the customer (ideas/feedback) to planning (backlog/roadmap) to execution oversight (resource allocation) to learning (release analytics).
- _Engineering Managers/Team Leads:_ They interact with backlog and resource modules to allocate work, monitor team workload, and ensure deliverables align with the roadmap. They also review incoming bugs and technical debt items.
- _Developers:_ They primarily interact by receiving their tasks via the backlog (potentially through integration with dev tools) and might submit ideas or flag bugs. They may consult the roadmap for context and use EPMT to update task status or comment on requirements.
- _Designers/QA:_ Designers might submit ideas for improvements and need to see upcoming features to prepare designs. QA engineers log bugs and review their status. Both roles ensure their inputs (usability feedback, quality issues) are captured in the backlog/feedback modules.
- _Executives/Stakeholders:_ They need high-level visibility via roadmaps and analytics. EPMT will allow them to see how product initiatives tie to strategic goals and what value recent releases delivered, without exposing low-level task detail.
- _Customer Success/Support Teams:_ They will channel customer feedback and requests into EPMT (through the idea/feedback integrations) and use the roadmap to provide customers with updates on upcoming features or the status of reported issues.
- _Customers/External Users:_ Via the idea portal or an externally shared roadmap, customers can influence the product by submitting/voting on ideas and seeing an overview of planned features. Their role in the system is limited to those interfaces with appropriate permissions.

**Value Proposition:** For enterprise teams, EPMT provides **visibility, alignment, and data-driven decision support**. It ties customer insight directly to development work – for example, an idea with many customer votes can be traced through implementation and then evaluated with release usage data to close the feedback loop. This traceability is often missing when using separate tools. By having everything in one platform, product managers can more easily communicate “why we are doing X” (because Y customers requested it and it aligns with goal Z) and later demonstrate “what was the impact of X” (as shown by analytics).

**Scope and Out-of-Scope:**
In scope are all features and modules described in this document. Notably, EPMT is **purpose-built for managing software products** and related activities (hence features like code repository management or detailed agile sprint ceremonies like burndown charts may be limited, since integration with specialized dev tools covers those). However, basic agile support (sprints, Kanban board views, etc.) will be included to the extent they overlap with backlog management. Out-of-scope are general project management features not directly relevant to product development (e.g., invoicing, procurement) and features pertaining to hardware manufacturing or supply chain (EPMT focuses on software). Also, while EPMT will integrate with many tools, it is not meant to replace code version control systems, dedicated analytics platforms, or full IT service management suites – rather it will connect to them to gather necessary data.

Finally, any AI/ML features (like automated idea categorization or effort estimation) are beyond the initial scope and can be considered for future enhancements. The initial release focuses on core functionality as described, providing a solid foundation with robust enterprise support.

## Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of EPMT is to **accelerate product success** in enterprise environments by improving how teams manage and execute product work. The following objectives break down this goal:

- **Centralize Idea & Feedback Management:** Ensure all product input (ideas, requests, feedback, bug reports) resides in one searchable repository. This helps product managers systematically review and derive insights (e.g., top requested features, common pain points) without juggling spreadsheets or disparate feedback channels. Success means no valuable idea or critical bug is lost or forgotten, and contributors feel heard through status updates and responses.
- **Data-Driven Prioritization:** Provide frameworks and tools to evaluate ideas and backlog items with objective criteria (votes, scorecards, tags like “customer priority”). The objective is to move away from gut-feel or HIPPO (highest paid person’s opinion) prioritization to a transparent method where decisions are justified by data (customer demand, business value, effort estimates). This includes visual aids like charts or scoring matrices to compare items, enabling evidence-based discussions in planning meetings.
- **Streamline Planning & Tracking:** Simplify the creation of roadmaps and backlog plans and keep them in sync. EPMT should make it easy to turn a high-level roadmap into actionable backlog items and vice versa (roll up backlog status into roadmap progress). The objective is that planning artifacts (roadmaps, sprint plans) are always up-to-date with minimal manual effort, improving trust in those artifacts across the organization. Everyone sees what is planned and how work is progressing relative to the plan, reducing miscommunication.
- **Optimize Resource Utilization:** Align planned work with available team capacity to avoid over-commitment. By factoring in each team member’s availability and strengths when scheduling work, EPMT aims to increase throughput and avoid burnout. An objective here is to maintain, say, an \~80% utilization target for teams (allowing buffer for unplanned work) – the system should flag if plans exceed 100% capacity for a team or individual, prompting re-planning. Over time, this leads to more predictable delivery and identification of staffing needs early.
- **Enhance Cross-Tool and Cross-Team Integration:** EPMT should fit into the enterprise IT landscape, not exist in isolation. One objective is to minimize duplicate data entry and context-switching. For example, a product manager should not have to manually copy a user story into Jira – the integration should handle it. Similarly, developers shouldn’t have to log in to EPMT separately to update status if they prefer their dev tools – updates flow between systems. By integrating with Slack/Teams, EPMT can even bring key updates to where teams already communicate. The measure of success is a smooth flow of information: support tickets turn into backlog items, backlog items into dev tasks, dev completion into roadmap updates, all via integration hooks.
- **Deliver Actionable Insights:** Through the Release Analytics, EPMT should clearly show the impact of product changes. Each release should have measurable outcomes – the tool will highlight these (e.g., “Feature X increased conversion by 5%” or “Daily active users grew 10% after Release 2.0”). The objective is for product decisions to be continuously informed by real user data and for the product team to demonstrate value to the business with quantifiable results. This closes the loop from idea (customer asks for X) to outcome (X delivered Y benefit), creating a learning culture of continuous improvement.

Meeting these objectives will result in improved efficiency (team spends less time on coordination overhead, more on actual product work), greater alignment (everyone knows what’s happening and why), and better products (focused on what customers and the business truly need, verified by analytics). In essence, EPMT’s success is defined by making the product development process more **transparent, predictable, and responsive to feedback/data**.

## User Roles and Permission Model

EPMT will implement a robust **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system to manage permissions, recognizing the hierarchy and collaboration needs typical in enterprises. Below are the primary user roles and their intended permissions:

| **Role**                            | **Description & Responsibilities**                                                                                                                   | **Permissions**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Uses backlog and resource modules to assign work and ensure delivery.                          | – Read/write access to backlog items: can create technical tasks, re-prioritize within technical scope, and update status (especially for bug triage or technical debt).<br>– Manage **Resource Allocation** for their team: assign tasks to team members, set team member availability (e.g., mark someone out-of-office).<br>– View the roadmap to understand timelines (and possibly edit minor scheduling details if agreed with PM, though major roadmap changes are PM responsibility).<br>– Create and manage bug reports (if QA is under them) or respond to ones in the backlog.                  |
| **Developer**                       | Team member implementing features/bugs. Focused on their tasks and providing input as needed.                                                        | – Read access to backlog and roadmaps for context (sees what’s in the backlog, the acceptance criteria, and how it fits into the roadmap).<br>– Update status on items assigned to them (e.g., start progress, add a comment, mark done).<br>– Comment on ideas or backlog items (e.g., ask for clarification, provide estimates).<br>– May create items of type “Technical Task” or “Bug” in the backlog if they encounter something (with approval flow by PM/Lead).<br>– No access to global settings or to alter priorities beyond their items.                                                        |
| **Quality Assurance (QA) / Tester** | Ensures quality by testing and reporting bugs; verifies fixes.                                                                                       | – Create bug reports in EPMT (or via integration from test management tools).<br>– Edit and update those bug items (add steps to reproduce, mark severity).<br>– View backlog and roadmap to know what to test and when.<br>– Comment on backlog items from a testing perspective (e.g., “needs test case for edge scenario”).<br>– Not typically reordering backlog or editing roadmap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Designer/UX**                     | Contributes design ideas and needs to prepare designs for planned features.                                                                          | – Submit ideas (often UX improvements) and comment on existing ideas (especially those that are design-related).<br>– Read access to the backlog and roadmaps to see what features are upcoming (so they can start design work early).<br>– Attach design files or links to backlog items.<br>– Possibly mark certain ideas as “design reviewed” or similar (if that workflow is needed), but no broad edit rights.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Stakeholder/Viewer**              | (e.g., executives, sales, marketing, client stakeholders) – need visibility but not editing.                                                         | – Read-only access to selected information:<br> • **Roadmaps:** Can view the high-level roadmap of relevant product(s) (either an internal high-level view or a specific external view).<br> • **Ideas/Feedback:** Maybe view or submit ideas, depending on role (executives might want to submit/vote on ideas; clients might only see their submitted ideas and public roadmap).<br>– Cannot modify backlog or priority, but could be allowed to add comments or attach customer context to items. For example, a Sales person might comment on an idea with a specific customer’s use case.             |
| **Customer (External)**             | External users (customers, beta users) using the Ideas portal or external roadmap.                                                                   | – Submit new ideas through a simplified portal (with fields moderated by PM).<br>– Vote and comment on ideas (if portal allows login accounts or open voting).<br>– View a curated list of planned features on a **Public Roadmap** (no internal dates or details).<br>– No access to internal backlog or sensitive data. Their interactions are restricted to the external-facing components.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

**Permission Model Details:**

- **Object Ownership and Scope:** Roles like Product Manager or Engineering Manager can be scoped to specific products/projects. The system will allow an admin to assign, for example, _Alice_ as a Product Manager for _Product A_ and a Viewer for _Product B_. This means Alice can fully manage Product A’s data but only view Product B’s roadmap (useful in enterprises with multiple product lines). Under the hood, objects like ideas and backlog items will carry a “product” or “project” tag, and permissions will be evaluated based on that plus the role.
- **Cross-role Interactions:** Some actions overlap roles. For instance, Developers and QA can create bug items; these appear in the backlog for PM/EM to prioritize. The system will allow creation but perhaps require a PM/EM to mark it “accepted” or assign priority before it enters the official backlog (to avoid clutter). Similarly, Stakeholders might add comments on ideas which PMs should review. Permissions will enforce that while a Stakeholder can comment, they cannot change an idea’s status or backlog rank.
- **Admin Overrides:** Admins have universal access but typically won’t interfere with content. However, they can act as any role if needed (e.g., if a PM is out, an Admin could change a status in emergency). Their main use is maintenance and user management.
- **Audit and Visibility:** Every data entity will have visibility controlled by role and product. By default, all internal users (PM, EM, Dev, QA, etc.) within a product can see the ideas and backlog for that product (transparency is generally good). But editing rights vary as above. External users see only what is published to them.
- **Granular Permissions Configuration:** In enterprise settings, sometimes custom roles or permission tweaks are needed (e.g., a “Product Owner” vs “Product Manager” distinction or a “Portfolio Manager” overseeing multiple product roadmaps). EPMT will offer a default set (as tabled) but should allow configuration: perhaps an Admin can create a custom role that clones PM rights but read-only on financial data (if any), etc. At minimum, toggling whether external users can see vote counts or not, or whether Developers can create backlog items, etc., could be provided as tenant-level settings.

**Permission Use Cases & Acceptance Criteria:**

- _Idea Visibility:_ A customer submits an idea. Internally, all PMs and team members for that product should see it in the Ideas list. A PM changes its status to "Under Review" – the external submitter should either see that update if they check the portal or get a notification (if logged in). Another customer (not the submitter) can see the idea only if the portal is public or if it’s been made visible (some systems allow private ideas vs public). We will assume a public vote board where all external users of that product line can see and vote on each other’s ideas (with moderation).
- _Backlog Editing:_ A developer tries to drag a backlog item to a different priority position in the interface. If they are not a PM or EM, the UI should prevent it (perhaps drag disabled). If they attempt via API, the server will reject with permission error. However, they can change the status of an item from “In Progress” to “Done” if they are the assignee or a team member on that project.
- _Roadmap Access:_ An executive logs in to view the roadmap. They should by default see an **Executive View** (a filtered roadmap focusing on milestones and outcomes, not all granular tasks). This could be implemented as a special roadmap view curated by the PM. The executive (Stakeholder role) cannot accidentally edit it – the UI likely doesn’t even show drag handles or edit buttons for them. They can export or comment (maybe ask a question on a timeline item).
- _Resource Data Sensitivity:_ The resource planning info (like who is over capacity, someone’s time-off schedule) might be visible only to PMs and EMs, not to all developers (to avoid, say, conflict if it includes performance-related info). We might restrict the Resource module such that only certain roles can see the full team overview. Developers might only see their own workload or the tasks assigned to them. This detail should be decided with user input, but likely EM and PM have full resource view; others have limited.
- _Security & Admin:_ If SSO is integrated, an Admin might not manage passwords (as that’s external) but still manages roles in EPMT. Admin can also export all data for audit purposes (e.g., for a compliance audit, to show all changes or to backup data). Only Admin role can do full data exports or delete projects, etc., to prevent accidental loss by PMs.

The permission model will be thoroughly tested to ensure users can perform their jobs without encountering unjust denials, while also protecting data from unauthorized changes or leaks. This RBAC setup aligns with enterprise expectations of **least privilege** and **segregation of duties**, and will be documented so that each client can configure it to match their team structure.

## Idea Management Module

**Description:** The Idea Management module provides a systematic way to **capture and curate ideas and feature requests** from both external and internal sources. It acts as the front-end of the product development funnel, where raw inputs (customer suggestions, employee brainstorms, etc.) are collected in one place for evaluation. By leveraging this module, product teams can ensure a continuous influx of innovation and improvements, while maintaining order and focus by filtering out the most valuable ideas to implement.

**Features & Functional Requirements:**

- **Idea Submission Portal:** EPMT will include a user-friendly portal for idea submission. External users (customers, partners) and internal stakeholders can submit ideas through a web form. The form will capture essential information: Idea Title, Description, optional attachment (e.g., screenshot), and allow categorization (the submitter might choose a category like “Usability”, “New Feature”, or a specific product area from a dropdown). If the submitter is an authenticated user, their info is recorded; otherwise, submissions could be moderated if anonymous posting is allowed. On submission, the idea is stored with status “New” and visible in the idea list for that product.
- **Idea List and Basic Workflow:** All submitted ideas appear in an Idea list (think of it as a queue or forum). Key fields: Title, Description, Submitter, Submission Date, Vote Count, and Status. Status is a lifecycle stage like: _New_ -> _Under Review_ -> _Planned_ -> _In Progress_ -> _Completed_ -> _Rejected_. Product Managers can change an idea’s status as it moves through consideration. Status changes (especially to Planned or Completed) will trigger notifications to the submitter and voters to close the feedback loop.
- **Voting System:** Authenticated users (internal or external, depending on config) can upvote ideas. By upvoting, they indicate support or that they also want this idea. The system should tally votes per idea and display the count. Each user gets one vote per idea (and maybe a limited number of votes overall to force prioritization, a common gamification). Internal product team members might also be able to “vote” or mark importance, or they might have a separate weighting – but initially, one vote per person per idea. Optionally, allow downvotes or neutral votes if needed, but typically upvote-only is simpler. If internal users want to proxy vote on behalf of customers (e.g., sales rep adding 5 votes because 5 customers asked), the system could allow a **proxy vote** mechanism: a PM or support agent can increment the vote count with a note citing external sources.
- **Commenting and Discussion:** Each idea acts as a thread where users (submitters, other voters, team members) can comment. This allows clarification questions, elaboration of use cases, or the product team to communicate back (“We’re considering this for next quarter”, “Thanks for the suggestion, can you tell us more about X?”). Comments can mention users and have basic text formatting. The PM should have moderation controls: edit or delete inappropriate comments (to maintain a constructive environment, especially if portal is public).
- **Tagging and Categorization of Ideas:** The PM can organize ideas by adding tags or linking to categories. For example, tags like “UI”, “Integration”, or “Low Effort” could be applied. Or categories might mirror product components (e.g., “Reporting Module”, “Mobile App”). The system should allow filtering the idea list by category/tag to help PMs and stakeholders focus (e.g., show me all ideas related to “Analytics”). Grouping ideas by theme can reveal the areas customers are most interested in.
- **Search:** A search bar to query ideas by keywords in title or description. This is vital once there are many submissions, to avoid duplicates and to find existing ideas when someone has a new suggestion (“is there already an idea about adding SSO support?”). The search should be text-based (with perhaps basic NLP or partial word matching) and accessible to all users who can see the idea list.
- **Duplicate Detection & Merging:** If a new submission is very similar to an existing idea (e.g., same title or containing similar key phrases), the system can either warn the submitter (“Possible duplicate found: \[Idea X], consider voting on that instead”) or allow PMs to mark ideas as duplicates. When merging duplicates, one idea (the master) remains, and the other is closed with a status like “Merged with \[Master Idea]”. Votes from the duplicate could optionally be transferred to the master (to not lose the support count) – or the PM can manually adjust via proxy voting to combine counts. The UI should prevent the clutter of many duplicates by guiding users and giving PMs the tools to consolidate ideas.
- **Scoring & Evaluation Tools:** Beyond votes, internal PMs might score ideas on various dimensions (as referenced earlier, frameworks like RICE – Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort). The Idea module should allow an internal-only scoring field or form. For example, a PM can input: Reach = 1000 users, Impact = High, Confidence = High, Effort = M (medium) which computes a RICE score that helps compare ideas. This data would be private to the product team (not visible to voters). The system could rank ideas by such a score or at least present it in a PM-only view. This ties into prioritization when deciding which ideas to promote to the backlog.
- **Promotion to Backlog (Idea-to-Feature):** This is a critical function: once an idea is decided to be implemented, the PM can promote it to the development backlog with one action. This could be implemented via a button like “Create Feature” or “Promote to Backlog”. Upon clicking, the system will create a new backlog item (in the backlog module) with the idea’s title/description, and ideally link the two (so the backlog item references its originating idea). The idea’s status automatically changes to “Planned” (or “In Progress” once development starts). Any further discussion might move to the backlog item, but the idea thread can still be used to update voters. The idea entry might then show something like “✅ Planned for Release 5.0” to communicate outcome.
- **Automatic Status Updates:** To manage voter expectations, EPMT can automate certain updates: e.g., when an idea that was promoted to backlog and then that backlog item is marked done in a release, the idea’s status flips to “Completed” and a notification/email is sent to all voters saying “Idea X has been delivered in Release Y – thank you for your input!”. Similarly, if a PM marks an idea “Rejected” (maybe with a reason comment), voters get a courteous notification (“Idea X was not taken up: \[PM’s reason].”). This transparency is key to maintaining engagement in the feedback community.
- **Private vs Public Ideas:** Enterprises may have internal ideas separate from customer-submitted ones. EPMT could support marking an idea as internal-only. This way, employees can suggest things (or note technical improvement ideas) that are not exposed on a public portal. The permission model would then show internal ideas only to internal roles. Possibly maintain two parallel portals if needed (one customer-facing, one employee-facing) feeding into one combined list with visibility flags. For v1, a simpler approach: one portal but a toggle on each idea for “Visible to customers” vs “Internal”. The PM can control that.
- **Reporting and Insights on Ideas:** Provide analytics such as: number of new ideas per month, number of ideas by status, top contributors (who submitted most ideas or which ideas have the most votes), etc. For example, a PM can see “500 ideas submitted this quarter, 50 planned, 20 completed, 10 rejected, rest under review.” Or “Top 5 ideas by votes.” This helps in product ops and showing that the team is actively processing the input (e.g., converting X% of ideas into features).
- **Idea Portal Customization:** Enterprises will want the portal branded and tailored. Allow basic customization: company logo, color theme, maybe a welcome text or instructions for idea submitters. Also, the ability to configure categories or input fields (maybe add a field like “Which product edition does this idea relate to?” or “How badly do you need this (Nice-to-have or Must-have)”). This makes the portal feel integrated with the company’s identity.
- **Spam Prevention and Moderation:** If portal is public, introduce measures like CAPTCHA on submission, rate limiting (to avoid someone scripting 1000 ideas), and moderation queues for first-time external users. The PM or a community manager should have the ability to remove spam or off-topic ideas. If an idea is removed, decide if voters see it or it just disappears (maybe better to show “Removed by moderator” to avoid confusion).
- **Integration with CRM for Ideas:** (Optional early on, but mentioned in requirements as integration with feedback systems) If ideas can be tied to customer accounts (for B2B products), it’s useful to link an idea with which customer(s) want it. E.g., via Salesforce integration or a manual field “Customer Impact: ACME Corp, BetaCo”. This helps PMs weigh priority by customer revenue or strategic value. EPMT could allow tagging an idea with a customer name (select from a list of accounts). This might be fed from the CRM integration or manually input by support when forwarding requests. Not a core requirement but aligns with enterprise usage where “which big clients asked for this?” is a common question.

**User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (Idea Management):**

- _As a customer (external user), I want to submit a feature request through a simple portal, so that I can suggest improvements for the product I use._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** The customer can access the Ideas portal (public URL or in-app widget), fill in a form with at least a title and description, and submit. Upon submission, they receive a confirmation (on-screen and/or email if provided). The new idea is saved in the system with status "New". The idea should be visible on the portal’s list (unless moderated). If the same customer tries to submit a duplicate idea, the system should alert them of the existing one by title match (e.g., “Similar idea exists: \[title]”). The submission form is user-friendly and works on mobile browsers as well.
- _As a product manager, I want to review new ideas and filter them by category or votes, so that I can focus on the ideas that align with our strategy or have high customer interest._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** In the internal interface, the PM can view a list of ideas with sorting and filtering controls. They can sort by newest, by most votes, or filter by category/tag (e.g., only show ideas tagged "Reporting"). The PM can click on an idea to see full details and all comments. The interface should allow multi-select or quick actions (like “Mark several ideas as Under Review” or apply a tag to multiple). Filtering by status is also needed (to see which ideas are still New and need attention). The system returns results quickly even if hundreds of ideas exist.
- _As a product manager, I want to change the status of an idea (e.g., to Planned or Rejected) and provide a reason, so that stakeholders are informed about its disposition._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** The PM can open an idea, select a new status from a dropdown (Planned, Completed, Rejected, etc.), and add an optional comment (for context, especially on Rejected like “not in line with product vision” or on Planned like “targeting Q4 release”). On saving, the idea’s status is updated in the list with a color indicator or label. The system automatically notifies subscribers (e.g., via email: “Your idea 'X' status changed to Rejected – reason: Out of scope at this time”). External users should see the updated status if they view the idea on the portal (and possibly the PM’s reason if marked public). The acceptance is met if, after the PM update, an external user can refresh the idea page and see status = Rejected and the reason message, and if any configured notification was indeed sent.
- _As a product manager, I want to merge duplicate ideas and retain a single record for tracking, so that vote counts and discussions are consolidated._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** Suppose Idea A and Idea B are duplicates. The PM can mark Idea B as duplicate of A (via a UI action like “Merge into Idea A”). After doing so, Idea B gets a status like “Duplicate” or is removed from the active list, and perhaps a comment “Merged with Idea A”. All votes from Idea B are added to Idea A’s count (or at least not lost; maybe the system prompts: transfer votes? yes/no). Comments from Idea B could either be moved under Idea A (with a tag indicating they came from B), or Idea B’s page remains read-only with a link to A for full discussion. The acceptance: Idea A now shows combined vote count and maybe a note “includes votes from \[Idea B]”, and Idea B is no longer independently votable or visible in main idea list to others. If a user visits Idea B’s old link, it should redirect to Idea A or clearly state it’s merged and link to A.
- _As a stakeholder (internal or external), I want to upvote an idea that matters to me, so that I can support it without duplicating the suggestion._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** Given an idea listing or detail page, a user with appropriate access sees an “Upvote” button (or thumbs-up icon). Clicking it increases the vote count by 1 and associates that vote with the user (to prevent multiple votes). The button then changes state (e.g., highlighted or becomes “Voted” to indicate their vote is recorded). If they click again (to remove vote), system either allows toggling or not (depending on design, likely allow undoing a vote). A user cannot vote more than once on the same idea. If they try, the UI should not increment again, and the API should reject duplicate voting attempts (with idempotent results). If a user not logged in tries, system either prompts login or shows disabled. The vote count displayed is updated in real-time. This must work at scale (e.g., if 1000 users vote in short succession, the count should handle it correctly and the system remain performant, perhaps via asynchronous counting but eventual consistency).
- _As a product manager, I want to promote a highly-voted idea to the development backlog easily, so that I can initiate implementation without copy-pasting information._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** On the idea detail view, the PM has an option “Promote to Backlog” (visible since they have the PM role). When clicked, they might be asked to select a target project/backlog (if multiple), then confirm. The system then creates a new backlog item that includes the idea’s title (which can be edited during creation if needed) and description. It also links back to the idea. After promotion, the idea’s status automatically changes to “Planned” (and possibly a link to the backlog item or a label “In Backlog as \[PROJECT-123]”). The backlog item now appears in the development backlog list (with perhaps a marker that it came from an idea and a quick link to see original idea context). Acceptance: After using the function, the PM can navigate to the backlog module and find a new item with the idea’s content. Also, the idea in the idea list now shows a status or icon indicating it’s been moved forward (so stakeholders realize it’s being worked on).
- _As a product manager, I want to notify voters when their idea is implemented, so that they feel their input was valued and see the outcome._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** When an idea’s status is set to Completed (especially via linking to a release or backlog completion), the system sends an email to each user who voted or commented (who has not unsubscribed). The email subject might be “Good news! Your idea ‘X’ has been implemented” and body “We have released this feature in version Y. Thank you for your suggestion!” possibly with a link to release notes or details. If the user had opted out of notifications, they should not get it (there should be a per-user setting for receiving idea update emails). Also, on the idea portal, the idea could be listed under a “Completed Ideas” filter or archive, showing it delivered. This fosters a positive feedback loop. We consider this accepted if, after marking an idea Completed, at least the submitter receives a notification (others ideally too), and the idea shows as Completed with maybe the release identifier visible (e.g., a tag “Released in v5.0”).
- _As an administrator or PM, I want to configure the idea portal (branding and categorization), so that it matches our product taxonomy and style._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** Through an admin settings interface, the user can upload a logo, choose a color theme (or provide CSS), and manage the list of categories for ideas. For example, add “Mobile App” as a new category. Once saved, the submission form on the portal immediately reflects that category. Similarly, the portal’s header now shows the uploaded logo and uses chosen colors for headers/buttons. The changes persist and apply to all portal pages. The acceptance is that configuration changes are correctly applied without requiring code changes and that at least basic branding elements are covered.

**Non-Functional Considerations (Idea Management):**

- The idea portal will be accessed by potentially thousands of users (for a large customer base). It must handle concurrent submissions and voting with good performance. The UI should remain responsive and the backend should queue or batch heavy operations (e.g., recalculating top ideas).
- Security: external inputs should be sanitized to prevent XSS in idea descriptions or comments. Also, abuse prevention: there should be a mechanism (manual or automatic) to handle malicious content or overly rude comments (could be as simple as a “Report” button for users to flag, notifying PMs or admins).
- Privacy: If customers are posting, ensure no sensitive personal data is inadvertently exposed. Possibly allow anonymous posting if customers want (though then feedback loop is harder). Also comply with any need to delete an idea if a user requests (GDPR “right to be forgotten”) – e.g., remove their personal data or name from it, which is easier if we identify submissions by account.
- Scalability: The voting system should scale - possibly using an efficient way to store votes (like a separate table of userId->ideaId, and a cached count on idea row). The search should use an indexed search (possibly integrate something like Elasticsearch if needed for large volumes).
- The design should encourage engagement: e.g., show trending ideas, maybe send weekly digests of new top ideas to PMs or allow users to subscribe to certain categories of ideas. These are nice-to-haves that can increase usage of the tool, making it more valuable.

By implementing the above, the Idea Management module will enable a vibrant **ideation community** around the product, where valuable insights are systematically captured and acted upon. It directly supports the requirement to _“Provide idea management functionality for collecting, organizing, and evaluating ideas”_ as stated, with features to centralize feedback, encourage collaboration (via votes/comments), and connect ideas to actionable development work.

## Backlog & Prioritization Module

**Description:** The Backlog & Prioritization module is the engine room of EPMT where ideas are transformed into actionable work items, organized, and continuously refined. It serves as the interface for planning and managing the development tasks (features, enhancements, bugs) that have been approved for implementation. In an agile context, this corresponds to the product backlog and sprint backlogs, but it is flexible enough to accommodate different methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, or hybrid approaches). The module's focus is on helping teams **prioritize what to do next** and **maintain a clear, structured list of work**.

**Features & Functional Requirements:**

- **Backlog Item Types:** Within the backlog, users can create items of various types, primarily:

  - _User Story / Feature:_ A new functionality to be added. Usually tied to an idea or product requirement.
  - _Bug:_ A defect to be fixed (might come from the feedback/bug integration).
  - _Task/Chore:_ Technical tasks, refactoring, or other work that isn't directly a feature (could be things like "Upgrade library X").
  - _Epic:_ A large body of work that can be broken down into stories. Epics often come from big ideas and appear on the roadmap; they group multiple backlog items.
    Each item will have properties like a Title, Description, Type, Status, Priority, Points/Estimate, Assignee, etc. The system should allow filtering or color-coding by type so one can, for example, view all Bugs easily.

- **Hierarchy & Epics:** Support a hierarchy where backlog items (stories, bugs, tasks) can be grouped under Epics (or under high-level features). For example, an Epic "Revamp Onboarding Flow" might contain 5 user stories. In the UI, this could be represented as an expandable tree in the backlog list or a tag linking items to their epic. Progress of an epic should be trackable (e.g., 3/5 stories done). Users should be able to create an Epic item and then assign existing items to it or create new items under it directly. This addresses organizing by themes and is crucial for linking with roadmaps (epics typically map to roadmap items).

- **Backlog Views and Organization:** Provide multiple ways to view and organize the backlog:

  - _List View:_ A list of all backlog items, sortable and filterable. Perhaps grouped by default by status or priority.
  - _Board View (Kanban):_ Columns for status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Items can be moved between columns by drag-and-drop to update status. This board should be configurable (like if a team has custom workflow, e.g., “Code Review” column).
  - _Group by Epic or Sprint:_ Option to group backlog items by their epic or by sprint/iteration (if using time-bound sprints). For example, show a swimlane for each sprint with items in it. This helps in sprint planning to drag items into the next sprint lane. If no strict sprints, an "Unscheduled" vs "Scheduled (by release or milestone)" grouping might be used.
  - _Filter by Attributes:_ Quick filters for type (only bugs), for assignee (what’s Alice working on), for tag (items tagged "Performance"), or by source (items that came from external ideas vs internal tasks).

- **Prioritization Mechanisms:**

  - _Manual Ordering:_ The product owner/PM can manually order the backlog by drag-and-drop. This sets a rank for each item (often called backlog rank). The UI should make it easy to reorder even a large list, e.g., drag item to top or input a rank number. This manual ordering is often the primary way to denote priority (position 1 is highest priority). Everyone should see the backlog sorted by this rank by default (unless they apply filters/sorts).
  - _Custom Priority Fields:_ In addition to ordering, allow setting fields like "Priority" (High/Medium/Low or Must/Should/Could/Won't as per MoSCoW). Or maintain a score (maybe pulled from idea score or recomputed with RICE at story level). This gives a more qualitative label that can be used in filters ("show me all High priority items").
  - _Batch Prioritization Tools:_ Possibly provide a “Prioritization view” where multiple items can be seen in a matrix (like Value vs Effort) or in a scoring table for comparison. For instance, a page where the PM can adjust parameters for each item (value, effort, reach) and see an automatically sorted list by some algorithm (like a RICE or weighted shortest job first). Tools like Productboard have such features, and EPMT might include a simplified version to guide PMs. This is a nice-to-have to complement manual ranking, especially for initial backlog grooming after many ideas have been promoted.

- **Estimation and Effort Tracking:**

  - Each backlog item can have an estimate (in story points, hours, or a t-shirt size). The system should allow inputting that. For bugs, maybe have a severity instead or in addition (which can factor into priority).
  - If using story points and sprints, we might allow setting a sprint velocity and then warn if a sprint is over capacity (this touches Resource module too). For backlog management, at least display sum of points in a sprint or release to help gauge scope.
  - Items can also have due dates or target release fields (populated if scheduled for a specific release). This ties backlog to timeline.

- **Status Workflow:**

  - Default statuses: _To Do / Backlog_, _In Progress_, _Done_ (completed). Possibly _Blocked_ or _In Review_ can be added, configurable per team. The key is items move through these statuses during execution.
  - Changing status should be easy (via drag on board or dropdown in list). It should also trigger related actions: e.g., if an item is Done and it was linked to an idea, update idea status (via idea module logic). If an item is Done and tied to a roadmap epic, update epic progress.
  - If using Sprints, a status might also be _Deferred_ or _Removed from Sprint_ if not finished – but those can be handled by simply not marking done and moving back to backlog or next sprint.

- **Assignments:**

  - Each backlog item can be assigned to a person (or multiple if pair work, but typically one owner at a time). The UI shows the assignee (with avatar or name). Changing assignment (say PM or EM reassigns a task) should notify that person.
  - Unassigned items remain in backlog until someone (often EM in sprint planning) assigns them to a developer in a specific sprint or Kanban WIP.
  - Integration: if integrated with dev tools, assignment might sync (e.g., if a Jira issue is assigned to Bob, EPMT backlog reflects Bob as assignee).

- **Sprinting and Timeboxing (if applicable):**

  - The module should allow grouping items into iterations or sprints. For example, define Sprint 10 (with start/end date) and then assign items to it (drag into that sprint or set “Sprint” field on item). The system then can have a Sprint Board or list showing items in that sprint and their status.
  - Burn-down chart or burn-up could be generated for a sprint if we have daily progress (maybe tie into analytics or a simple chart from points remaining each day, but not strictly required for initial release).
  - Alternatively, if the team is Kanban (continuous flow), the concept of sprint is optional. We can allow backlog to be one continuous list and maybe mark a subset as "In Progress" without fixed sprint boundaries.
  - The backlog should also support planning future sprints (e.g., a backlog item might have a field “Planned Sprint” or “Release”). In enterprise, often planning is done a few sprints ahead at high level. Those items should still be in backlog but maybe tagged as “Planned for Sprint X” which then can be filtered.

- **Integration with Roadmap & Releases:**

  - Backlog items should have a field for “Target Release” (if the organization works with fixed release versions). For example, an item can be marked “Release 5.0”. Then the Roadmap module (which tracks releases and features) can automatically pull the list of items tagged for that release and summarize status.
  - If an item is tied to a roadmap epic or goal, that link should be recorded (maybe via the epic relationship or a direct field “Linked Goal: Increase retention”).
  - When all backlog items under a roadmap epic are done, the roadmap item can be marked done (with a prompt possibly).
  - The backlog view might allow filtering “by release” or “by roadmap epic” to support review meetings (like “show everything planned for Q4 release”).

- **Integration with Developer Tools:**

  - If using Jira, Azure Boards, etc., two-way sync should be handled as per Integration section. Specifically, changes in one should reflect in the other. E.g., if a developer closes a Jira issue, EPMT backlog item status goes to Done. If PM reprioritizes backlog in EPMT, it might update a priority field in Jira or at least order in an equivalent backlog there.
  - If integration is tight, some teams might continue using Jira for daily work and EPMT purely for higher-level management. The design should accommodate that by not requiring every developer to log into EPMT if they prefer their existing tool; EPMT should still get the data via integration so the PM sees a unified picture.

- **Bulk Operations and Shortcuts:**

  - Provide ways to edit multiple items at once, e.g., select 5 items and assign them all to Sprint 5, or mark 10 old items as “Rejected” if they are no longer relevant.
  - Keyboard shortcuts or quick add: e.g., when in backlog list, pressing “n” could open “new item” input to quickly add a backlog item on the fly (like during a meeting).

- **Notifications:**

  - If a backlog item is assigned to a developer, they should get a notification (email or in-app).
  - If an item they’re assigned is changed significantly (like description updated, or removed from sprint), perhaps notify to avoid confusion.
  - If a PM wants to remind or ping someone on an item, commenting with @mention should trigger a notification to that user.

- **Audit Trail:** Possibly record changes on backlog items (who changed status from X to Y at what time, who changed priority). This helps in big teams to trace decisions, and is also useful for compliance. Not necessarily exposed in UI except maybe a “history” tab on an item detail for PMs/admins.

- **Performance and Scalability:**

  - The backlog can grow large. Over years, maybe thousands of items (including done ones). The tool should allow archiving or hiding completed items from the active view (e.g., all done items older than 3 months are hidden by default, requiring a filter to see archive). This keeps the active list manageable.
  - Views should load quickly (<2 seconds ideally) for up to a few hundred items. Beyond that, use pagination or virtual scrolling. If someone filters to “All” including hundreds of done items, can be slower but still should handle it.

- **Prioritization Framework Support:**

  - We mentioned RICE in ideas. Some teams might want to use a formal framework at backlog level too (especially if ideas were rough and backlog items are refined). Possibly provide a Prioritization Matrix feature: e.g., an interactive chart where x-axis is effort (points) and y-axis is value (maybe from a custom field or derived from votes/score), showing each backlog item as a bubble. PM can quickly see which items are "low effort, high value" (quick wins) – those might be automatically recommended at top. This is an advanced feature; at minimum, one can export data to CSV for analysis externally if needed. But including a simple built-in analysis tool could differentiate EPMT (like how some tools have an “Impact vs Effort” chart).

- **Linking Backlog Items to Ideas & Feedback:**

  - If a backlog item originated from an idea (via promotion), it should show that link (e.g., “Origin: Idea #123: \[Title]”). The PM can click to see original context or comments from users.
  - If multiple ideas were merged into this one item, perhaps list them or note “requested by 5 customers via ideas” with a link.
  - If a backlog item addresses a specific bug or ticket from support, similar linking (maybe "Ticket 456 from Customer A attached").
  - These references ensure context is not lost and can be useful when writing release notes or if stakeholders ask “why are we doing this item?” – the PM can recall the source (X customers asked for it).

**User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (Backlog & Prioritization):**

- _As a product manager, I want to organize backlog items in order of priority, so that the development team clearly knows which tasks are most important to do next._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** In the backlog list, I can drag an item from position 5 to position 1. The list reorders, and that new order is saved. All team members now see that item at the top of the backlog. The item’s priority indicator (if any) might update (if we number them or mark top 5 as High, etc.). No two items share the same rank; the system might store an internal rank value to maintain ordering. If I refresh the page or another PM opens the backlog, the order remains as I set. I can also move items in a bulk way (maybe send to top or bottom quickly via a context menu). The test is that after reordering a few items, a developer viewing their board sees tasks aligned in that sequence (assuming no other sorting applied).
- _As a developer, I want to view the backlog as a Kanban board, so that I can easily see the status of tasks and pick up the next available work item._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** There is a board view showing columns (Backlog/To Do, In Progress, Done – or the team’s customized columns). All backlog items are represented as cards under their current status column. Initially, new items go to Backlog column. When I start work, I drag my card from Backlog to In Progress. This updates the item’s status to In Progress (and triggers any associated events like notifying PM or marking start date). When I finish, I drag to Done. The card then might disappear from the default view if Done is set to hide or might remain with a done marker (depending on board settings). The board respects permissions: e.g., if a stakeholder view is on, they might see the board read-only, or with some columns hidden. The acceptance is that moving cards changes status in the system, and the list view or integrated dev tool would reflect that change too. Also, if an item is blocked, we might allow tagging it or moving to a “Blocked” column if configured; ensure that can be done. Board should handle WIP limits if set (maybe for Kanban a team might say no more than 3 in progress per person; if an attempt to drag beyond limit, maybe a warning appears). (WIP limit is an extra, not mandatory for v1 but considered).
- _As an engineering manager, I want to plan which backlog items go into the next sprint, so that the team has a clear sprint backlog and we don’t exceed our capacity._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** Suppose we have Sprint 5 (2-week iteration) with capacity 40 points. In the backlog module, I switch to a Sprint Planning view. I see Sprint 5, Sprint 6 as slots. I drag user stories from the product backlog into Sprint 5. As I do, a counter updates (e.g., “Total points in Sprint 5: 38/40”). If I drag one more story of 5 points, it might highlight red (“43/40 Over capacity”) to warn me. I decide to leave that one in backlog or move it to Sprint 6. Once done, Sprint 5 has, say, 8 items assigned. The system sets their Sprint field to “Sprint 5” and likely their status to a specific planned status (or still Backlog until sprint start). On the start date of Sprint 5, perhaps an automatic action moves those items to “To Do” status in the Kanban (if we integrate with the concept of active sprint). But at minimum, we have a way to see which items are in Sprint 5. During the sprint, developers filter to Sprint 5 to focus on those. The acceptance is that the EM/PM can allocate items to a timebox easily, and get feedback if it’s too many (points or count), and that these assignments persist and can be adjusted (if we swap an item out mid-sprint, we change its Sprint field, etc.). If no formal sprint, the same mechanism might be used for “Release content planning” – e.g., assign items to Release 1.2 in a similar manner.
- _As a QA engineer, I want to add a bug into the backlog with details, so that it gets prioritized alongside other work._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** There is a way to create a new backlog item. I click “New Item” (maybe a global plus or in backlog module). I choose Type = Bug (maybe from a dropdown of types). I fill Title “Crash when saving profile”, Description with steps, Severity = High, and hit Save. The bug appears in the backlog list, typically flagged (maybe an icon or red color because severity High). By default, it's unassigned and goes to the bottom of the backlog or into a separate “Bug backlog” section depending on view. The PM is notified of a new bug item (especially since High severity). The bug can now be prioritized like any story (drag it up if urgent). The acceptance is that the backlog module allows entry of new items of any type, not just via idea promotion. All necessary fields for a bug can be captured (if more fields like environment, version are needed, either we have custom fields or a notes section where QA can put them). If integrated with an external bug tracker, possibly this could also push to that system, but that's integration detail.
- _As a product manager, I want to filter the backlog to only show me items planned for the upcoming release, so that I can review if our release scope meets the objectives._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** Assuming backlog items have a “Release” field or are associated with a release via epics, etc. In the backlog UI, I have a filter control. I select “Release = 1.0” (maybe from a dropdown of releases). The backlog list updates to show only items tagged for Release 1.0. Alternatively, if using sprints to correlate to release, I filter by Sprint (e.g., Sprint 5 and 6 which we know compose Release 1.0). The filtered view shows, for example, 15 items. I can quickly see their status (maybe 3 are done, rest in progress or to do). I cross-check if these cover the feature set promised. If needed, I adjust (maybe I see a low priority item sneaked into release tag, I remove its release assignment to push it out). The acceptance is satisfied if the filter reliably shows only items with that attribute, and I can combine filters (maybe filter “Release 1.0” and “Type = Story” to exclude bugs for a moment). The UI should clearly indicate filter active and allow clearing it. The underlying data should maintain these relationships so the filter is accurate.
- _As a developer, I want to receive a notification when a new task is assigned to me or an existing one’s priority changes significantly, so that I stay informed of changes in my work queue._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** If a PM/EM edits a backlog item and sets Assignee = Bob (and Bob is a developer), then Bob should receive a notification (depending on preferences, an email or an in-app alert). It might say “You have been assigned a new item: \[Title]”. If Bob was already assigned, but the PM drags that item from rank 20 to rank 1 (major priority boost), ideally Bob is notified that item is now top priority (this might not be an explicit feature, but the PM could manually send a note, or if item has due date now sooner, maybe then notify). Simpler acceptance: assignment triggers notify. Also, if the PM adds a comment mentioning Bob on any item, Bob gets notified. The notifications should have a link to the item and relevant info (due date if any, etc.). They should not spam too much (maybe batch if a lot at once). This ensures developers are aware when, say, in sprint planning the EM assigns them 5 items – they get 5 notifications or one summary (“5 new items assigned to you in Sprint 5”). Marking done or status changes might also notify PMs (e.g., PM can opt to be notified when high priority item is marked done). This can be configured, but acceptance here is at least assignment triggers a message and it's delivered to the right person in a timely manner.
- _As an executive stakeholder, I want to see only high-level features (epics) and their status, not the detailed backlog items, so that I can track progress without getting lost in technical detail._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** In the backlog or an associated view, there's a toggle or separate view for “Epics/High-Level”. When activated, the UI either shows only items marked as Epics (and possibly a roll-up of their progress) or it could show a summary of backlog by epic. For example, display each Epic as a row with maybe a progress bar or count of sub-items done. Stakeholders with view-only access might by default see this summary instead of the raw backlog. They might not even be given access to the granular view. Alternatively, they use the Roadmap module for high-level tracking instead of backlog. But if backlog is their interface, it should have an abstraction layer. The acceptance: a stakeholder can log in and quickly find, say, “Project X Phase 1 (Epic) – 10 stories, 8 done, on track for release” and not have to wade through 10 story tickets themselves. This might be achieved by guiding stakeholders to the Roadmap module for that info. Regardless, backlog module should support summarizing or filtering by epic or tag to serve that need.

**Non-Functional Considerations (Backlog & Prioritization):**

- **Consistency and Real-time:** Multiple product managers or team leads might collaborate in backlog grooming. If one reorders or edits items, others’ views should update (maybe via WebSocket updates or at least reflect on refresh). Conflicting edits (two people editing same item) should be handled gracefully (last save wins, with possibly a warning if an item was changed since you opened it).
- **Scale:** The backlog might be huge in long-term projects. The system should allow archiving old items (especially completed ones) to keep active backlog lean. Possibly automatically archive items that are Done and were released 6+ months ago (with an option to view archive). This ensures performance remains good. The search and filters should handle large datasets with indexing.
- **Integration Reliability:** Sync with external tools (if enabled) must be robust. If Jira is down, the backlog should still be accessible (maybe queue updates to send later). There should be a way to mark items as "external sync off" if needed or resolve conflicts (like if someone deletes an item in Jira that still existed in EPMT, EPMT might need to mark it removed). Logging of integration actions is important for troubleshooting.
- **User Experience:** The backlog is used daily by PMs and devs, so it must be snappy and not cumbersome. Common tasks (adding item, changing status, reordering) should be as few clicks as possible. Drag-and-drop should be smooth (with visual cues for valid drop zones). On mobile devices, the backlog might mostly be read-only (hard to drag on mobile), but at least viewing and maybe quick status updates could work. Ensuring the layout is responsive or a simplified mobile view might be considered.
- **Customization:** Some organizations have custom fields for backlog items (e.g., “Customer Impact” or “Regulatory Requirement ID”). The system should allow adding a limited number of custom fields to backlog items (text or dropdown). Or at least provide a generic “Labels/Tags” field to store arbitrary metadata.
- **Audit & Compliance:** In regulated industries, tracking changes to requirements is key. So backlog items might need versioning (if description changes, they want to see history) and a freeze/approve mechanism (some enterprises formally approve requirements before implementation). While not in initial scope explicitly, the design should consider if a "baseline" of backlog can be taken or if items can be marked approved. Possibly a simple approach: have a field "Approved = yes/no" and only let certain roles set yes. Then, a query of backlog could show all approved requirements for auditing. This might tie into custom workflow states (like Proposed -> Approved -> In Development). We mention this as it could be needed for some enterprise scenarios.

The Backlog & Prioritization module directly addresses the requirement to _“enable users to prioritize and maintain a development backlog to improve task organization and planning.”_ By supporting manual and data-driven prioritization, structured backlog management, and integration with development workflows, it ensures that the team always knows what’s on the plate and in what order, thereby aligning daily execution with strategic priorities.

## Product Roadmapping Module

**Description:** The Product Roadmapping module allows the creation of **visual roadmaps** that communicate the plan for product evolution over a defined timeline. It provides a macro view of how features, enhancements, and projects will be delivered over time, aligned with business goals. Roadmaps serve as a crucial tool in enterprise settings to set expectations with stakeholders, synchronize cross-functional teams, and track progress against strategic objectives. This module will enable product managers to map backlog items and epics onto a calendar, illustrating when and how key deliverables will happen.

**Features & Functional Requirements:**

- **Timeline Views:** The roadmap module will present a timeline (horizontal time axis) with units adjustable (months, quarters, years). Users can scroll or zoom this timeline. Along the vertical axis, it can list **Swimlanes** which might represent different products, teams, strategic themes, or any category of grouping (configurable by the user). For example, a company with multiple products might have one lane per product; a single product roadmap might use lanes for different initiatives or work streams.

- **Roadmap Items (Bars/Milestones):** The primary elements on the roadmap are:

  - _Bars_ representing a time span during which work on a feature/epic or initiative is happening. Each bar has a start date and end date. It typically represents an Epic or a group of backlog items (like “Feature X Development” from Jan 5 to Feb 20).
  - _Milestones_ representing significant dates (with no duration). E.g., a release date, an external event (conference), or a deadline. These could be depicted as icons or diamonds on the timeline.

  Each roadmap item (bar or milestone) will have a Name (e.g., Feature name or milestone description). Bars can also have additional info like a % complete or status color.

- **Association with Backlog/Projects:** Roadmap items should be linked to actual work in the backlog. For instance, a roadmap bar "Feature X" might correspond to Epic “Feature X” in the backlog which has 10 stories. The system should allow creating a roadmap item directly from an epic or linking an existing epic to a new roadmap bar. This way, progress on the epic (like stories done) can update the roadmap bar’s completion. Users could also manually create high-level items on the roadmap not in backlog (like "Usability Improvements Phase" as a bucket). But ideally, most are tied to backlog items or releases for traceability.

- **Multiple Roadmap Versions/Views:** The module should allow different views for different audiences:

  - _Internal Detailed Roadmap:_ Contains all planned work, possibly including internal code refactors or technical items. May show exact dates or sprints.
  - _Executive Roadmap:_ High-level, focusing on big ticket items and outcomes per quarter. Less detail, possibly grouped by strategic objectives.
  - _External/Customer Roadmap:_ Simplified to only show customer-facing features and broad timeframes (e.g., using "Q1 2025" rather than exact dates). It might hide or anonymize project names (e.g., instead of "Project Phoenix", say "Major Performance Improvements").

  The system might handle this via filters/tags (mark items as Internal only, or External OK) and timeline scale adjustments. Or by supporting multiple roadmap documents that can share data (like one can create an external view that auto-excludes items marked internal). For v1, a simpler solution: maintain one master roadmap and allow marking certain items as "Hide from external". Then an external export would omit those and generalize dates (like show only quarter or half-year). The UI for external viewers would then present the sanitized data.

- **Drag-and-Drop Scheduling:** Users (with edit permission) can create and schedule items by dragging on the timeline:

  - To create a new roadmap bar, they could click on a start date on the timeline and drag to an end date, then name the item in a popup.
  - To adjust timing, drag the bar left/right (changes start/end accordingly), or grab edges to extend/shorten duration.
  - Milestones can be created by clicking on a date (or via a form).
  - The tool should enforce or warn if there are conflicts or unrealistic overlaps (though often multiple features can overlap if different teams handle them, so the tool should allow overlaps on different lanes easily; overlaps on the same lane may or may not be allowed based on if that lane represents a single team’s capacity).

- **Dependency Mapping:** If one roadmap item depends on another (e.g., Feature B cannot start until Feature A is finished), the tool could allow linking them with an arrow (like a Gantt dependency line). If Feature A shifts, maybe warn that Feature B might need to shift. This is more Gantt-chart like behavior; for simplicity, we might not implement automatic cascading changes (that gets into project management territory), but at least allow a visual indication of dependencies. Possibly show an icon if an item starts before its prerequisite is done.

- **Progress Tracking:** Each roadmap bar can display progress:

  - If linked to an epic or release, it can auto-calc % done (e.g., 8 of 10 stories done = 80%). Show a small progress bar within the bar, or color-fill proportionally.
  - Alternatively, manually update progress or status (like PM marks “On Track”, “At Risk”). A color coding scheme: green for on track, yellow for risk, red for delayed.
  - Roadmap should highlight items that are completed (maybe with a check mark or different style) versus those in progress or not started. A completed item means its end date is past and work done, or PM manually closed it.

- **Annotations & Goal Linking:** It should be possible to annotate roadmap items with additional info like:

  - Strategic goal or OKR it supports (maybe via a label or icon).
  - Key metric target (like “Goal: +5% conversion”).
    This could tie into the analytics module which after release will check if achieved. But for roadmap, it's mostly for communicating why we are doing something.
    If the system has a separate Goals module or OKR management, linking a roadmap item to a Goal could be beneficial (then one could filter the roadmap by goal to see all features contributing to "Improve Reliability").

- **Release Representation:** If the organization does time-bound releases, the roadmap should mark release dates. This could be a special milestone or a bar labeled "Release 1.0 (Release Date)". Features planned in that release could either be grouped (like all bars culminating in that milestone) or drawn within a spanning bar representing the release timeline (like maybe an “Iteration” lane for each release).
  For simpler implementation: treat releases as milestones (with date) and allow associating features to a release (via tagging backlog items as such). On the roadmap, perhaps visually align those features to end by that release milestone.

- **Customization & Formatting:** Roadmap should be presentable. The user may want to adjust colors of bars (maybe each lane or each project gets a color), add a legend, or hide certain details (like hide percent complete if sharing externally). At least provide a clean print or export view (PDF/image export) so PMs can include the roadmap in slides or documents without heavy editing.

- **Collaboration:** Multiple PMs might edit the roadmap (especially if it spans multiple products). There should be edit conflict handling; perhaps lock an item while one is dragging it or disallow simultaneous edits on the exact same item. Or have an explicit “edit mode” and then “publish/save” to avoid partial changes in view for others. Ideally, changes reflect quickly for all viewers (or at least a refresh shows it). Activity feed could log "User X moved Feature Y from Q1 to Q2".

- **Roadmap Filtering:** Ability to filter which items are visible:

  - by status (maybe hide done items to focus on future),
  - by category (only show items tagged “Platform” if someone only cares about platform work),
  - by team or product (if multiple lanes, maybe filter lanes).
    Possibly an interactive legend where each lane or category can be toggled on/off.

- **Now/Next/Later (Optional view):** Some product roadmaps prefer a bucket approach (no specific dates, just group into Now, Next, Later). The tool could support a view where instead of timeline, we have three columns for Now (in progress), Next (planned next), Later (future ideas) and allow dragging items between those. This is a simpler alternative sometimes used for external roadmaps to avoid date commitments. EPMT could offer this as an alternative roadmap format (especially for external sharing). Even if not separate, the timeline view could be translated to this format for external consumption (e.g., anything planned in next 3 months = Now, next 6 months = Next, beyond = Later).

- **Integration with Calendar/Communication:** Possibly an export to calendar (like a Release milestone can be exported to Outlook as an event). Or integration with Slack (“roadmap changed: Feature X moved out by 1 month” posts in a channel).

- **Integration with Idea Portal (Communication):** If an idea is marked Planned and linked to a roadmap item, perhaps the public portal could show a high-level roadmap snippet or at least “Planned for Q4 2025” on that idea, which comes from the roadmap schedule. This ties together user expectations: if they suggested something, they can see when it's roughly slated.

- **Data behind Roadmap:** The system should store roadmap items with fields: name, description, start_date, end_date (for bars), type (bar or milestone), status (planned, done, etc.), lane (which lane it's on), link to epic/goal if any, and visibility flags (internal/external). The timeline calculations use these dates. It should gracefully handle uncertain dates (if an item has no fixed end date, maybe show it as “ongoing” bar to date like TBD; or allow quarter-based planning without exact day).

**User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (Roadmapping):**

- _As a product manager, I want to create a roadmap that shows the timeline for major features for the next 4 quarters, so that I can communicate the product plan to executives and other teams._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** In the Roadmap module, I create a new roadmap (or use default). I add lanes for each strategic initiative (or product component). For each major feature or project, I create a bar: e.g., I click in Q1 2024 under "Initiative A" lane, drag to end of Q2 2024. A dialog or inline edit appears for naming it; I name it "Feature X". I mark its type as Feature/Epic, link it to Epic #123 from the backlog. The bar now appears spanning Jan–June 2024 with "Feature X". I also add a milestone in end of June 2024 labeled "Release 5.0". I visually align "Feature X" to end by that milestone. I repeat for other features across Q3, Q4, labeling them accordingly. Once done, I switch to a Quarterly view (the timeline compresses to quarter units) to see balance: I see 3 bars in Q1–Q2, and 2 bars in Q3, 1 in Q4 for now. The roadmap can be printed or exported to PDF, which shows a nice chart with those bars and milestone labeled. The acceptance is satisfied if I was able to create those items easily, arrange them by drag, and the timeline reflects correct start/end, with quarter demarcations, etc. Additionally, when I linked to an Epic, if I go to that Epic in backlog and set some stories as done, the roadmap item "Feature X" might show 50% complete fill (if implemented). But core acceptance here is creation and basic display.
- _As an engineering manager, I want to see the roadmap for my product to understand upcoming deadlines and ensure my team’s work is aligned, so that I can adjust resourcing or scope if needed._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** The EM (who likely has view/edit on roadmap too) opens the roadmap. They can filter to just their product’s lane if multiple products exist. They see that a critical Feature Y is scheduled to be completed by end of Q1. They realize their team has some risk on that. They click on "Feature Y" bar and can update a status field to "At Risk" (maybe change its color to yellow). They could also extend its end date by dragging it into mid-Q2 to reflect a slip (though they’d likely consult PM first; assuming they have permission to propose a change). The roadmap now either shows the bar extended or maybe a tentative mark (depending on how we handle changes/proposals). Alternatively, they just note it and will discuss with PM. The acceptance: the EM can clearly read the timeline and identify what deliverables are expected when, and any change they make (if allowed) is captured (like dragging to extend date indeed moves that item appropriately). If they don't have edit rights, they at least have a view that’s up to date. Perhaps they have a toggle to show today’s date line to see how close deadlines are. If the EM wants, they can add a milestone "Code Freeze" 2 weeks before release, to remind the team. The system allows adding that milestone at the right date.
- _As a sales or customer success representative, I want to share a high-level roadmap with a customer to show what’s coming in the next 6 months, without committing to exact dates, so that the customer stays excited and informed._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** An external roadmap view can be generated. Either I have a special link to "External Roadmap" (maybe read-only web page or PDF). This external view should hide internal-only items. For example, internal roadmap has 5 items, but 1 is an infrastructure project (internal) that we don’t share, it’s marked internal so it doesn’t appear. The remaining 4 features show up but with broad timing: e.g., instead of specific Jan–Mar, it might just say "Q1 2024". Ideally, the system would allow me to switch to a view mode where time is coarser and items are just listed under Q1, Q2, etc. The output might be something like:

  - Q1 2024: Feature X, Feature Y (with short descriptions)
  - Q2 2024: Feature Z
  - H2 2024: Additional improvements in \[some area]
    Or a simplified timeline with no exact endpoints, just blocks under quarters. The acceptance is satisfied if I (with appropriate permission) can obtain a cleaned roadmap representation suitable for external sharing (no internal codenames, no exact dates that could set false expectations, no mention of internal tasks). If the product itself can’t automatically abstract all that, at least allow me to quickly toggle off what I don’t want and export. A common baseline: an “External PDF export” that the PM can quickly adjust (maybe manually remove sensitive items via a UI selection) and then export. The key is it saves time over manually creating slides, and it’s based on the live roadmap data, reducing the chance of inconsistencies.

- _As a product manager, I want to update the roadmap when plans change (e.g., a feature is delayed or descoped), and have that update reflected to all viewers and linked plans, so that everyone remains aligned on the new plan._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** Suppose Feature X was planned to end in Q2 but now will take until Q3. I click and drag its bar to extend into end of July. The system might prompt “Extend end date to July 30? This will push it past Release 5.0 milestone.” I confirm. The bar now spans into Q3. The Release 5.0 milestone in June might either stay (meaning Feature X misses that release) or we might move the release milestone too (if we decide to delay the release). If I also move the Release milestone to August, the system might prompt to align related features. I adjust accordingly. After making changes, the roadmap now clearly shows Feature X finishing in Q3, and Release 5.0 in Aug. All team members when they view the roadmap now see that update. The integrated backlog items for Feature X might also get their target release updated (maybe they were tagged for Release 5.0, now should be Release 5.1 in August – if integrated, EPMT might ask to update that link). In any case, acceptance is: I could easily change timeline bars and milestones to reflect new decisions. Perhaps an automatic notification could be sent to stakeholders: e.g., “Roadmap Update: Feature X now scheduled for Q3 (was Q2)” to keep people informed proactively. If not automatic, the PM can at least export the updated roadmap to share or mention it in meetings. The data consistency (roadmap vs backlog vs release definitions) should be maintained as much as possible.
- _As an executive, I want to see how the roadmap items align with our strategic objectives, so that I can ensure the team’s plans support our business goals._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** Each roadmap item can be associated with a strategic objective (like an OKR or a high-level goal). In the roadmap view, there could be an option to color code items by objective or group them by objective. For example, Objective 1 (Improve Retention) has 3 features across different quarters – perhaps I can filter to just those or see them highlighted. Alternatively, if using lanes as objectives, one lane per objective could be used (though lanes might already be used for teams/products). Another method: show icons or labels on each bar with the objective it supports. For acceptance: say I select a filter “Objective = Improve Retention”, the roadmap highlights or isolates the items linked to that objective. It shows, e.g., Feature X in Q2 and Feature Z in Q4 both tied to that objective. The executive sees that yes, things are planned for that objective at two times in the year. They might notice objective “Expand to New Markets” has only one small item – they raise a question that maybe we need more. Without such filtering, the exec would have to parse each feature name and infer objective alignment. So acceptance is that the tool provides a clear mapping mechanism. This could be as simple as including the objective in the item’s description and having a search filter match that text. But a structured link is better. If the company doesn’t use formal objectives in EPMT, the PM could group items by categories that align to objectives manually as a workaround. The ideal scenario is integrated: we consider that likely beyond MVP, but at least being able to label items and filter by label achieves a similar purpose (and PM can label items with objective name).
- _As a developer or team member, I want to understand the bigger picture of how my current work fits into the roadmap, so that I have context and can make informed decisions or suggestions._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** A developer might usually live in the backlog or dev tool, but they should have access to view the roadmap. They can open the roadmap module and see that the feature they are working on is part of an epic scheduled to finish by next month, for a release in May. They see there are other features in parallel slated for that release. This context might, for example, let them know that if they slip, it could affect the release. Or maybe they see an upcoming project in Q3 that touches an area they have expertise in, prompting them to prepare or give early input. The acceptance is that any internal user can easily view the roadmap (with the level of detail appropriate to them, maybe default to internal view for them). The roadmap should not be restricted to PMs only; it's a communication tool for the whole team. A test: have a developer user open the roadmap and verify they can see at least the high-level timeline and identify where their current sprint items fall (e.g., highlight current date shows they are in middle of a bar “Feature Y implementation” that ends in a month). If backlog integration is good, maybe clicking a roadmap item highlights linked backlog items or shows how percent complete is calculated (giving devs a sense of progress beyond their own tasks).

**Non-Functional Considerations (Roadmapping):**

- **Usability:** The roadmap interface should be intuitive like common project timeline tools (e.g., drag and drop Gantt chart style). The challenge is balancing detail and simplicity. It must avoid being as complex as full project management software (MS Project etc.) because PMs and many team members shy away from overly complex Gantt management. It should hit the sweet spot: easier than a spreadsheet to adjust, but not overbearing with dependencies and critical path calculations (unless toggled on).
- **Performance:** Handling a timeline view with many items – likely fine if we have at most tens of items visible at once. If someone attempts to put hundreds of tasks on the roadmap (not recommended – that should be handled at backlog level), the UI might become cluttered. We may enforce that only epics or high-level items go on roadmap, not every story. That naturally limits volume. Scrolling and zooming timeline should feel smooth. Possibly use canvas or SVG for drawing for performance, and virtualize item rendering.
- **Printing/Export:** A frequent use case is exporting to PDF or image to share. Ensure the output is clean (maybe omit grid lines, use high resolution). Possibly allow a one-click "Export to PDF" which generates a nice formatted page (with legend and title). This is important for executive presentations or client meetings where internet might not be used.
- **Real-time Updates:** If two PMs edit different parts of the roadmap (one adjusts an item on Lane A, another on Lane B), the changes should merge seamlessly. If they edit the same item concurrently, whichever saves last wins (some caution needed – maybe lock per item when editing). Alternatively, make edits batched (like user enters an edit mode and then saves all changes, which could conflict less since usually one person responsible at a time). Collaboration in roadmap might be less simultaneous than backlog, as typically one person is designated to maintain it, but not guaranteed.
- **Integration & API:** We should provide an API for roadmap data, so one could fetch roadmap items (for embedding in internal dashboards or generating custom reports). Also, integration triggers: e.g., when a backlog epic is completed, perhaps auto-mark roadmap item as done. Or if a roadmap item shifts, notify integrated calendars or backlog items. We must ensure consistency: e.g., if a PM changes a release date on roadmap, the Release object date should update (if we model releases separately). Conversely, if a release slip is recorded elsewhere, the roadmap should update. This suggests either a single source or a robust sync.
- **Security & Sharing:** External sharing needs to ensure no unauthorized access to internal data. If we have a public link, it should only show allowed items. We might implement external sharing as a generated static snapshot or require a login (with a special external account or a token in URL). Many companies share roadmaps publicly (like on their website via an iframe or portal) – we should allow that either via a secure token link or by exporting and manually posting.
- **Plan vs Actual tracking:** The roadmap is a plan. It could be useful to compare plan vs actual dates after the fact. Possibly, if a roadmap item finishes later than its planned end, we could highlight it or record actual end date. This is more advanced (post-mortem analysis). MVP can skip but consider data structure storing both planned and actual. Could even integrate with analytics to automatically set actual end when feature released.

The Product Roadmapping module fulfills the need to _“offer product roadmapping tools that visually track product development progress over time.”_ It allows linking high-level plans with execution and provides tailored views for different stakeholders. By using this module, teams can maintain alignment on timing and scope, and adjust plans transparently as conditions change, improving trust and coordination across the enterprise.

## Resource Allocation & Capacity Planning Module

**Description:** The Resource Allocation & Capacity Planning module helps match the **right people to the right tasks at the right time**. It provides visibility into team members’ workload and availability, ensuring that planning is grounded in reality of team capacity. By considering each person’s skills and current commitments, product managers and engineering managers can allocate tasks in a way that balances utilization and avoids overload. This module also supports long-term capacity planning: forecasting if additional resources are needed to meet planned roadmap goals, and allowing “what-if” analysis of scenarios (like if timeline is compressed or scope increased, can the team handle it?).

**Features & Functional Requirements:**

- **Team & Member Profiles:** Maintain a list of all team members (likely synced from the user directory). For each person, store:

  - _Role/Title_ (e.g., Frontend Engineer, QA Lead).
  - _Skills/Expertise_: perhaps a tag list (e.g., Java, React, UX Design, Spanish language, etc.). This will be used when searching for who can handle a task.
  - _Normal Capacity_: e.g., 40 hours/week or 8 story points/sprint (some metric of throughput). Possibly separate by type of work if relevant (some do capacity per skill, but to keep simple, one figure).
  - _Current Allocation_: the tool will compute this based on tasks assigned in backlog for a given period.
  - _Time Off & Holidays_: integration with a calendar or manual entry of dates they are unavailable. Could include company holidays, personal PTO, etc. On those days/weeks, their capacity is reduced to 0 or partial.
  - _Work Schedule_: maybe to handle part-timers (like if someone works 4 days a week, set that baseline).

- **Capacity View (Calendar or Timeline):** Provide a visualization of team capacity:

  - One view could be a calendar timeline (e.g., weeks on x-axis, team members on y-axis) with each person’s allocation per week. It might show bars indicating workload or simply numbers (like "Alice: 30h/40h used this week, Bob: 45/40 (over capacity)").
  - Another view could be per sprint, if using sprints: e.g., for Sprint 5, show each member and how many story points assigned vs capacity.
  - Possibly a heatmap: color-coded cells for each person per time period (green if under, red if over).

- **Workload Calculation:** The module should sum up all tasks assigned to a person in a given time period:

  - If tasks have estimates in hours or days, sum those overlapping a period.
  - If using story points per sprint, sum story points per sprint per person.
  - For tasks without explicit time estimate, maybe treat each as equal or prompt to assign a weight for capacity calculation.
  - Account for tasks in parallel vs sequential: if a person has two tasks due in same week, one 20h one 15h, total 35h for week, which is fine if 40h capacity. But if tasks have set durations overlapping in a way that exceeds daily hours, that detail might be too granular; assume distribution is manageable as long as total <= capacity.

- **Allocation Suggestions:** The system can suggest who is best to assign a task:

  - When a PM/EM is assigning a backlog item, a dropdown of users could be sorted by who has the skill required and has available capacity in the timeframe. For example, a task tagged “frontend” will bring up front-end engineers first, and highlight those under capacity. A visual might be each name followed by “(60% free next sprint)” or a green dot if free, red if at capacity.
  - If no one with that skill is free, maybe suggest rebalancing (or show that all are at 100%, requiring deprioritizing something else).
  - The PM/EM can override suggestions, of course.

- **Resource Planning Board:** Possibly a board where tasks can be assigned to people:

  - E.g., a table-like interface: columns as team members, rows as tasks (or vice versa).
  - One could drag tasks into a person’s column for a specific sprint or month.
  - This would effectively do assignment in bulk, and possibly schedule them in sequence if needed.
  - Alternatively, tasks can appear as cards on a timeline under each person’s row spanning their expected duration (like a personal Gantt for each resource).

- **Capacity Alerts:** Generate alerts when a person is overloaded:

  - If total assigned > capacity in a period, highlight in red or produce a warning “Bob is overbooked by 5 hours next week.”
  - If a new task assignment causes overload, warn at that moment (with option to assign anyway).
  - If capacity is consistently overloaded beyond a threshold, maybe escalate (e.g., notify PM “Team is over capacity for next sprint, consider descoping or adding resources”).

- **What-If Analysis Tools:**

  - Allow PM/EM to simulate adding or removing a resource:

    - E.g., “If we had an extra front-end dev in Q2, could we deliver Feature X earlier?” – The tool might allow adding a hypothetical person or increasing a person's capacity and seeing effect.
    - Or simulate shifting a feature’s timeline to see how resource load changes (tie-in with roadmap: if we move a project earlier, capacity view will show if team is over capacity in that period).

  - This is advanced; an MVP could simply allow manually toggling assignments or capacity numbers to see if warnings go away or appear.

- **Vacation/Leave Management:**

  - A calendar or form where each team member (or admin) can input their time off. E.g., Alice off Mar 10-20. The system marks those days as 0 capacity for Alice.
  - The capacity view should reflect that (maybe grey-out Alice for that period, or mark as “on leave”).
  - If tasks were assigned to her during her leave, those should cause alerts or need rescheduling (the PM might see a conflict icon).
  - Possibly integrate with company’s HR system or calendar to fetch holidays, etc. But could be manual to start.

- **Hiring & Team Size Planning:**

  - Provide a summary at team level: e.g., “Team total capacity vs allocated work per month”. If the roadmap/backlog indicates more work than team can handle for an extended period, it flags.
  - Perhaps a view: “Unassigned backlog items by quarter vs unallocated capacity.” If in Q4 the backlog items require 200 points but team capacity is projected 150, it shows a deficit.
  - This can justify hiring or outsourcing: the tool could even say "need \~1.3 more developers in Q4 to meet plan" by dividing deficit by average per dev.
  - It’s more an analytical output: the PM could generate a report from capacity planning that goes into headcount planning.

- **Integration with Backlog & Roadmap:**

  - The backlog assignment is essentially resource allocation for current/near-term tasks. The capacity module reads those assignments and durations to compute load.
  - Roadmap items (especially ones planned in future but not broken into tasks yet) could have placeholder “effort” (like Feature X \~ 100 person-days). If so, the capacity planning can block that time for certain roles in the future. For example, Q3: Feature X requires 50 days of front-end and 50 days of back-end. If unassigned, the tool can show that as demand that needs to be filled (maybe with a generic placeholder resource).
  - If tasks are not yet defined, allow high-level allocation: e.g., on roadmap item, assign “John (backend) 50% from Jul-Sep” and “Alice (frontend) 50% Jul-Sep” to meet its demands. This would then reflect in capacity view (it’s like reserving their time in advance). If later actual tasks are created, those should ideally align (or replace the placeholder).

- **Individual Load View:** Each team member might want to see what tasks are assigned to them and how full their schedule is.

  - Provide a “My Workload” view for individuals: e.g., list of tasks with dates or sprint assignment and maybe a graphical timeline of those tasks.
  - Show if they are over capacity (like “next week you have 5 tasks estimated total 50h, which is above your 40h”).
  - They might use that to raise a flag if needed (“I can’t realistically do all this in a week”).

- **Historical Utilization (to feed future planning):**

  - Perhaps track actual hours or story points completed vs capacity to refine capacities. If team consistently only completes 80% of planned points, then maybe effective capacity is 0.8 \* nominal. The tool could prompt adjusting velocity values.
  - Without timesheets, actual hours might not be known. But if integrated with time tracking or if using story points, we can gauge by how many points done per sprint per person or team.
  - For now, likely assume given capacity numbers and adjust manually when needed.

**User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (Resource Allocation & Capacity Planning):**

- _As an engineering manager, I want to see each team member’s workload for the upcoming sprint, so that I can ensure no one is overburdened and tasks are properly distributed._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** In the capacity view filtered to Sprint 5 (or March 1–15 time range), I see a list/table of team members. For each, a value or bar representing how many story points (or hours) are assigned to them in that sprint. Example: Alice – 8 points (capacity 10), Bob – 12 points (capacity 10, indicator red for over), Carol – 6 points (capacity 8). It’s clearly visible Bob is over capacity (maybe “120%” or a red bar extending beyond a limit line). I decide to reassign one of Bob’s stories to Carol. I drag the story from Bob to Carol or open it and change assignee. Immediately, the view updates: Bob down to, say, 9 points (90%, back to normal range, green), Carol up to 9 (112%, maybe now Carol slightly over; maybe I then adjust something else or accept slight over). The tool warns or shows exactly by how much Bob was over. After adjustment, all team members are at or below 100%. I lock the sprint plan. The acceptance is met if I can see the numeric loads and adjust assignments with immediate feedback on capacity usage. And, crucially, if someone is beyond capacity, it’s clearly flagged.
- _As a product manager, I want to identify if we have enough front-end engineering capacity next quarter to handle all planned front-end heavy features, so that we can adjust scope or hire if needed._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** I set a filter or view by role/skill and time: e.g., choose "Front-end" skill and Q3 2025. The module aggregates all planned tasks (or projected tasks from roadmap) that require front-end work in Q3. It also knows how many front-end engineers we have and their capacity (maybe 3 front-end devs, each 40h/week \~ 12 weeks = 1440h total for Q3, or if points, maybe 3 \* 20 points per sprint \* 2 sprints = 120 points available in Q3). It then sums demand: e.g., two big features in Q3 need \~160 points of front-end work (calculated from backlog tasks or an estimate field on the roadmap items). The system thus shows "Front-end: Capacity 120 points, Demand 160 points, Shortfall 40 points (33% over capacity)". This could be shown as a bar chart or a simple line “Over capacity by 33%”. The acceptance is that I can derive that insight from the tool – maybe by looking at a capacity report that lists each functional area or each person. Alternatively, I might see each front-end dev individually and notice each is planned at like 130% for that quarter. The tool might suggest "Consider adding 1 front-end developer or extending timeline." If integration is basic, the acceptance is at least that I can manually see that all front-end devs have full allocation and additional tasks have no one available, indicating a capacity gap. Ideally, the system would unify that and explicitly highlight the gap.
- _As a project manager (or scrum master), I want to simulate what happens if a team member goes on leave or if we get an additional resource, so that I can adjust plans accordingly._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** The interface allows toggling a team member’s availability. For instance, I mark Bob as on vacation for 2 weeks in June. Immediately, any tasks assigned to Bob in that period either show as conflict or his capacity line for those weeks drops to 0 and he has 80 hours of assignments with 0 capacity (meaning over infinite% capacity, clearly impossible). The tool flags that Bob is unavailable for tasks X, Y in that period. I then know to reassign those tasks to others (or move their schedule). Alternatively, I could set Bob’s capacity to 0 in those weeks and see a big red highlight for tasks during that time, prompting reschedule. On the flip side, I add a hypothetical new developer “NewDev” with skill “Backend” starting from July. The capacity view for Q3 now includes NewDev with, say, 80 hours capacity in Q3. I can then assign some of the backlog tasks originally planned for others to NewDev. After doing so, previously overloaded backend tasks are now distributed. The acceptance: the tool allows me to remove a resource’s availability and see the consequences (overloads) and also add capacity and see if it solves previously identified overloads (over capacity warnings go away). If not interactive, at least I can manually adjust capacity numbers and see difference (like if I change Bob’s capacity from 40h to 0 for June, obviously overload; or add capacity to someone to see if overload resolves). Ideally, it's interactive with what-if mode not affecting the actual plan until confirmed. But MVP could be done in a sandbox environment or on a copy of the plan.
- _As a developer, I want to understand how many tasks I have in the upcoming sprint and estimate if I can fit an additional small improvement, so that I can manage my commitments._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** The developer opens the capacity or “My Work” view for themselves for the next sprint. It shows: "Sprint 5: You have 5 tasks estimated total 32 hours (of 40h capacity)". Or "Sprint 5: 10 story points assigned (capacity 8 story points) – Over capacity". If over capacity, they see that and can discuss with EM/PM to reassign something. If under, they see they have \~20% free time. They have an idea for a small improvement that might take 1-2 days; seeing free capacity, they might propose to include it. The system itself might not automatically suggest that, but by giving the developer visibility, it empowers them. They could also double-check if tasks are unevenly distributed among team (maybe they see themselves underloaded while a colleague is overloaded, and volunteer to take something – the tool helps identify those imbalances, but actual reassign likely done by PM/EM). Acceptance: the developer can clearly see their load vs capacity for the sprint (or current week) without having to sum up hours from tasks manually. This implies tasks have estimates which is often true or at least relative sizing. If tasks lack numeric estimates, capacity might be measured just in count, which is less precise. But likely they have story points or hour estimates. The system should pick that up.
- _As a product manager, I want to ensure that all critical tasks have an owner assigned and no tasks fall through the cracks due to unassigned or mis-assigned resources, so that the project progresses smoothly._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** The capacity module or backlog can highlight unassigned tasks. Perhaps in capacity view, there’s an entry "Unassigned tasks: 3 tasks, 15 points, no owner". Or those tasks could appear in a pseudo lane "Unassigned" in a resource board. The PM sees that and assigns them to appropriate team members by dragging to a person. Also, if a task is assigned to someone without the needed skill, maybe a warning (less likely to catch unless skills are well-tagged on tasks and users). At the very least, unassigned tasks should be visible and filterable. The acceptance is that no item that’s scheduled for the current or next sprint is hidden as unassigned; the PM can easily find and allocate it. Possibly a rule: tasks in an active sprint must have an assignee – if not, flag it. If tasks are farther out, might remain unassigned until closer to time. The PM or EM can also use a search: e.g., search for "Unassigned AND Sprint 5" returns any stray tasks. If none, all good. This ensures accountability for each item.

**Non-Functional Considerations (Resource Allocation & Capacity Planning):**

- **Data Freshness:** The module must pull data from backlog (assignments, estimates) in real time or near real time. If a PM reassigns a task in backlog, the capacity view should update accordingly (especially if both modules are open by different users). Ideally use events or refresh triggers to keep it in sync.
- **Complexity vs Ease:** Resource planning can get complex (like leveling, dependencies). We aim to keep it relatively straightforward: treat each task’s allocation as affecting a time window, but not go down to daily scheduling granularity beyond what's needed for capacity. We likely won't simulate that Bob can do two tasks sequentially vs concurrently – we assume tasks in a sprint can be done in any order by Bob and will fit if total doesn't exceed capacity. That is sufficient for agile contexts.
- **Integration with HR Systems:** Not required initially, but being able to import org structure or holiday calendars from systems like Workday or an LDAP could save time. For now, perhaps allow uploading a CSV of holidays or manually entering them.
- **Security:** Personal data like availability or performance (how many tasks someone completes) should perhaps be restricted. E.g., an executive might not see the granular capacity view for each engineer (which could be misinterpreted as performance metrics). That said, in product context it might be fine to share within the product team. Possibly the module is limited to PMs and EMs for editing, and view for devs for their own or overall team. Stakeholders likely see summarized (like timeline of features, not who’s doing what exactly).
- **Performance:** Calculations are mostly simple summations – which is fine. If we have 100 team members and thousands of tasks, summing might be heavy but still okay; can use indexing and caching (like precompute assignments per person per sprint on backlog changes to avoid recalculating everything on the fly).
- **Scalability:** For large enterprises, maybe hundreds of users on a product. The capacity UI must handle showing a large team – might need grouping (by sub-team or discipline). Possibly allow grouping people by role or team in the view, collapsible sections. Eg. “Frontend Team (5 members) – collectively 200h capacity, 180h allocated” and then breakdown per member if expanded.
- **User Privacy:** If the tool is used for performance evaluation (not its intent), that could be sensitive. We should disclaim that capacity is for planning, not tracking exact hours worked. If integrated with actual time logs, then it crosses into timesheet territory which is delicate. Probably avoid time tracking, stick to planning figures.
- **Alerts and Emails:** If someone is overloaded or unassigned tasks exist for an imminent sprint, possibly email PM/EM as a reminder (like "Sprint 5 starts in 2 days and 3 tasks are unassigned"). This ensures issues are caught proactively. Non-critical but useful.
- **AI Assistance (future):** Possibly an AI could look at patterns and suggest "You often underutilize QA in mid-quarter; perhaps schedule more QA tasks or training during that time." Or "This new feature has no one with needed skill free, consider external contractor." This is beyond initial scope but the data collected by this module could feed such insights eventually.

By implementing these features, the Resource Allocation & Capacity Planning module directly supports the requirement to _“allocate resources to specific tasks based on employee strengths, skills, and availability.”_ It ensures that the planned work (from backlog and roadmap) is continuously checked against the team’s actual ability to execute it, highlighting mismatches. This leads to more realistic plans, timely identification of staffing needs, and an overall smoother development process where team members are neither overloaded nor under-utilized.

## User Feedback & Bug Tracking Integration Module

**Description:** The User Feedback & Bug Tracking Integration module ensures that **user feedback loops and quality issues** are tightly integrated into the product management system. It connects EPMT with external sources of feedback (like support tickets, user surveys, app reviews) and with bug tracking tools, allowing PMs to see a holistic view of all inputs that might affect the product. The module’s goal is to make user sentiment and product quality data first-class citizens in the product planning process, so that real user needs and pain points are addressed promptly and not lost in separate systems.

**Features & Functional Requirements (Feedback Integration):**

- **External Feedback Ingestion:** Set up connectors to gather feedback from various channels:

  - _Support Ticket Systems (e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk):_ EPMT can use an API or email parser to take tickets marked as feature requests or general feedback and create entries in the EPMT Feedback list. For instance, if a support agent tags a ticket with "Product Feedback", EPMT could automatically import the ticket subject and description as a feedback item (or an idea) with a link back to the ticket.
  - _Feedback Widgets/In-App Feedback:_ If the product has an in-app feedback form or uses a tool like Intercom, integrate so that messages submitted by users are captured. Basic integration might be via email (feedback emails forwarded to a special address that EPMT monitors) or via API. They would appear similar to ideas but perhaps in a separate “Feedback” queue if we differentiate "structured ideas" vs "general feedback".
  - _User Surveys & NPS:_ If an NPS survey is conducted (via SurveyMonkey, Delighted, etc.), EPMT can import the scores and comments. E.g., each NPS response comment could be a feedback item tagged with NPS and a score attached. The module could then report average NPS or list detractors’ comments for analysis.
  - _App Store/Play Store Reviews:_ Perhaps via a third-party API or manual import, gather app reviews for relevant keywords or categories. If a review mentions a specific feature or bug, a PM can turn it into an actionable item. This might not be automated for v1 but can be done manually by PM copying into EPMT as feedback.
  - _Social Media Mentions:_ Tools like Brandwatch exist, but likely out of scope; however, an open text field where PMs can log "Community feedback from Twitter" could be used if needed.

- **Feedback Repository:** Create a consolidated list of feedback entries (like a mini version of idea list but potentially more raw):

  - Each entry has source (support, survey, etc.), date, content, and optionally metadata like user or account name, sentiment (if known).
  - It can be linked to an idea or backlog item if it corresponds to one (e.g., many feedback entries might all link to "Idea #50: Improve Performance").
  - Perhaps allow grouping feedback by topic manually if not already in idea form.
  - Should have search (to find if a particular complaint has been reported how many times).

- **Sentiment Analysis (Optional):** For free-form feedback, integrate a basic sentiment analysis to auto-tag as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. E.g., if user says "I love this new feature", tag positive; "It crashes often, very unhappy" tag negative. This can help sort feedback (maybe PM might focus first on negative ones to address issues).

- **Link to Idea/Backlog:** PMs should be able to convert a feedback item directly into an idea or attach it to an existing idea or backlog item:

  - E.g., a support ticket complaining about missing dark mode can be attached to the "Dark Mode" idea (incrementing some counter of requests).
  - Or if it's a novel request, click "Promote to Idea" – creating a new idea from that feedback content.
  - If it's a bug report that somehow ended up as feedback (maybe user complaining of a bug through support rather than official bug channel), PM can create a backlog bug from it.
  - The link should be visible both ways: e.g., Idea #10 might show "5 linked feedback items" with source info (customer names perhaps anonymized).

- **Notification & Status back to Source:** If EPMT is integrated with support, when a feedback item is resolved (like the feature is implemented or the bug fixed), EPMT could trigger a message back to the support ticket to notify the customer. For example, it could either notify the support agent to reply or update the ticket status with a note ("Feature request implemented in version 5.0"). This closes the loop for customers who gave feedback through support.

- **Analytics on Feedback:**

  - Provide counts: e.g., "25 feedback entries in last month (15 neg, 5 pos, 5 neutral)".
  - Top categories of feedback (maybe by matching keywords or tags).
  - If integrated with idea upvotes, perhaps unify count: e.g., an idea has 50 upvotes and 10 support tickets linked; show combined "demand".
  - Possibly measure improvements: if a particular negative feedback topic was addressed, do we see fewer occurrences after release? (e.g., track frequency of mention of "slow performance" before vs after performance improvements).

- **Privacy & Sensitivity:** Feedback often contains sensitive info (customer data, etc.). Ensure any PII is handled per policy (maybe only certain roles can see full content or user details?). Likely PMs/support can see who said it for context, but external idea voters should not see support tickets details. E.g., if multiple support feedback are linked to an idea, an external user just sees "5 customers requested this" but not their names or exact transcripts.

- **Merge with Idea Portal (if needed):** If an idea portal exists, do we treat external ideas as feedback entries of type "Idea"? Possibly unify such that external ideas are just a subset of feedback (structured ones). Or keep separate: Idea portal is for proactive suggestions (mostly features), support feedback often includes issues and minor suggestions. We likely keep them conceptually separate but linkable. Possibly in UI, there's an "Ideas" section (voting ideas) and a "Feedback" section (misc feedback and tickets).

**Features & Functional Requirements (Bug Tracking Integration):**

- **Integration with Issue Trackers (e.g., Jira, GitHub):**

  - Many enterprises use Jira to manage bugs (and features). EPMT should integrate with Jira so that either:

    - EPMT itself doesn't become a separate bug tracker but pulls bug data from Jira (preferred if devs already track bugs there).
    - Or if EPMT logs bugs, it pushes them to Jira to get into dev workflow.

  - A two-way sync scenario:

    - When a new bug is created in EPMT (by QA or PM) and integration is on, automatically create a corresponding issue in Jira (with fields like title, description, severity, etc.). Perhaps tag it with a label or link it back (store EPMT ID in Jira custom field).
    - When a bug is reported in Jira by devs or QA (not via EPMT), EPMT fetches it if it's relevant (maybe all issues in a certain Jira project or with certain label flow into EPMT).
    - Status sync: if bug status changes in Jira (Dev fixes and closes it), EPMT updates its status to "Done". Conversely, if PM in EPMT marks bug as deferred or changes priority, that can reflect in Jira (maybe as a comment or field).
    - Comments might remain mostly in one place to avoid confusion (maybe developers comment in Jira, and PMs see those by clicking through).

  - If not using Jira, similar logic for other trackers (Azure DevOps, etc.) – likely we’d do one integration (Jira being common) for initial, others can follow.

- **Built-in Bug Tracker (if no external):**

  - If some teams don’t use an external tool, EPMT’s backlog can serve as their bug tracker (as described in backlog module). In that case, this module’s role is mostly to manage external bug inputs (like from customers or testing).
  - But if EPMT is the sole bug tracker, we might implement features like bug workflows (e.g., statuses New, Verified, Resolved, etc.), attaching logs or screenshots to bug entries, and maybe integrating with error monitoring systems (less likely initial).

- **Unified Backlog View:** Ideally, a PM can see in one place all work: features (from ideas) and bugs (from QA/customer). EPMT’s backlog does that by type. The integration ensures that if developers primarily handle bugs in an external tool, the PM still sees those bug items in EPMT (so they can prioritize them against features). For example, pulling “open critical bugs” from Jira into EPMT backlog automatically (maybe into a "Bug Backlog" section).

- **Bug Feedback Loop:** If customers report bugs via support, those should appear either directly in EPMT as feedback or bug items. Possibly the integration can: support ticket labeled "Bug" -> EPMT bug entry, similar to feature feedback. Or support directly logs into bug system (Jira Service Desk etc.), which then EPMT picks up through integration. There are several flows; we just need to ensure if a customer reports a bug, the product team in EPMT sees it and tracks it to closure.

- **Analytics on Quality:** Provide metrics like:

  - Number of open bugs by priority (like a mini dashboard: 5 Critical, 10 Major, 20 Minor open).
  - Bug trends: how many new bugs opened vs closed per week (like a burn down of bug backlog).
  - Perhaps bug density by feature (if backlog items are mapped to components).
  - If integrated with releases: after a release, how many bugs were reported? E.g., "Release 5.0: 3 critical, 5 minor bugs reported in first week" – this is also part of release analytics.

- **Automated Bug Logging (maybe later):** Integration with crash reporting (like Sentry) to automatically create bug items for exceptions. Might be too dev-focused for a product management tool though – likely leave that to dev tools and have devs create bug items for major ones.

- **Categorization & Linking:** Similar to ideas linking to feedback, a bug might link to an idea or epic if it’s part of a feature. If multiple customers report the same bug, link those support cases to one bug item.

- **Communication Back:** When a bug is fixed, if it was reported by certain customers, either automatically or via support integration, notify them (like "Your reported issue has been resolved in version X"). This can be done by support team via normal processes, but EPMT could facilitate by listing which tickets were linked to the bug so support can follow up.

**User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (Feedback & Bug Integration):**

- _As a support agent, I want the product team to automatically see important product feedback from tickets I handle, so that I don’t have to manually forward each request and I know it will be considered._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** The agent tags a support ticket with "Product Request" in Zendesk. Within a short time (say 10 minutes or less), an entry appears in EPMT’s feedback list: it contains the ticket ID, the customer name (if passed, or we may anonymize to Company if B2B), and the message content. The PM gets notified or can see a new feedback entry "Customer ACME Corp requests feature to export data." The entry is labeled source=Zendesk with a link back (so PM can view full conversation if needed). The PM then converts it to an idea or links to an existing idea about "Data export". The support agent, on the ticket, might see an internal note like "Forwarded to PM tool as IDEA-45". Now, when PM updates that idea to "Planned", perhaps the integration can update the ticket. For acceptance: after tagging the ticket, the agent does not have to separately email PM; the PM indeed sees it in EPMT and perhaps acknowledges it (even possibly adding a note that syncs back "Thanks, we've noted this in our roadmap"). At minimum, the agent trusts the system as they see the ticket show up in PM’s domain. The PM, in EPMT, sees the content and origin clearly.

- _As a product manager, I want all high-severity bugs from our bug tracker to show up in my backlog automatically, so that I can prioritize and track them along with feature work._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** Suppose developers use Jira for all bugs. EPMT is configured to sync Jira project "XYZ" issues of type Bug that are Priority = Critical or Major. In EPMT’s backlog, perhaps under a filter or separate list "Open Bugs", I see those Jira issues. For example, Jira issue XYZ-101 (Critical bug) appears in EPMT with title, description summary, status "Open". I can drag it in my priority list among other items or mark it as “Must fix in next release”. If I do so (maybe adding a tag or linking to a release), that might write back something to Jira (like adding label "PlannedForRelease5.0" or just remain internal). When a dev fixes and closes XYZ-101 in Jira, within a short time EPMT updates the item’s status to Done (or maybe removes it from open bug list). Conversely, if I mark a bug in EPMT as "Deferred" or change priority, it could update the Jira field or comment for devs to see. But the key acceptance: I, as PM, did not have to constantly ask devs for bug status – I can see it in real-time and include it in my overall product status. If I generate a status report from EPMT, it includes "We have X open critical bugs affecting timeline." Without integration, I might forget a bug or rely on separate tracking. So measure: a critical bug logged by QA in Jira is visible to PM in EPMT backlog within e.g., 10 minutes at most. And closure sync is working too.

- _As a QA lead, I want to log a new bug and have it seamlessly enter the developers’ workflow and the product backlog, so that it gets addressed and visible to all relevant parties._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** If QA logs bug in EPMT (if we have them do it here) and integration is on, it should appear in dev’s Jira. Or if QA logs in Jira (more likely), it should appear in EPMT. One flow acceptance: QA uses EPMT to create a bug item (maybe they prefer one tool). Upon saving, EPMT via integration creates Jira issue XYZ-202. Jira devs see it in their backlog. EPMT item gets updated with the Jira ID link. The status is "New". A developer picks it in Jira, sets status to In Progress – EPMT could either reflect that (if we sync statuses like that, optional) or at least not needed for PM, they mainly care open vs done. Developer fixes, marks Resolved in Jira – EPMT bug item updates to Done. The QA lead sees in EPMT it's now Done, and can then mark it Verified after testing (maybe adding a comment). If QA reopened, that would sync back to Jira reopen. The acceptance is that whether QA enters bug in either system, it flows to the other reliably, and no bug gets lost. Additionally, EPMT backlog counts it in open bug counts.

- _As a product manager, I want to analyze all customer feedback and support tickets to identify common pain points, so that I can prioritize improvements that will increase customer satisfaction._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** In EPMT’s feedback section, I can filter or generate a report on common keywords or categories. For example, I filter feedback by tag "UI Issue" and see 12 entries complaining about "navigation confusion". I also filter by sentiment negative and see top 5 recurring themes (maybe via tags I applied or an auto-categorization). The system might not fully auto-categorize, but I might notice many mention "slow" – I search "slow" and get 8 feedback items referencing performance. That tells me performance is a pain point across multiple customers. I then can create a new backlog item "Performance improvements initiative" and link those feedback to it to justify it. The acceptance: by having all feedback in one searchable place, I was able to discover a pattern that I might miss if scanning each support ticket individually. If the system has a basic analytic: e.g., a word cloud of most frequent nouns in feedback comments, and "speed/performance" stands out larger, that could be a nice feature to directly highlight such insights. I'd accept success if at least a manual search and filter allowed me to gather that evidence in under 10 minutes which would otherwise take hours reading separate systems.

- _As an executive, I want to ensure that user feedback (especially negative feedback) is trending down after we make improvements, so that I know we are actually increasing customer satisfaction._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** The PM can use EPMT to track metrics like NPS or count of certain types of feedback over time. For example, in the release analytics or a separate feedback analytics: show NPS score quarter by quarter (if we integrated NPS input) – maybe NPS was 20, now 30 after feature improvements. Or count of "complaint" tickets per month – maybe it dropped from 50 to 20 post-release. The system could generate a simple chart if data present: e.g., "Negative feedback entries per month" showing a downward trend, and maybe link to events (release in Feb might correlate to drop in March complaints). If not fully automated, at least EPMT has the data in tables and I could export or manually compile. But a built-in metric such as "NPS: was 25, now 40" or "User satisfaction survey average up from 3.5 to 4.0" would directly support this. The acceptance is somewhat broad but let's say after implementing top requested features in Q1, the PM can pull a quick stat: "we had 30 negative feedbacks in Jan, only 10 in Apr" which the exec sees (maybe via a dashboard or written by PM). For v1, we might rely on manual or external analysis for precise stats, but ensuring all relevant data is accessible in one place is key.

- _As a developer or QA, I want to know if a bug I’m working on was reported by customers and how urgent it is, so that I can prioritize correctly and possibly reach out for more info if needed._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** In EPMT (or via Jira if info syncs), a bug entry that came from customer feedback or multiple support tickets should reflect that: e.g., a field "Reported by: 5 customers (ACME Corp, BetaCo, ...)" or at least "Customer Impact: Yes (links to 3 tickets)". The developer sees that in the bug description or comments. This gives context that it's not just a test found issue but something affecting customers in production, thus higher urgency. If they need more context (like exact steps environment), they could click the linked ticket to see details (assuming permissions or via a product manager). The acceptance is that important metadata from the support side (like how many users hit this bug) is visible to the dev working on it. Many times devs don't see support data and might underestimate the priority, but with integration, they realize "oh, 10 users complained, we better fix this asap." This fosters empathy and proper prioritization at dev level too.

**Non-Functional Considerations (Feedback & Bug Integration):**

- **Data Volume & Frequency:** Support systems can generate a lot of tickets. We should allow filtering what to sync to EPMT to avoid noise (e.g., only certain tags or only from certain queues). Also, not every trivial feedback needs to be in PM tool; perhaps only those marked by support or certain severity. We must fine-tune to avoid flooding PMs with hundreds of entries (maybe initial integration tests can refine rules).
- **Latency:** Integration doesn't have to be real-time, but should be reasonably prompt (within minutes to an hour). Some systems have webhooks for instant push (preferred). If not, polling every X minutes is fine but ensure rate limits and not missing data.
- **Data Consistency:** Ensure duplicates aren't created (e.g., if a support ticket is updated, don't create a new feedback entry each time; one entry should update, or ideally entries are one per ticket). Possibly use unique IDs to avoid duplication.
- **Error Handling:** If an integration fails (API down, auth expired), alert the admin so they can fix it (and possibly backlog items like "can't fetch bugs" should be noticed). The system should degrade gracefully (if bug integration fails, PM might have to manually check Jira until fixed).
- **Security & Permissions:** The integration will use credentials for external systems, to be stored securely (encrypted). Only authorized roles can set those up (admin/PM). Also, ensure that we only fetch data that the organization’s own users are allowed to see (e.g., if integration is set up with an account that can see all support tickets across all products, but PM only should see their product's, filter by product). Also internal data (like internal bug comments) might remain in Jira and not come to EPMT to avoid exposing internal dev chatter to a wider PM audience if not desired (though PM likely have access anyway).
- **Scalability:** If ingesting thousands of support tickets or bug records, ensure EPMT can handle it in its DB. Maybe archive or auto-close feedback after certain time especially if it's been resolved.
- **Integration Config UI:** Provide a simple interface for admins to input API keys, choose which project/queues to integrate, mapping fields (like which ticket field corresponds to idea category or severity mapping between systems). Perhaps use predefined connectors for major systems to reduce config complexity.
- **User Training:** Support and QA teams need to know how to properly tag or input data to trigger these flows. Provide documentation (like "Tag with 'Product Feedback' to send to PMs"). The integration's usefulness partly depends on proper usage by those teams.
- **Unified Search:** The PM might want to search across ideas, feedback, and bugs at once for a keyword. Possibly our global search can encompass all integrated data (like search "CSV export", it finds an idea with that title and 2 support tickets that mention it, and a bug maybe). That would be powerful, but requires indexing all content (which we likely will do anyway in our DB for what's imported).
- **Privacy/GDPR:** If feedback includes personal data (names, emails, health info, etc.), the PM tool must handle it carefully. Possibly allow deleting or anonymizing feedback entries if requested by user. Also, storing customer data in PM tool might be an issue in some cases, but since it's for internal use likely fine as long as the product environment is secure. Might need ability to purge or pseudo-anonymize after some time (like keep content but remove user identity).
- **No Duplicate Effort:** The integration should ensure product team doesn’t have to do double entry. E.g., if a support agent already wrote up a good explanation in the ticket, the PM tool should use that rather than requiring rewriting an idea. Conversely, if a dev wrote an extensive analysis in Jira, PM shouldn’t have to copy that to brief others - perhaps link suffice. So we lean on linking and referencing rather than duplicating all discussions in both places (that can cause divergence).
- **Encourage Single Source for certain actions:** E.g., let devs close bugs in Jira, not require closing in EPMT too. EPMT should accommodate that by syncing, not by expecting separate action. Similarly, let support handle ticket closure with customers, EPMT doesn’t directly email customers (unless configured). Focus EPMT on capturing and sending status to the right system, not interacting with end users itself (we don't want EPMT accidentally emailing a customer something incorrectly).

By implementing these integration features, EPMT addresses the requirement to _“natively provide or integrate with user feedback analytics tools and bug tracking platforms.”_ It ensures that user feedback and bug reports flow into product planning, enabling the team to prioritize critical fixes and improvements based on real user data, ultimately leading to a product that better satisfies user needs and maintains high quality.

## Product Release Analytics Module

**Description:** The Product Release Analytics module provides tools to **evaluate the success and impact of product releases**. It aggregates data from various sources (analytics, user feedback, support, etc.) to give a comprehensive view of how a release is performing post-launch. The focus is on key metrics such as adoption, usage, performance, and user satisfaction for features delivered in each release, allowing product teams to measure outcomes against goals. This data-driven approach closes the loop: features go from idea to implementation (roadmap/backlog) to release, and then their actual results are fed back to inform future decisions.

**Features & Functional Requirements:**

- **Release Definition & Info:** The module builds on the notion of "Release" (which might already exist as an entity in backlog/roadmap). Each Release entry would have:

  - A version number or name (e.g., 5.0, Spring 2025 Release).
  - A date (actual release date, and possibly planned date).
  - The list of features/epics delivered in that release (automatically derived if backlog items were tagged to that release).
  - Optionally, objectives or hypotheses for that release (e.g., "Improve conversion by 5%", "Reduce support tickets by 20%").

- **Usage Analytics Integration:** Connect with product analytics to fetch metrics for features:

  - Track usage of new features: e.g., "Feature X daily active users" or "Number of times Feature X used per day".
  - Compare before/after release metrics for changed features (if a feature is revamped).
  - Overall product usage changes: e.g., DAU (daily active users), MAU (monthly), session length, etc., comparing pre-release baseline vs post-release.
  - If the product has conversion funnel, measure if release improved any funnel metrics (like conversion rate from trial to paid increased after new onboarding was introduced).
  - Possibly integrate with tools like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc., via their APIs to get these numbers. For v1, could start with manual data entry or CSV import if direct integration is complex.

- **User Feedback & Satisfaction Analytics:**

  - Use feedback system to gauge sentiment changes:

    - e.g., count of negative feedback items per week before vs after release.
    - NPS or CSAT scores from surveys collected after release (if integrated).
    - If using app ratings, see if app rating improved after releasing new version.

  - Display maybe: "Average user rating before v5.0: 3.8, after v5.0: 4.2" or "NPS increased from 25 to 40 post-release".
  - Summarize top feedback themes about the release (did people love Feature A? Did new complaints arise? Possibly via scanning feedback entries tagged with that release).

- **Quality Metrics:**

  - Show bug counts related to the release: "X bugs were reported in first two weeks after release" (which should hopefully be low if quality good). This data comes from bug tracking integration.
  - Performance metrics: if release had performance improvements, show e.g., "Avg page load time improved from 4s to 2s after release" (if integrated with monitoring like New Relic or if we have such data).
  - Uptime if relevant (maybe not needed if just feature changes, but if release caused stability issues, that should be captured).

- **Goal vs Actual Tracking:** If the team set specific goals for the release (which could be recorded in EPMT as part of release planning), allow input or integration to actual results:

  - e.g., Goal: +5% user retention, Actual: +7% (show in green as achieved).
  - Goal: 100 new enterprise sign-ups, Actual: 70 (red, not met).
  - This requires either manual entry of actuals or pulling from data source. Possibly a simple UI where PM can enter outcome values if auto isn't available.
  - A summary on release page could list each goal with achieved or not.

- **Release Summary Dashboard:** Each release should have a dashboard with key indicators:

  - _Adoption:_ e.g., percentage of user base that has started using new features, number of upgrades to new version (for mobile apps, how many have updated).
  - _Engagement:_ e.g., increase in usage time or frequency (if that was a target).
  - _Feedback rating:_ e.g., thumbs-up vs thumbs-down ratio from feedback on new features (if we had a user feedback prompt).
  - _Support Impact:_ e.g., number of support tickets related to new features, or reduction in certain ticket types after release (like if release fixed issues).
  - Possibly use visualizations: line charts for usage over time, bar charts for before/after comparisons, pie for distribution of feedback sentiment.

- **Timeframe and Cohort Analysis:** For adoption, might consider cohort (like usage among users who got the new feature vs those who didn’t if a phased rollout).

  - Simpler: show usage from release date onward (post vs pre).
  - If partial roll-out or A/B test, allow comparing metrics of experiment vs control group (though that likely uses external experiment platform – maybe v1 skip detailed A/B analysis inside EPMT).

- **Trend Analysis:** Show trends around release:

  - Graph of daily active users 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after release – expecting a jump or some change, or stable if no user-facing changes.
  - Graph of support ticket volume or sentiment mentions for a month around release.
  - This helps attribute any changes to the release event.

- **Integration with Roadmap & Backlog context:** Possibly on a roadmap item or epic, after release, show its specific success metrics. E.g., on Epic "Improve onboarding", after release, show "New user activation increased 15%". This ties outcome back to original epic easily.

  - The release analytics module can feed that – it knows "Epic 123 was in Release 5.0, and metrics improved 15%", it could update Epic 123's status or notes with that info for historical record.

- **Archiving & History:** Keep historical data for each release. So PMs can compare releases (maybe a table of all releases with columns: date, features delivered count, adoption %, satisfaction change, etc.). Executives might like a high-level view: "last 4 releases and their outcomes" – which could highlight consistent improvements or issues.

- **Manual Data Input Option:** If not all data sources integrated, allow PM to enter key figures manually to still use this module as a reporting tool. For example, they might manually enter "Feature X usage +20%" from an external analytics if not directly connected. The tool could allow editing a metric value for a release and maybe attach evidence (like a screenshot of an analytics report) if needed. Not ideal but ensures the narrative is captured.

- **Notification of Achievements:** If a particular release hits a milestone (like user adoption goal met), maybe notify team for morale – "Release 5.0 achieved goal of +5% daily usage!" – more of a nice-to-have.

**User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (Release Analytics):**

- _As a product manager, I want to see how users are interacting with the new features introduced in the latest release, so that I can measure if those features are being adopted and used as expected._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** After Release 5.0 (launched say April 1), I open the Release Analytics for 5.0. I see a section "Feature Usage": it lists each major feature delivered (maybe those tied to epics or flagged as "user-facing" in backlog). For each:

  - Feature A: 500 unique users used it in first week, representing 25% of active users.
  - Feature B: 1000 uses overall, average 2 times per user, trending upward.
  - If there was a goal (like expecting 300 users use Feature A), it might show "Goal 300, Actual 500 (👍)".
  - A chart might show daily count of users using Feature A for first 14 days, which I can see trending up or if it plateaued.
    This data likely comes from an integrated analytics. If not integrated, I might have input the values but still expecting the system to display it neatly. The acceptance is that I can quantify adoption: e.g., "25% of our users tried the new feature in the first week." That number is readily available on the analytics dashboard. If I see it's low (like 5%), that signals an adoption problem. Possibly there's also a breakdown by user segment if provided (e.g., out of premium users vs free, etc., but probably advanced). At minimum, overall usage is shown.

- _As an executive, I want to know if the recent release improved our key business metrics (like user growth or retention), so that I can judge the release’s success in delivering value._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** The Release 5.0 analytics might have a section "Key Metrics Impact". For example:

  - Monthly Active Users: before release (Mar) 10,000; after release (Apr) 11,000 – a 10% increase.
  - User retention (30-day): improved from 40% to 45% in cohort that experienced new onboarding.
  - Conversion Rate: remained flat at 5% (meaning the release didn’t target conversion or no effect).
    The dashboard might show this in a summary table or bullet points. If goals were set (like retention +5%), it would mark that as achieved. The acceptance is that I, as an executive, can look at the Release summary and see "MAU +10%, retention +5%, NPS +10 points" (for instance) in one glance. Possibly an overall grade or indicator "Release 5.0 outcome: Success (met 2/3 targets)". If something went down (maybe if any metric worsened), that should be highlighted in red (and then PM can explain why). This way the business outcome is clearly tied to the release. Without integration, PM might manually enter these metrics from their BI tools. With integration, EPMT could pull from a data warehouse or analytics aggregator for high-level metrics. But initial, manual is fine if presented nicely.

- _As a customer success manager, I want to be aware of any increase in support tickets or negative feedback after a release, so that I can proactively reach out to affected customers or alert the product team if needed._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** The Release 5.0 analytics would have a "Quality/Support" section:

  - "Support tickets related to this release: 3 in first week (all minor questions, no major issues)."
  - Or if there was a problem: "20 bug reports were filed within 3 days of release (above normal), specifically around the new Feature B."
  - It might show a chart of daily support tickets tagged with v5.0 or a count vs previous release baseline (like normally 5 tickets/day, spiked to 15 on release day then back to 5).
  - Negative feedback count: perhaps "2 negative feedback items referencing new UI" vs "10 positive feedback praising Feature A".
    If integrated with support or feedback:
  - EPMT could detect tickets mentioning "5.0" or the new features and count them.
  - Or simply track any new bug entries and feedback flagged as after release.
    The acceptance is that on the release report, there's an indication of how smooth the release was (e.g., low support volume = smooth, or high = issues). The CSM sees, for example, "some users had trouble with new navigation (5 feedback comments), product team is addressing." That helps them prepare responses or monitor their accounts. If nothing major, it assures them release is stable. This info should be timely (maybe updated in first days post-release).

- _As a product manager, I want to document and share what we learned from the release in terms of user behavior and metrics, so that we can incorporate these learnings into our next cycle._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** After analyzing the release data, I can add commentary or notes in EPMT’s release record: e.g., a text field "Release Retrospective Notes". I might write "Feature A was a hit, usage exceeded expectations by 2x. However, Feature B saw low adoption – likely needs better in-app promotion. Support tickets around confusing navigation indicate we need to tweak the UI in next patch." I save these notes. The system keeps them associated with Release 5.0. When I present to stakeholders or the team, I pull up the release dashboard in EPMT which includes those notes and all the metrics. So we have a single consolidated artifact for the release outcome. The acceptance is that I can record such qualitative analysis in the tool (not just raw metrics) and share it easily (e.g., by giving exec access to view, or exporting to PDF with notes included). If the tool can't include notes, PM would have to compile a separate doc. But having at least a scratchpad or notes field per release is valuable. That way later someone can look back and see "why did we drop Feature B? oh, because it wasn’t used as per release X analysis." – knowledge retention.

- _As a UX researcher or product designer, I want to see how changes in user experience affected user behavior metrics and feedback, so that I can validate design decisions._
  **Acceptance Criteria:** Suppose in Release 5.0 we redesigned the onboarding flow. The release analytics shows "User activation increased from 50% to 70% after new onboarding" and "Average time to complete onboarding reduced from 5 min to 3 min". These are metrics the UX researcher cares about as proof the new design worked. Also feedback: maybe see quotes from feedback like "Love the new sign-up process, much smoother" aggregated in the positive feedback portion. If integrated with a tool like FullStory or user testing results (probably out of scope), not likely; but at least high-level outcomes suffice. The researcher can trust the analytics page for evidence, rather than pulling separate analytics themselves. If the research had an explicit success criterion, it should reflect in goals vs actual. So acceptance is partly overlapping with prior ones – basically the system captured the important user behavior changes such that even non-PM roles can glean that info from the shared dashboard.

**Non-Functional Considerations (Release Analytics):**

- **Data Integration Complexity:** Gathering metrics from multiple sources (analytics, NPS, etc.) is challenging. For MVP, perhaps we rely on manual input for some and basic integration for easy ones (like if product has Google Analytics events, use their API). The architecture should allow plugging in different data sources gradually. Perhaps an intermediate approach: allow uploading CSV or using an API endpoint to feed EPMT certain metric values. If a company has a data team, they might feed EPMT via its API with metrics after release. We should define a consistent schema for metrics (like identify by release and metric name).
- **Timing:** Ensure metrics are captured after sufficient time. The PM might specify a "stabilization period" or check metrics at certain intervals (e.g., 1 week after, 1 month after). The tool might default to comparing one month before vs one month after. Should allow adjusting the window. Possibly have dynamic updates (some metrics can show daily progress in near real-time).
- **Accuracy & Attribution:** It's sometimes hard to attribute changes purely to the release because other factors may be at play (seasonality, marketing campaigns). The module can present data but interpretation is up to PM. Perhaps allow to annotate if something external influenced metrics (e.g., note "marketing promotion in same period likely contributed to user increase").
- **Security & Privacy:** Analytics data might be sensitive (e.g., revenue numbers). Ensure only appropriate roles see them. Possibly restrict full release analytics to PMs and execs, not every team member if it includes confidential business metrics. Could have a sanitized version for broader team (like usage metrics but not revenue).
- **Performance:** Calculating metrics might involve processing lots of data (if integrated). We likely rely on external analytics to do heavy lifting (they provide aggregated results). EPMT just displays them. If manual, trivial performance impact.
- **Storage:** Storing historical metrics over releases is fine (numbers for each release are small). If storing time series for charts (like daily usage counts), that's more data but manageable (some hundreds of points maybe per metric per release). Possibly integrate with a time-series DB if we did heavy charts, but probably not needed at small scale.
- **Flexibility:** Each product might care about different metrics. We should allow custom metrics to be defined per release. E.g., one product might track "API response time", another "Trial conversion rate". Provide a way to add a metric name and input a value or link to data.
- **User Interface:** The analytics should be clear and not overly cluttered. Use simple visuals and highlight key numbers. Possibly use color coding (green for improvement, red for decline). Should be presentable in meetings directly from app or via quick export to slides.
- **Actionability:** The module should not only display data but also tie it back to backlog if needed. For example, if "Feature B low adoption" is identified, the PM can directly create a backlog item like "Improve Feature B adoption" from the analytics view (or mark in release retrospective). Or if "Performance still an issue (load time 4s, goal 2s not met)", the PM might immediately schedule another performance epic. Possibly, clicking a failing metric could prompt "Create improvement item?" This is a nice interactive aspect to show analytics driving backlog adjustments.

By implementing Release Analytics, EPMT fulfills the requirement to _“natively provide product release analytics to evaluate the performance and adoption of new releases.”_ It completes the product management loop by verifying if delivered features achieved the desired outcomes, thereby informing continuous improvement and demonstrating the value delivered to stakeholders.

## Workflows

This section illustrates how the different modules and features come together in end-to-end **user workflows**. Understanding these workflows helps ensure the system supports each step in a cohesive manner and meets user needs across modules.

### Workflow 1: Idea to Feature to Release (End-to-End)

1. **Capture & Curate Idea:** A customer submits an idea via the Ideas portal for "Bulk Data Export". The Idea Management module captures it (Idea #104). It gathers 50 votes and several supportive comments over a few weeks. The PM reviews it, tags it as "Reporting/Data" and scores it highly in value. They change status to "Under Review".
2. **Promote to Backlog:** During quarterly planning, the PM decides to implement "Bulk Data Export". In EPMT, they click "Promote to Backlog" on Idea #104. This creates a backlog Epic "Bulk Data Export" with initial description from the idea. Idea #104 status auto-updates to "Planned" and voters are notified.
3. **Backlog Detailing & Prioritization:** The PM breaks the Epic into user stories (with input from tech lead): "Export UI", "Export API endpoint", "Permission checks", etc. These are backlog items under the epic. The EM estimates them (e.g., total 20 points) and the PM prioritizes the epic near the top of backlog (since high votes). In backlog module, the PM sets target release = 5.1 for this epic and assigns team members.
4. **Resource Allocation:** The EM opens the Capacity view for the upcoming sprint(s) where this epic will be worked. They assign the "Export API" task to Alice (back-end) and "Export UI" to Bob (front-end) for Sprint 7. The capacity view shows Alice and Bob are within capacity. A QA task is slated for Carol in Sprint 8. The module confirms no one is overloaded.
5. **Development & Tracking:** As Sprint 7 proceeds, Bob updates "Export UI" to In Progress (via Kanban board). Alice completes "API" and marks Done. Carol logs a bug during testing in Sprint 8 ("Export fails on large files"). Through integration, this bug appears in EPMT backlog. The PM sees it and pushes it into Sprint 8 backlog, assigned to Alice. The bug is fixed quickly.
6. **Roadmap Alignment:** On the Roadmap, "Bulk Data Export (Epic)" bar shows spanning Q2 (Apr-Jun). As tasks complete, the bar fills to 100%. By mid-June, the epic is done. The PM marks Epic complete, and the Roadmap item turns green with a checkmark. Release 5.1 is scheduled end of June containing this feature.
7. **Release & Analytics:** Release 5.1 launches. The Release Analytics module tracks metrics: by July, 200 customers have used the data export (20% of the user base) – exceeding the PM's success criterion of 10%. Support tickets on "how to export data" initially spike (5 tickets first week) but then drop after documentation improved. NPS from data-oriented customers rises. The PM enters a note: "Bulk Export highly adopted, positive feedback; will consider extending to more formats."
8. **Feedback Loop Closure:** Idea #104 (which originated this feature) is marked "Completed". EPMT sends an email to all 50 voters: "Bulk Data Export is now live in v5.1 – thank you for your suggestion!" Support tickets linked to this request automatically get an update (via Zendesk integration) notifying agents to inform those customers.

_Result:_ The idea moved smoothly from suggestion to implementation to measurable impact, with EPMT supporting each step (capturing votes, planning in backlog, aligning resources, communicating status, and measuring outcome).

### Workflow 2: Bug Escalation and Resolution

1. **Bug Report Intake:** A user encounters a glitch (app crashes on login) and reports it via support. The support agent tags it as "Urgent Bug". EPMT’s integration picks it up and creates a feedback entry or bug item "Crash on login – reported by User X" with high priority.
2. **Triage & Backlog:** The QA lead sees this bug in EPMT (either via feedback list or directly as a bug in backlog if auto-created). They attempt to reproduce and succeed – it's a critical bug. They update the bug entry severity to Critical. The PM/EM gets alerted (perhaps via an email from EPMT or simply seeing backlog red flag).
3. **Prioritization:** The PM immediately pulls this bug into the current sprint backlog (or creates a hotfix sprint for it) and assigns it to a developer, Dan, with highest priority. In Capacity view, Dan was at full capacity, but this bug is critical. The EM decides to pause one of Dan's lesser tasks (reassign or move out of sprint) to free capacity for this bug – they do so in EPMT (drag that task to next sprint). Now Dan's load is balanced to include the bug fix instead.
4. **Development:** Dan works on the bug. Through Jira integration, as Dan logs work and comments in Jira, the PM can see updates in EPMT (e.g., bug status -> In Progress). QA creates a test case for it. Dan fixes the bug and marks it resolved in Jira. EPMT marks the bug item Done. The PM moves the bug item to the release that will carry the fix (if a hotfix release 4.2.1, they mark it accordingly).
5. **Release & Communication:** The fix is deployed (maybe as a hotfix or included in the next minor release). The support ticket that originated this bug is updated via integration – the agent gets notified "Bug resolved in version 4.2.1". They inform the user. The Feedback integration module also logs that feedback item as "Completed/Resolved".
6. **Post-Mortem:** The PM adds a note in Release Analytics or bug entry: "Login crash – fixed within 2 days, root cause a null pointer, added more QA for login flows." They might also count that critical bug in metrics (release analytics might show "1 critical bug fixed").
7. **Preventive Action:** The PM or EM creates a backlog task to add an automated test for this scenario (to avoid regression), linking it to the bug for context. This is scheduled in next sprint.

_Result:_ The critical bug was captured, prioritized, and resolved rapidly thanks to integration between support, backlog, and dev tools. Nothing fell through cracks: the support agent's tag led to PM visibility, the dev got the task in their workflow, and the user was notified of the resolution, all managed through EPMT.

### Workflow 3: Roadmap Communication and Adjustment

1. **Roadmap Presentation:** At the start of Q3, the PM prepares for an executive review. They use EPMT's Roadmap module set to a 4-quarter view. It shows major initiatives: e.g., Q3 – "Feature Y Beta", Q4 – "Feature Y GA & Marketing Launch", Q1 next year – "New Mobile App". They use the filter to hide internal tech-only items, focusing on deliverables. They present directly from this view, highlighting that Feature Y is on track for end of Q4.
2. **Stakeholder Feedback:** The sales VP says a key customer really wants Feature Y sooner, by Q3 if possible. After discussion, the team decides to try releasing a basic version (beta) earlier. The PM, in the meeting, drags "Feature Y Beta" bar on the roadmap from spanning Q3–Q4 to Q3 (shortening it) and adds a new bar "Feature Y Enhancements" in Q4 for improvements. They mark "Feature Y Beta" as external visible. The roadmap now shows a Beta in Q3 and further work in Q4.
3. **Backlog Impact:** These roadmap changes mean scope split: The PM goes to backlog after the meeting and splits the epic Feature Y into two: "Feature Y core (beta)" and "Feature Y enhancements". They prioritize core items higher for Q3 sprints. The less critical parts move under enhancements for Q4. They adjust estimates and capacity accordingly (ensuring Q3 workload is feasible). The Resource module shows Q3 now heavier for devs; the EM sees they're near capacity but manageable with some overtime or deferring a minor feature. A minor feature Z is deferred to next year (the PM moves that epic's bar from Q4 to Q1 next year on roadmap and backlog items similarly rescheduled).
4. **Communication:** The PM publishes an updated external roadmap (via PDF or portal) that now promises "Feature Y Beta – Q3 2025" to customers. Sales communicates to the big customer accordingly. Internal team is alerted via EPMT notifications that roadmap changed (perhaps a notification "Roadmap updated: Feature Y now split into Beta and Enhancements").
5. **Execution:** The team then works to deliver the Beta in Q3. Because the roadmap was adjusted with stakeholder input, expectations are managed and the key customer is kept satisfied with an earlier beta, albeit with narrower scope.

_Result:_ The roadmap served as a living plan that could be quickly altered in response to stakeholder needs. EPMT ensured that this change propagated to backlog and capacity plans, preventing an unrealistic ask (they adjusted scope rather than simply pulling in timeline). Everyone from execs to devs stayed aligned with the new plan thanks to the shared source of truth.

### Workflow 4: Integration-Driven Insights and Actions

1. **Customer Feedback Insight:** Over a quarter, the Feedback module collected 30 comments complaining "The app logs me out too often". The PM hadn't created an idea for this (thinking it's minor), but now frequency is high. In EPMT, they search feedback for "log out" and see many entries across different customers all negative. Realizing this is impacting UX, the PM turns this into an action: they create a backlog item "Extend session timeout or provide Remember Me option," linking all those feedback entries to it (so stakeholders know it's addressing 30 complaints).
2. **Prioritization of that Issue:** They slot this improvement into the next sprint because of the volume of complaints (though it wasn't originally on roadmap). The backlog item notes "driven by user feedback (30 requests)". They inform the team in planning, and devs implement it quickly.
3. **Release & Outcome:** The fix (longer sessions) goes out in a patch release. The next month, the PM checks Feedback analytics: the complaints about logouts have dropped to zero. The Release Analytics for that patch shows "Support tickets about session logout: was 15 per month, now 0". NPS might tick up slightly. The PM presents this at a meeting as an example of how listening to user feedback improved satisfaction (closing that feedback loop).
4. **Recurring Bug Monitoring:** Similarly, the bug integration shows a certain bug category "report generation error" keeps reopening each release (maybe there's an underlying platform issue). The PM uses EPMT analytics to see "Bug #234 reopened 3 times this year". They escalate it to engineering management to do a deeper overhaul. They create an epic*Result:* By catching such patterns via integrated data, the product team proactively addresses quality issues that might not be obvious from individual incidents. This demonstrates how EPMT’s integrated view (feedback + bugs + analytics) leads to informed decisions and continuous product improvement.

---

These example workflows demonstrate how EPMT facilitates a seamless, iterative product development process:

- **Ideation to Execution:** Capturing an idea, breaking it down, delivering it, and then evaluating its success (Workflow 1) – all within one system – ensures accountability and learning at every step.
- **Fast-track Critical Issues:** The tight integration of support and development workflows (Workflow 2) shows how EPMT can speed up reaction to problems, minimizing user pain.
- **Dynamic Planning:** The ability to adjust roadmaps and plans in real-time (Workflow 3) with full visibility into consequences prevents over-commitment and keeps stakeholders aligned even as priorities shift.
- **Data-Driven Improvement:** Consolidating feedback and bug data (Workflow 4) enables the team to spot systemic issues or popular requests and act on them, closing the loop with evidence that the action had the desired effect.

Overall, these workflows highlight EPMT’s role as an **end-to-end product management hub** – from capturing the voice of the customer to planning work, coordinating team efforts, and measuring outcomes – thereby driving a more responsive and effective product development practice. Each step is linked with modules (Ideas, Backlog, Roadmap, Resources, Feedback, Analytics) described in previous sections, illustrating how the requirements come together in practical usage. The system supports not just the **mechanics** of product management but also the **communication and insight** that are crucial in an enterprise environment (e.g., keeping all stakeholders informed, justifying decisions with data, and ensuring the product strategy stays on track).

## System Architecture and Design

EPMT’s architecture is designed to be **modular, scalable, and secure**, supporting the various modules and integrations described, while accommodating enterprise demands (like multi-tenancy, high availability, and data protection). Below is an overview of the system's high-level architecture and key components:

**1. Client Applications:**

- **Web Client:** A responsive web application (HTML5/JavaScript) built perhaps with a modern framework (React/Angular/Vue) that communicates with the server via REST/JSON or GraphQL APIs. This is the primary interface for end-users (PMs, devs, stakeholders). It implements rich interactive components: drag-and-drop (for backlog ordering and roadmap scheduling), real-time updates (via WebSockets for notifications or collaborative editing), and local caching for performance (perhaps using state management to avoid excessive calls).
- **Mobile Access:** While a dedicated mobile app is not in initial scope, the web client will be mobile-friendly for viewing dashboards or quick input (especially Idea portal for external use). Push notifications could be enabled via the mobile browser or integration with email/Slack for alerts.

**2. Server-Side Application (API Layer):**

- Built likely as a RESTful API service (could be Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Ruby (Rails) or Java (Spring) – technology to be decided). It enforces business logic and security. Key services/modules on the server:

  - **Authentication & Authorization Service:** Handles user login (with support for SSO via SAML/OAuth), token issuance, password management (if not SSO), and role-based permission checks for every API call. Uses secure protocols (TLS, hashed passwords or SSO tokens). Possibly integrates with enterprise IdPs (like Azure AD) for SSO. Also manages tenant organization data (ensuring data partitioning by tenant).
  - **Idea Management Service:** Endpoints for idea creation, voting, commenting, status changes. Contains logic to prevent duplicate votes, send notifications on status updates, and link ideas to backlog items (if promoted). Connects to the Notification service to inform subscribers.
  - **Backlog & Sprint Service:** Endpoints for CRUD on backlog items, epics, sprints. Enforces ordering logic (perhaps storing an ordering index). Contains business rules (e.g., cannot delete an epic with active stories unless confirmed). Might implement an algorithm for suggestions (like prioritization frameworks or capacity suggestions) or delegate heavy calc to a background worker. Communicates with integration service for syncing with external dev tools (e.g., if backlog item changes assignee, call Jira API).
  - **Roadmap Service:** Endpoints for roadmap items (CRUD of timeline bars/milestones). Handles date calculations and consistency (e.g., ensure an item end date is >= start date). When a roadmap item linked to an epic is edited, it updates the epic (for instance, setting all child backlog items' target release or sprint if date moved, or updating a "release date" field on an epic). Vice versa, if backlog epics statuses update to done, this service might update % complete on roadmap. Also includes logic to filter for different views (internal vs external).
  - **Resource Management Service:** Endpoints to get and update team members, capacity, and assignments. It aggregates data from backlog (assignments & estimates) to produce capacity calculations (maybe on-the-fly or cached). Contains logic for allocation suggestions (e.g., an endpoint `GET /suggestAssignee?taskId=X` returns a list of suggested users ranked by availability and skill). Might use a simple rule engine or query (matching required skill tags to user skill tags and checking a precomputed load).
  - **Feedback & Integration Service:** This is a crucial connector module:

    - It handles webhooks or polling from external systems (support, analytics, bug tracker). Possibly implemented as separate sub-processes or workers for each integration to avoid latency on main thread.
    - For example, a Zendesk webhook hits an endpoint here, this service authenticates it and creates a Feedback entry via the Idea/Feedback service.
    - Also provides internal API for the application to fetch combined feedback/bug data (like queries that join feedback and idea or bug and backlog).
    - Stores integration credentials securely (e.g., encrypted in DB or in a secure vault). Ensures only relevant data is pulled (filtering by project or tags).
    - Might push data to external systems as well (like sending status updates back).
    - Also handles analytics API calls (could be scheduled jobs that call Google Analytics API to fetch usage stats for features – might be in a background worker rather than synchronous API call due to latency).

  - **Analytics & Reporting Service:** Endpoints for release analytics data. It might query the data warehouse (or internal DB tables where metrics are stored) to return metrics for the UI. If metrics are fed externally, this might simply retrieve records. If a calculation is needed (like % change), it computes that. Could leverage a library for chart data prep.
  - **Notification & Email Service:** Central service to send notifications (in-app via WebSocket, emails via SMTP or API like SendGrid). The various modules will call this with events (e.g., idea status changed triggers an event consumed by this service which then looks up subscribers and sends appropriate notifications). Also possibly integrates with Slack/Teams webhooks if enterprise wants alerts there (especially for certain events like a critical bug reported might alert a Slack channel). Ensures compliance (like not spamming, respecting user notification preferences).
  - **Audit Logging Service:** Logs changes for audit in a secure store. E.g., record when a user changes a backlog priority or deletes a comment. This might simply write to an Audit table or log file with timestamp, user, action, entity. Useful for compliance and debugging.

  The server is stateless regarding user sessions (beyond the token), so it can scale horizontally. It may maintain caches (like in-memory or Redis for quick lookup of vote counts, etc., to reduce DB load).

**3. Database & Storage:**

- **Primary Database:** Likely a relational DB (PostgreSQL or MySQL) to store structured data:

  - Tenants, Users, Roles
  - Ideas (table for ideas), IdeaVotes (link table user->idea), IdeaComments
  - BacklogItems (fields: id, title, description, type, status, priority, epic_id, sprint_id, release_id, estimate, assignee_id, etc.), Epics (with links to children), Sprints, Releases
  - RoadmapItems (fields: id, name, lane, start_date, end_date, percent_complete, linked_epic_id, status, visibility, etc.), Milestones
  - FeedbackEntries (id, source, external_id, content, user_info, sentiment, status, linked_idea_id, linked_bug_id, etc.)
  - BugRecords (if not integrated entirely with external, but maybe store some minimal record linking to external issue IDs and status for internal tracking)
  - Metrics (maybe a table for release metrics: release_id, metric_name, baseline_value, actual_value, goal_value)
  - Perhaps a Tag or Label table for skills, idea categories, etc., and join tables for linking tags to users, ideas, backlog items.
  - AuditLogs, Notifications, Integration settings, etc.

  Ensure multi-tenant separation either via a tenant_id column on tables (with indexes) or separate schema per tenant. We will likely use a tenant_id on each relevant table and ensure all queries filter by it (with the auth layer injecting that filter based on the logged-in user’s tenant context).

- **Search Index:** For searching text in ideas, feedback, etc., might use PostgreSQL full-text or an external search engine (ElasticSearch). Given need to search within comments and descriptions, an external search service could be beneficial for performance. It could be updated asynchronously as new data comes in.

- **Cache:** A Redis or similar in-memory cache could be used:

  - Caching frequent queries (like backlog list for a project, top ideas list, etc.) to speed up UI.
  - Storing session data if needed (though JWT stateless auth might avoid sessions).
  - Pub/Sub for real-time notifications (or use WebSocket server).

- **File Storage:** For attachments (users might attach screenshot to an idea or bug). Use a cloud storage (AWS S3, etc.). The system stores file metadata (URL, owner, linked entity) in DB and actual file in S3. Ensure access control (signed URLs or proxy through server checking auth to serve file).

- **Data Warehouse (Optional):** If heavy analytics integration, possibly an internal small warehouse table to store aggregated metrics fetched from external sources, for quick queries. E.g., store daily active user counts by date and release version to plot trends. This could be as simple as a metrics table with (date, metric, value, tenant) loaded from CSV or API.

**4. Integration Connectors:**

- Possibly implemented as background workers (which could be separate processes or scheduled tasks using something like Celery (Python) or Bull (Node) or Sidekiq (Ruby)):

  - **Support Connector:** e.g., listens to Zendesk webhooks (so running an HTTP endpoint integrated in main app or separate small service that pushes into a queue).
  - **Jira Connector:** Possibly a periodic job that polls Jira for new/updated issues (if webhooks not used). Alternatively, use Jira webhooks -> our API endpoint. Similarly for other bug trackers. Must handle rate limits and network issues robustly (with retries, etc.).
  - **Analytics Connector:** e.g., a daily job that fetches yesterday’s key metrics from Google Analytics (using their API and storing results). Or if using Segment, maybe events are forwarded to us directly (less likely, better to query aggregates).
  - **CRM Connector:** If needed to link customer data (maybe for feedback linking to revenue), could fetch account info from Salesforce. This is possibly future, but architecture should allow adding new connectors relatively easily via the Integration service with minimal changes to core.

  Use message queue to decouple these from main request cycle. E.g., a Zendesk webhook comes in -> our server quickly enqueues a "processTicket" job -> respond 200 to webhook. The worker then processes and calls our Idea/Feedback service to create entry. This prevents external systems from slowing our main app and allows retry on failure internally.

**5. Security & Compliance:**

- **Multi-Tenancy:** Strict data isolation by tenant. The API layer checks the authenticated user's tenant and scopes every DB query. Possibly use an ORM that supports tenant filters or enforce via middleware.
- **Encryption:** All traffic over TLS. Sensitive fields (like integration API tokens, user passwords) encrypted at rest (or at least hashed in case of passwords). Optionally encrypt feedback content if it might contain sensitive user data (but that might hamper search – likely not encrypted but stored securely with access controls).
- **Audit & Logging:** Keep audit logs (as mentioned) for key changes (could be needed for ISO compliance). Also maintain system logs for error monitoring (integrate with monitoring like Sentry for the app itself).
- **Performance & Scaling:** Each module should scale horizontally. For example, if backlog usage grows, can run multiple app instances behind a load balancer. The DB might need read replicas if lots of read queries (like many view-only users on roadmaps). Partition heavy data if needed (maybe separate analytic data store vs transactional store).
- **Availability:** Aim for high availability with clustering where needed. Use cloud-managed DB with failover, multiple app servers across zones. Possibly containerize and orchestrate (Kubernetes) for ease of scaling and resilience.
- **Compliance:** The architecture should allow data export for a tenant (e.g., an admin can export all their data via an API or admin UI – perhaps not in MVP, but data structure should make that possible).
- **Backup & Recovery:** Regular backups of database and file storage. Possibly point-in-time recovery for DB. For SaaS offering, each tenant’s data could be included in common backups but logically separated if need to restore one (maybe easier to restore whole cluster and then filter).
- **Integration Security:** Use OAuth tokens or API keys securely. For example, connect to Jira via OAuth 2.0 – store refresh token encrypted, refresh as needed. Provide a way to reauthorize if token expires. Ensure scopes are limited (e.g., only access one Jira project).
- **Extensibility:** Architecture should allow adding new modules or integration without massive changes – e.g., microservice approach or plugin architecture. Possibly consider a plugin system for new integration: e.g., if a new tool is to be integrated, drop in a new worker that uses the Integration service’s hooks.

**6. Diagrammatic Summary (Hypothetical):**

- **Clients**: Browser (PMs, Devs, Stakeholders) -> communicates via HTTPS to -> **API Gateway/Load Balancer** -> **Application Servers (stateless)**.
- **Application Servers** host modules: Idea Service, Backlog Service, etc., often just one codebase but logically separated layers, connected to:
- **Database** (PostgreSQL) for main data.
- **Cache** (Redis) for sessions, caches, pub/sub to WebSocket server for notifications.
- **WebSocket Server** (could be same app or separate) to push notifications (like "new comment" or "priority changed" to connected clients).
- **Integration Workers** (could be separate pods/containers) that handle third-party interactions:

  - They read/write from DB as needed (via internal APIs or direct DB access with appropriate models).
  - They use **External APIs**: Zendesk API, Jira API, Google Analytics API, etc.

- **File Storage**: Amazon S3 (with a service or direct upload from client with signed URL, and retrieval via signed URL or proxy through app).
- **Monitoring**: e.g., a service like Sentry or New Relic integrated for error logging and performance monitoring, feeding alerts to devops.

_(We would include an architecture diagram here if this were a visual document, showing the components and integrations with lines connecting EPMT to external systems and databases.)_

This architecture ensures that the system can handle the workflows described:

- When a support tag happens, the Integration Worker via the API creates a feedback item in DB which the Idea service picks up for PM UI.
- When a PM changes a backlog item, the Application Server updates DB and also enqueues a message for Jira integration worker to update Jira, and also notifies via WebSocket to any UI showing that backlog.
- Release analytics data flows in via scheduled jobs calling external analytics and storing results in DB which the Analytics service then serves to the UI.

It is **scalable** (because each part can be scaled independently – more app servers for more users, more workers if integration load high, DB can scale reads with replicas), **secure** (RBAC enforcement, data isolation, encryption), and **flexible** to integrate with various third-party enterprise tools (via the Integration service design). This aligns with enterprise architecture best practices and ensures that as usage grows or new requirements (like additional tool integration or modules) emerge, the system can adapt without fundamental redesign.

**Note:** The actual technical stack can vary (monolithic vs microservices, etc.), but the logical separation above is key. Given the modest initial user base per tenant (a product team of say dozens, external contributors potentially hundreds), a monolithic app with well-defined modules would suffice and simplify initial development, with microservice extraction only if needed for scale or autonomy of teams developing each module. We'll implement robust API boundaries and modular code to ease any future separation.

## Integration & API Requirements

To maximize EPMT’s value in an enterprise environment, robust integration capabilities are essential. The system will expose APIs for integration and support connecting to external tools in a secure, configurable manner. This section outlines specific integration and API requirements beyond what was covered in the feature descriptions:

**1. External Tool Integrations (Recap & Specifics):**

- **Issue Tracking (e.g., Jira):**

  - _Configuration:_ Admins can connect a Jira instance by providing the base URL, project keys to sync, and an API token (or OAuth credentials). They can specify which issue types and statuses map to EPMT backlog. For example, sync all "Bug" and "Task" issues from Project "XYZ".
  - _API usage:_ EPMT will call Jira’s REST API. E.g., GET `/rest/api/3/search?jql=project=XYZ AND statusCategory=New` to fetch new issues. Also subscribe to Jira webhooks if available for instant updates.
  - _Data mapping:_ Fields mapping: Jira "Summary" -> EPMT title, "Description" -> description, "Priority" -> priority/severity, "Assignee" -> match to EPMT user (via email perhaps), "Status" -> EPMT status (with a mapping table), "Issue Key" stored for link-back.
  - _Frequency:_ Near real-time (webhooks) or periodic (e.g., every 5 minutes poll updates). Use incremental sync (store last sync timestamp and fetch issues updated since then).
  - _Conflict resolution:_ If the same field changed in both systems between syncs, server might either overwrite with last modified (timing), or favor one system as source of truth. Perhaps treat Jira as source for bug status, and EPMT as source for priority if PM changes it. We'll document these rules for users.
  - _Test cases:_ Changing an assignee in EPMT triggers PUT to Jira issue; resolving in Jira triggers EPMT mark done.

- **Support Ticket Systems (e.g., Zendesk):**

  - _Configuration:_ Admin enters credentials and selects which tickets to forward (maybe via tags or ticket type). Possibly set up webhook from Zendesk to EPMT's endpoint (preferred).
  - _Data flow:_ On webhook (ticket created/updated with certain tag), EPMT’s endpoint (Integration service) verifies origin (HMAC or token), then uses ticket payload to create a Feedback entry.
  - _Ticket linking:_ Store Zendesk ticket ID in Feedback entry for traceability. Possibly include a link so PM can open the original ticket in Zendesk if needed.
  - _Reply integration:_ If PM marks feedback as resolved or comments on it, optionally send that comment back to Zendesk (maybe as an internal note: "Product team noted this will be addressed in v5.1"). This can be configurable (some may not want auto-updates).
  - _Volume management:_ Potentially many tickets - use criteria to filter important ones to avoid noise, as described in features.

- **Product Analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel):**

  - _Configuration:_ Admin provides credentials or exports data manually. GA might require OAuth token and view ID. Mixpanel might require an API secret or use their data export API.
  - _Data retrieval:_ Could use Google Analytics Reporting API to fetch metrics (like event counts for specific events naming features). Or a Segment integration could push events to EPMT (less likely at first).
  - _Storage:_ Save relevant metrics in the database. E.g., store daily event counts for "Feature X used". Or directly compute aggregates via API each time needed (but better to cache).
  - _Privacy:_ Ensure user-level data is not imported, just aggregated counts, to avoid PII concerns.
  - _Extensibility:_ We might allow admin to define "Metrics of interest" with an API query per metric. E.g., define metric "FeatureX_Usage" as GA event "FeatureX_used". Then EPMT fetches that event count.

- **Communication Tools (Slack/Teams):**

  - _Outgoing:_ Provide an integration where EPMT can send notifications to Slack channels or users. E.g., an admin can set a rule "Post to #product-updates channel when a roadmap milestone is reached or when a release goes live". Use Slack Incoming Webhook or Bot API.
  - _Incoming:_ Possibly allow Slack slash commands to query EPMT. E.g., `/roadmap` could retrieve a summary of upcoming releases. This requires Slack App and processing those commands via EPMT API. Not core, but an enhancement.
  - _Teams:_ Similar approach using Microsoft Teams connectors.

- **Calendar Integration:**

  - _iCal feed:_ For roadmap milestones (like release dates), generate an iCalendar feed URL that users can subscribe to in Outlook/GCal. It would contain events for each milestone (release date, maybe key external roadmap events). This way, stakeholders see product dates on their calendar.
  - _Two-way (if needed):_ Not likely necessary, one-way subscribe is fine.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO) & User Provisioning:**

  - _SSO:_ Support SAML 2.0 and/or OIDC so enterprise users can log in with corporate credentials. Provide metadata for SP, allow admin to configure IdP details. After SSO, map IdP roles or group claims to EPMT roles if possible (or just default everyone to a base role then admin adjusts).
  - _Provisioning:_ Possibly support SCIM for automatic provisioning/deprovisioning of users (so when a user is added to the company's product team group, they appear in EPMT with correct role). This is complex for MVP; manual user invite or bulk import might suffice initially.
  - _API Tokens:_ Provide personal API tokens or OAuth for integrating with custom scripts or tools the enterprise might build (e.g., a script to pull idea data into their data warehouse). Admin can generate tokens for service accounts with specific privileges. Ensure tokens can be revoked.

- **REST API for EPMT (External):**

  - EPMT should have a documented REST API for key resources so enterprises can integrate it into their workflows:

    - _Ideas API:_ e.g., `GET /api/v1/ideas` (with filters for status, category) to retrieve ideas, `POST /api/v1/ideas` to submit an idea (maybe used to integrate with an existing portal or mobile app).
    - _Backlog API:_ e.g., endpoints to get backlog items, update status, etc., for integration with external reporting or automation (though dev tools integration covers team needs, an external PMO tool might want to fetch backlog status).
    - _Roadmap API:_ e.g., `GET /api/v1/roadmap?range=next6months` to get roadmap items; could be used to create custom presentations or sync with portfolio management.
    - _Feedback API:_ for external systems to push feedback if webhooks not used (e.g., a custom script could call `POST /api/v1/feedback` with a message).
    - _Release Analytics API:_ to fetch metrics programmatically if needed for a report (or to push metrics in, as said).

  - The API should use standard auth (either OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens or an API key tied to a user account with permissions).
  - Use rate limiting to prevent abuse. Also, APIs should obey the same permissions (can't fetch others’ data, etc.).
  - Document the API clearly (using OpenAPI/Swagger) so clients can easily adopt it.
  - Possibly make the API public for external idea submission (if a company wants to allow idea creation from their own interface, they can call our API).

- **Webhooks (Outgoing from EPMT):**

  - Offer optional webhooks for certain events so enterprise systems can listen. E.g., a webhook for "Idea status changed" or "Release published". Admin can configure a URL and select events. This way, if the enterprise has an internal system wanting to capture these events, it can. Webhooks would include event type, relevant IDs, and perhaps a short payload or require a follow-up API call to get details for security.

**2. Security & Compliance for Integrations:**

- **OAuth Tokens & API Keys:** These are stored encrypted in the database. Access to them is restricted to the integration service when needed. Regular admins can't read the raw token once stored (they can re-enter or revoke).
- **Audit:** All integration access can be logged (like "Pulled 50 issues from Jira at 10:00, took 2s, X issues new or updated"). Admins might not see that routinely, but for troubleshooting, there should be logs.
- **Permissions Mapping:** Ensure integrated data respects EPMT's permission model. E.g., if a Jira project has issues that not all PMs should see, perhaps treat them as separate products in EPMT's structure. Usually, each integration link will be per product/tenant, so presumably all PMs in that tenant can see the imported bugs/feedback. If finer control needed (like only QA sees bugs, not stakeholders), we rely on roles (stakeholder role might not have access to bug list).
- **Data Consistency & Recovery:** If an external system goes down or token expires, the integration service should handle gracefully (queue data changes if needed, and alert admin to re-auth). If a user inadvertently deletes integrated data on one side, decide how to handle (likely reflect deletion on other side as well to avoid orphan references).
- **Test Integrations:** Provide a "Test Connection" button when setting up an integration that tries a simple fetch (e.g., fetch 1 ticket or issue) to validate credentials and permissions, giving user immediate feedback that config is correct.

**3. Scalability & Future Integrations:**

- The architecture should treat integration points as plug-ins. For example, adding support for another issue tracker (like Azure DevOps) could reuse a similar pattern as Jira integration (just different API endpoints and mapping).
- Possibly use an integration framework or middleware (like a unified interface for external tool connectors, perhaps using something like Zapier integration if not building ourselves, but likely build custom).
- The API-first approach (robust internal and external APIs) ensures that even if EPMT needs to integrate with a homegrown enterprise system, the enterprise can develop against EPMT's API to push/pull data as needed.

**Integration Summary Example:** After setup, when Release 5.0 happens, EPMT might automatically:

- fetch usage stats via API,
- fetch NPS from a survey tool,
- fetch any new bugs reported in the bug tracker,
- compile these in Release Analytics.
  Simultaneously, if a new idea is submitted in EPMT, a webhook could notify an enterprise's Slack channel "New Idea posted by Customer X".
  All these illustrate an integrated ecosystem where EPMT sits at the center but communicates effectively across systems, aligning with enterprise needs for cross-platform workflows.

---

With these integration capabilities, EPMT not only serves as a standalone product management tool but also fits seamlessly into the enterprise software stack. It ensures that _existing tools_ (for dev, support, analytics) continue to be leveraged, while EPMT aggregates and organizes the information from those tools to drive product decisions. The comprehensive API support also future-proofs the solution, making it possible to extend or customize usage as organizations see fit.
