# SaaS Survey Platform – Requirements Document

**Document Purpose:** This comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the features and capabilities of the proposed SaaS Survey Platform. It is intended for the internal product development team to guide design, implementation, and iteration. The document covers all functional requirements (survey creation, distribution, analysis, etc.) and key non-functional requirements (scalability, security, integrations, etc.), organized into clear sections with detailed specifications, examples, and acceptance criteria.

## 1. Overview and Scope

This document specifies a **SaaS Survey Platform** that enables users to design and distribute surveys, collect responses, and analyze results. It targets a wide range of use cases (customer feedback, academic research, employee engagement, market research, etc.) by providing a flexible survey builder with advanced logic, multimedia support, and robust analytics. Key features include an intuitive **Survey Builder** with drag-and-drop editing, a library of **Survey Templates**, support for **Multimedia (images, video, audio)** within surveys, powerful **Analytics** and reporting dashboards, **Email Distribution** tools, **Mobile Compatibility** for respondents, **Multilingual Support** for global surveys, **White-Labeling** for custom branding, **Answer Scoring** for quizzes/assessments, and advanced **Answer Flows** (conditional logic and branching). Additionally, the platform must satisfy non-functional requirements around **Scalability**, **Performance**, **Security** (including data privacy and compliance such as GDPR), **Integration** (APIs and webhooks), and **Administrative Tools** (user roles, permissions, and management dashboards).

**In-Scope Functionality:**

* **Survey Creation Module:** Drag-and-drop survey builder, question types, survey logic (branching, skip logic), survey theming and layout customization, survey version management.
* **Template Library:** Pre-built survey templates for common use cases (with ability to create custom templates).
* **Response Collection & Distribution:** Methods to distribute surveys (email invites, public links, etc.), and ensure surveys are accessible on various devices (responsive design for mobile/web).
* **Multimedia & Rich Content:** Ability to embed images, videos, and audio in surveys to enhance questions.
* **Response Analytics:** Dashboards and reports for survey results, including charts, filters, cross-tabulation, scoring, and export of data.
* **Scoring & Assessments:** Support scoring of responses for quizzes or evaluation surveys, with computed scores and possibly outcome categories.
* **User Management:** Multi-user accounts with roles (admin, editor, viewer, etc.), access control to surveys and data, and an admin console for account configuration.
* **Integration Interfaces:** APIs for external systems to create surveys or fetch results, webhooks for push notifications of new responses, and third-party integrations as needed (e.g. CRM, email marketing).
* **Non-functional Aspects:** System should be secure, scalable to a large number of users and responses, high-performance, maintain data privacy standards, and allow white-label branding for enterprise customers.

**Out of Scope (for this document):** Detailed marketing website features, pricing and billing modules, non-survey features (like general CRM functionality), or any specific UI design mockups (the focus here is on functional requirements and system behavior rather than visual design).

## 2. Definitions and Terminology

* **Survey:** A collection of questions presented to respondents to collect data.
* **Survey Builder:** The interface/tool used by users to create and design surveys (questions, pages, logic, etc.).
* **Respondent:** An end-user who takes a survey and provides responses.
* **Survey Template:** A pre-designed survey questionnaire that users can start from, often tailored to a specific domain or use case.
* **Question Type:** A format of question (e.g. multiple-choice, rating scale, text input) that dictates how respondents provide an answer.
* **Skip Logic / Branching:** Conditional rules that change the survey flow based on respondent answers (sometimes called “Answer Flows” or “routing logic”).
* **White-Labeling:** Customizing the platform’s appearance (and URL/domain) to reflect the customer’s brand, removing the SaaS provider’s branding.
* **Analytics Dashboard:** The component of the platform that visualizes collected response data with charts, statistics, and filters.
* **Webhook:** A real-time notification (HTTP callback) sent from our platform to an external system when certain events occur (e.g. a new survey response is submitted).
* **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of HTTP endpoints that allow external systems or client software to programmatically interact with the platform (e.g. to create surveys or retrieve data).

*(Additional definitions omitted for brevity; standard terms like GDPR, TLS encryption, etc., are assumed to be understood by the product team.)*

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Survey Builder

The platform shall provide a **Survey Builder** that enables users to create and design surveys easily without coding. The builder must be intuitive, employing a **drag-and-drop interface** for adding and arranging elements (questions, text blocks, pages). It should support a wide variety of question types and allow rich customization of the survey’s layout and appearance.

**Key Features & Requirements:**

* **Drag-and-Drop Editor:** Users can add new questions or other elements by dragging them from a toolbox/palette onto the survey canvas. They can rearrange questions or sections by dragging to reorder. This interface should be highly responsive and WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) to preview survey layout in real time. For example, to add a question, the user selects a question type from a menu (on a sidebar) and drags it to the desired position in the survey flow. The system should instantly render the question in the survey design area.

* **Question Types Library:** The builder must support **multiple question types** (at least 15+ common types, extensible to more). These include:

  * *Single-Choice (Single Select):* Respondent selects **one option** from a list (rendered as radio buttons or a dropdown menu). The interface should allow toggling between different single-choice display styles (e.g. radio list vs. dropdown vs. button selection vs. star rating for Likert scale).
  * *Multiple-Choice (Multi Select):* Respondent can choose **one or more options** from a list (rendered as checkboxes, multi-select list, or toggle buttons). The system should handle validation if a maximum or exact number of choices must be selected.
  * *Rating Scale:* A Likert-style question where an opinion scale is presented (e.g., 1 to 5 stars, or labeled options from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”). Could be implemented either as a single-choice special case (with star icons) or using a *Matrix* question (see below) for multiple statements.
  * *Matrix / Table:* A grid of related questions (rows) with a shared set of answer options (columns). For example, a matrix of satisfaction ratings for multiple aspects. The builder should support single-select matrices (one answer per row) and multi-select matrices if needed (checkboxes in grid). Users can add or import multiple rows/columns easily, and optionally allow “Not Applicable” or other exclusive options.
  * *Ranking:* Respondent ranks a list of items in order. The UI can allow dragging items up/down or into a ranked order. The system records the order of items. Support for both **drag-and-drop ranking** and possibly rank by numeric entry.
  * *Open-ended Text:* Two subtypes:

    * **Short Text** (single-line input) for short answers like names or one-word responses. The system should allow setting a character limit or validation pattern (e.g. email format, using regex presets).
    * **Long Text** (multi-line comments) for paragraph responses. Support an optional character limit and possibly a word counter. (Value-add: a feature like “Smart Probe” to encourage detail for short answers could be considered.)
  * *Numeric Input:* A field specifically for numbers or quantities, optionally with validation (integers only, range limits).
  * *Date/Time Picker:* A question for dates or date-time selection, with a calendar UI or time picker, storing a normalized date/time value.
  * *Yes/No (Single Checkbox):* A single checkbox input for a binary yes/no question (often rendered as a checkbox or toggle switch).
  * *File Upload:* Allow respondents to upload a file as an answer (for example, uploading a photo or document). The system should define allowed file types (e.g. images: jpg, png, gif; pdf; docx, etc.) and a max file size. Uploaded files must be stored securely.
  * *Descriptive Text / Section Break:* Not a question, but a content element – for adding explanatory text, instructions, or section headers within the survey. This allows survey creators to provide context or formatting (support basic rich text or HTML embedding for links).
  * *Image Display:* An element to insert an image within the survey (not a question). Useful for including diagrams or branding inside the questionnaire. The builder should let the user upload an image or provide an image URL, and then place the image at full width or a specified size.
  * *(Optional/Advanced)* **Signature** or **Drawing** question: if needed for certain forms (capture a drawn signature). (This can be prioritized lower or as a future addition.)

* **Question Configuration and Options:** For each question added, the builder provides a properties panel to configure its text, help text, answer choices, validation rules, required/optional setting, branching logic triggers (if any), scoring (if enabled), etc. For example, in a multiple-choice question, the user can enter the list of choices, mark some choices as **correct** (for quizzes) or assign points (see Answer Scoring), or tag certain choices as triggering skip logic (see Answer Flows).

* **Survey Layout & Pages:** The builder should allow dividing the survey into pages. Users can insert **page breaks** to group questions on separate pages, which helps manage long surveys and is required for skip logic (skip logic typically moves between pages). The interface should show page divisions clearly and allow dragging questions between pages. Additionally, the builder should allow adding a **welcome page** (intro screen) and a **thank-you page** (completion screen) with customizable text. Page titles or descriptions can be edited as needed.

* **Themes and Branding in Builder:** Provide options to customize the **survey appearance** (colors, font, logo). The survey creator can choose a theme or set specific styles: e.g., header background color, progress bar style, fonts for questions, etc. This can be done via preset themes or a custom theme editor. Ensuring that the survey can match the organization’s branding is crucial. (Note: Full white-labeling including custom domain and removal of platform footer is described in section 3.8 White-Labeling.)

* **Preview Mode:** The builder must offer a **survey preview** feature. Users can preview the survey as it would appear to respondents (in different device views if possible: desktop, tablet, mobile). Preview mode should support testing the logic (skips, scoring) without saving data as real responses.

* **Save and Versioning:** Creators can save a survey draft at any time. The system should autosave periodically to prevent loss of work. It should also maintain version history for surveys (especially once a survey is active, changes may require capturing a new version). If editing an active survey, warn the user about implications (e.g., data consistency issues if questions are removed or changed). Possibly restrict certain edits once responses are collected (for instance, not allowing deletion of a question that already has answers without a strong warning).

* **Collaboration:** (If in scope) The platform can allow multiple team members to collaborate on survey design. This might mean multiple authors can access the survey in builder (likely not simultaneously editing in real-time unless we implement live collaboration). At minimum, support sharing a survey with other users with edit or comment rights. For example, a user can invite a colleague to review the survey design, who can add comments or suggestions within the builder UI (comment functionality). *(Collaboration is a desirable feature but not strictly required in v1; could be a later iteration.)*

**Supported Question Types Table:** (Summary of main question formats)

| **Question Type**              | **Description & Behavior**                                                                                                                                              | **Example Use**                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-Choice (Single Select)  | One answer choice allowed (Radio buttons or dropdown list). Supports mutually exclusive options. E.g., choosing one preferred product.                                  | “Which one of these is your primary device?”                                                   |
| Multiple-Choice (Multi Select) | Multiple answers allowed (Checkboxes). Use for “Select all that apply.” The platform should handle if too many or too few selections (optionally configurable).         | “Which of these features do you use? (Select all that apply)”                                  |
| Rating Scale (Likert or Stars) | Measure level of agreement or satisfaction on a scale. Could be 1-5 stars or a 1-7 agreement scale labeled per option. Often displayed horizontally.                    | “Rate your satisfaction with the service (1 = Very Dissatisfied, 5 = Very Satisfied)”          |
| Matrix (Grid)                  | A table of related single- or multi-select questions sharing the same options scale. Each row is a statement, each column is a rating. Can also support checkbox grids. | “Please rate your agreement with the following statements (rows) on a scale of 1-5 (columns).” |
| Ranking                        | Respondent arranges items in order of preference or importance. Typically implemented via drag-and-drop sorting.                                                        | “Rank the following 5 features from most to least important to you.”                           |
| Short Text Input               | Single-line text entry for short answers. Optionally validate format (email, number, etc.).                                                                             | “What is your job title?” (expects a short text)                                               |
| Long Text Input                | Multi-line text box for longer open responses (comments). Can set character limit.                                                                                      | “Any additional feedback or comments?”                                                         |
| Numeric Input                  | Text input specifically for numbers (could be integer or float). Enforce numeric-only and range if needed.                                                              | “How many employees are in your company?”                                                      |
| Date/Time Picker               | Specialized input for dates or date/time. Provide a calendar UI for date selection to ensure format consistency.                                                        | “Select a preferred appointment date:”                                                         |
| Yes/No (Boolean)               | A single checkbox or toggle, representing a yes/no question. Checked = Yes, Unchecked = No (or similar).                                                                | “Do you consent to participate in this survey?”                                                |
| File Upload                    | Allows respondent to upload a file as their answer. Must specify allowed file types and size limit.                                                                     | “Upload your resume” or “Attach a photo of the issue.”                                         |
| Descriptive Text / HTML        | Not a question – used to display instructions or embed rich content (images, videos) within the survey. Does not collect a response.                                    | Section introduction, or embedding an image stimulus followed by a question about it.          |
| Image Display                  | Insert an image (with optional caption) in the survey content.                                                                                                          | Showing a diagram and then asking questions about it.                                          |
| Signature (draw) \[*Optional*] | Captures a drawn signature or doodle on touchscreen or mouse. Saves as image data.                                                                                      | “Please sign below to acknowledge.” (Primarily for forms requiring consent)                    |

*Acceptance Criteria:* The survey builder must allow creating a survey that includes one of each of the above question types, and the preview should show each functioning correctly. The storage model should capture all question definitions (including metadata like required, validation rules, etc.). A non-technical user should be able to construct a complete survey (e.g., 20 questions with various types and logic) within the builder without needing to write any code or scripts.

### 3.2 Survey Templates

To accelerate survey creation and provide guidance to users, the platform will include a library of **Survey Templates**. Templates are pre-built survey questionnaires tailored for common purposes or industries. Users should be able to browse templates, preview them, and start a new survey based on a template (which they can then modify as needed).

**Requirements:**

* **Template Library Access:** In the survey creation flow, users can choose to start from scratch or from a template. The system should present a categorized library of templates. For example, categories might include **Customer Satisfaction**, **Employee Engagement**, **Market Research**, **Education/Academic**, etc.

* **Pre-Built Templates:** Provide a broad selection of professionally designed templates. For instance:

  * **Customer Feedback Surveys:** e.g. Product Satisfaction Survey, Customer Service Feedback.
  * **Employee Surveys:** e.g. Employee Engagement Pulse, 360-Degree Feedback forms.
  * **Market Research:** e.g. Market Product Fit survey, Brand Awareness survey.
  * **Academic/Research:** e.g. Course Evaluation, Academic Research Questionnaire.
  * **Event Surveys:** e.g. Event Registration form, Post-Event Feedback.
  * (At least 20+ templates at launch, covering a variety of use cases. The collection can grow over time.)

  Each template should include a set of questions (with logic if applicable) and default text that is considered a best practice for that scenario. For example, a **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** template would have the standard “How likely are you to recommend \[Company/Product] to a friend or colleague?” question on a 0-10 scale, followed by a comment box.

* **Template Details:** For each template, store metadata such as a template name, description (what it’s for), and tags (for search filtering). Users can search by keyword to find relevant templates (e.g., searching “satisfaction” brings up customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction templates).

* **Using a Template:** When a user chooses a template, the system creates a new survey populated with all questions and logic from that template. The user can then edit it freely (change wording, add/remove questions). The template content serves as a starting point, not locked. Changes to the survey do not affect the original template definition.

* **Creating Custom Templates:** Users with appropriate permissions (e.g., an organization admin or a power user) should be able to save any of their existing surveys as a **custom template** for reuse. This is especially useful for enterprise customers who have standardized survey formats. When saving as template, allow the user to specify which parts are variable (e.g., placeholders for product name). This functionality may be part of a later phase if not at launch.

* **Template Updates:** If we (the platform admins) update the library of provided templates (for example, improving question wording in a default template), it does not automatically change surveys already created from that template. It will only affect new usage of the template. (We may consider versioning templates, but initially, treat them as static starting points.)

* **No Vendor Branding in Templates:** Templates should be generic and not contain any specific platform branding in their content. They exist to help users, not advertise.

*Acceptance Criteria:* The user can navigate to “Create Survey > Templates”, browse template categories, read a template description, and select one to create a new survey. The new survey appears in the builder with all template questions present. The user can then modify a question (e.g., change the wording of a question) and the change is reflected in their survey (without altering the base template for others). If the user saves that survey and later another user uses the same template, they get the original default content, not the first user’s modified version.

### 3.3 Multimedia Support (Images, Videos, Audio)

The survey platform should support embedding **multimedia content** – images, videos, and audio clips – within surveys to create engaging questionnaires. This includes using media as part of questions or as standalone descriptive elements.

**Requirements:**

* **Image Embedding:** Users can insert images into surveys in two contexts:

  1. As part of a question text (e.g., an image with a set of questions about it, or using images as answer choices).
  2. As independent content blocks (descriptive images between questions).

  The builder should allow uploading an image file or linking to an external image URL. Accept common image formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF at minimum. When an image is uploaded, it should be stored in the user’s media library on the platform for reuse if needed. The system can impose a size limit (for example, images up to 5 MB each) to ensure performance.

* **Video Embedding:** Users can embed videos in a survey question or page. This should support videos hosted on popular platforms (YouTube, Vimeo) via embed code or URL. For example, the user can supply a YouTube link and the platform should embed the playable video in the survey. Alternatively, allow uploading short video files (with a size limit such as 16 MB, given storage and compatibility considerations). Supported formats for direct upload might include MP4 (widely supported in browsers). Larger videos should be hosted externally due to bandwidth concerns.

  When a video is embedded, it should appear with controls for play/pause, and not auto-play with sound by default (to avoid startling respondents).

* **Audio Embedding:** Similar to video, support embedding audio clips (e.g., MP3 files or SoundCloud links). This can be useful for surveys where respondents listen to a piece of audio (like a pronunciation in a language test or a music snippet for feedback). If uploading directly, recommend MP3 format for broad compatibility and limit file size (e.g. 5-10 MB). Provide a simple audio player UI with play/pause.

* **Media Playback on All Devices:** Ensure that embedded media is accessible and playable across common devices and browsers. For example, an embedded YouTube video should work on both desktop and mobile browsers. Use HTML5 players. (Note: Qualtrics suggests using host services like YouTube for better device compatibility, which we can also recommend to users, but we will support basic direct uploads for convenience within size limits.)

* **Use Cases:** The platform should accommodate use cases such as:

  * Including a company logo or promotional image at the top of the survey.
  * Showing a concept prototype image and asking users to give feedback.
  * Playing a tutorial video or advertisement within a survey and then asking questions about it.
  * Audio-based quizzes (e.g., “listen to this clip and answer questions”).

* **Question Types with Media:** If possible, allow certain question types to use images as answer choices (e.g., a multiple-choice question where each option is an image instead of text, sometimes called “Image Choice”). This can be handled by letting the user attach an image to each choice in the builder. For example, a question “Which design do you prefer?” with 3 image options that the respondent can click to select. This is an advanced feature; if not at launch, it can be planned for a later update.

* **Storage & Performance:** All uploaded media files should be stored securely (likely in cloud storage). We should generate optimized versions if needed (thumbnails for large images). The survey renderer (the client side) should lazy-load media content to avoid slowing down initial page load (especially for images/videos not on the first page).

* **Accessibility Consideration:** Allow adding **alt text** for images (for screen readers), and providing transcripts or descriptions for audio/video for ADA compliance (this might tie into a broader accessibility requirement section).

* **Media Security:** If surveys are marked as internal or containing sensitive media, we might want to restrict media access (like not publicly accessible URLs unless the survey is being taken). Perhaps media can be behind authenticated URLs if needed, or at least obscure links. For simplicity, we assume survey content is not highly confidential.

*Acceptance Criteria:* In the builder, the user can click “Insert Media” on a question or page, upload an image, and it appears in the design preview. On the respondent side, the image is visible at the intended place and properly scaled. Similarly, the user can embed a YouTube video by URL, and in preview it shows an embedded player. On taking the survey, a respondent can play the video within the survey and then answer the question. Testing should confirm that a sample image, video, and audio file can all be added and function on desktop and mobile. Also, test that if an uploaded video exceeds the size limit, the platform shows a friendly error guiding the user to use a hosting service instead.

### 3.4 Survey Logic and Answer Flows

To create dynamic, personalized surveys, the platform must support **Answer Flows** – i.e., logic that routes respondents through different paths based on their answers. This includes skip logic (jumping to later sections), branching, and display logic (show/hide questions conditionally). Proper logic capabilities ensure that respondents only see relevant questions, improving the survey experience.

**Requirements:**

* **Skip Logic (Question Branching):** The survey creator can configure a question such that the respondent’s answer determines which question or page comes next. For example: “If answer to Q1 is ‘No’, skip to Q5 (bypassing Q2–Q4).” This is typically implemented on a per-question basis for single-choice or dropdown questions (and supported for checkboxes with caution, as multiple selections can have conflicting logic paths). The UI in the builder: When editing a question, user can add logic rules: for each answer option (or for each condition), specify the target page/question to jump to. The logic should allow sending respondent either to a specific later question, to a later page, or to the end of the survey (often used for disqualification logic). We should ensure you cannot configure a jump backwards (that could cause loops) – only forward skipping is allowed.

* **Page Logic / Branches:** Alternatively or additionally, allow designing **branch flows** at the page or survey level. Some platforms have a visual “survey flow” tool where you define branches: e.g., “If Q1 = Yes, then show Page 2; if Q1 = No, skip to Page 3.” This might be represented as a tree diagram of pages. For our initial version, question-level skip logic might suffice. If implemented, ensure that page-level logic and question-level logic coexist without conflict (question logic typically takes precedence in SurveyMonkey, etc., when both are present).

* **Display Logic (Conditional Questions):** Ability to show or hide a question (or entire blocks) based on prior answers or respondent metadata. For example, a follow-up question “Why dissatisfied?” should only display if the user answered “Dissatisfied” to a previous question. In the builder, this could be done by setting a condition on the question “display if \[Question X] answer = ...”. This is essentially the inverse of skip (skip jumps forward, display logic keeps questions hidden unless criteria met). It’s useful when we want to keep the question in the same page flow but only relevant subset see it.

* **Piping and Carry-Forward:** More advanced logic features include **piping** (inserting a previous answer’s text into a subsequent question text or into answer options) and **carry-forward choices** (taking selected options from one question and using them as the options in a later question). For example, Q1 asks “Which of these products have you used? (Select all that apply)” and Q2 then says “Of the products you’ve used, which is your favorite?” and presents only the options the respondent selected in Q1. Implementing carry-forward might be complex; if not in the initial scope, document as a planned enhancement. (SurveyLab notes an improved carry-forward mechanism – we should match competitor capabilities eventually.)

* **Randomization:** The platform should allow randomizing the order of answer options (to reduce order bias) for certain question types, and possibly randomizing question order within a section. Users should be able to enable/disable randomization and optionally **fix the position** of certain choices (e.g., “Other (please specify)” choice should stay at bottom). This requirement may be lower priority but is common in research-oriented surveys.

* **Quota Management:** (Advanced logic, possibly future scope) Ability to set quotas that end the survey or stop collecting certain options once a threshold is met (e.g., collect 100 males and 100 females then close the survey or branch out). This is a complex feature and may be out-of-scope for v1, but note it for completeness.

* **Testing Logic:** Provide a way to test the survey logic. The preview mode should let the survey designer try different paths. We might also include a “logic check” tool that scans for any logic issues (like unreachable questions or conflicts). SurveyMonkey, for example, encourages preview testing of all paths. We should similarly document that the user should test. Optionally, have a simulation mode where the creator can choose answers and see where it goes.

* **Complex Conditions:** The logic engine should support combining conditions (AND/OR). For instance, show question Q5 only if (Q1 = “Yes” **AND** Q2 > 10) **OR** (Q3 contains “ABC”). We should plan to support multiple conditions per branch with AND/OR operators for enterprise-level complexity. If UI complexity is an issue, an advanced “Logic Builder” interface can be provided.

* **Default Flow:** If no logic is specified for a given question or answer, the survey simply goes to the next question in order. If a question has logic that doesn’t cover all answers (e.g., only specific answers cause jumps), ensure the default behavior (usually continue to next in sequence) is clear.

* **Disqualification & Endings:** Provide an easy way to end the survey early based on an answer (e.g., if respondent is not eligible). For example, if first question asks “Are you over 18?” and they answer “No”, skip to end with a message “You must be 18 to participate.” We can implement this via skip logic to an end page or a specific disqualification page. The platform should allow customizing the end page text for disqualifications separately from the normal completion thank-you page.

* **Data Recording:** The logic should not break data collection. Even if a user skips certain questions, their answers to shown questions must be recorded. If a user is disqualified (screened out), mark their response record appropriately (as “disqualified” or “terminated”) versus “complete”. Ensure partial responses have an indicator if logic ended survey early.

**Example Scenario:** A survey has a screening section: Q1: “Do you smoke?” (Yes/No). If “No”, the survey might skip directly to a termination page saying “Thank you, but this survey is for smokers only.” If “Yes”, continue to Q2. Q2 asks “How many cigarettes per day?” (open numeric). If Q2’s answer is more than 0, show Q3: “Have you attempted to quit before?” otherwise if Q2 = 0 (maybe they only smoke socially), perhaps branch to a different set of questions. All these flows should be definable in the builder.

**Citations & References:** Our logic features should match industry standards: e.g., SurveyMonkey’s question skip logic allows jumping to specified pages/questions based on answers, and Qualtrics supports complex branching and display logic for advanced scenarios. The platform should allow similarly powerful configurations in a user-friendly way.

*Acceptance Criteria:* The survey builder must allow a user to implement at least these cases: (a) skip a single question based on a previous question’s answer, (b) skip a whole section (jump from Q1 to Q5), (c) conditionally display a follow-up question based on a prior answer. During testing, create a survey with these logic rules and verify that in preview or a test response, selecting the triggering answers results in the correct next question being shown, and that other answers follow the default sequence. Verify that no inaccessible question remains (unless intentionally hidden behind logic). Also test a disqualification scenario: respondent sees the disqualify message and the response is marked appropriately in results (with only Q1 answered, for example).

### 3.5 Survey Distribution and Email Integration

Creating a survey is only half the battle; distributing it to respondents is equally critical. The platform should provide robust **distribution options**, prominently including an **Email Distribution** system (built-in or via integration) to send survey invitations and track responses. Additionally, it should support other channels (links, social media sharing, maybe SMS in future) to maximize reach.

**Requirements:**

* **Unique Survey Link (Web):** Every survey created will have a unique web URL that can be shared. Respondents can click the link and take the survey. The link should be pretty (e.g., using survey title or a short code, but still obscure enough for privacy). Example: `https://surveyplatform.com/r/CustomerFeedback123`. This link (primary collector) can be used in emails, posted on social, embedded on websites, etc. The platform should automatically generate this and allow the creator to copy it.

* **Email Distribution (Built-in):** The platform will allow survey creators to send email invitations directly. Key functionalities:

  * **Contact Lists:** Users can upload or create contact lists (name + email, possibly other fields like demographics for later use in response metadata). Support importing CSV of contacts.
  * **Email Template:** Users can compose an email invitation: subject, body text (with placeholders for survey link, and possibly respondent name for personalization). Provide a default invitation template (which users can edit) that inserts the survey link.
  * **Sending Emails:** Platform should handle sending the emails to the provided list. This requires a backend email delivery system (possibly integration with an email service provider or using our own SMTP). The system should throttle or batch large sends to avoid being flagged as spam, or integrate with a service that handles bulk email.
  * **Invitation Tracking:** Track which contacts have responded. Ideally, each invitation link is unique per recipient (so we can mark responses as coming from a specific email). Generate unique tokens in links for tracking and to prevent multiple submissions from one invite (unless allowed).
  * **Reminders:** Allow scheduling reminder emails to those who haven’t responded, e.g., “Send a reminder 7 days later to contacts who haven’t completed the survey.”
  * **Bounce Handling:** Keep track of emails that bounce or fail, and inform the user (maybe marking those contacts as invalid).
  * **Opt-Out Compliance:** All emails should include an unsubscribe link or comply with CAN-SPAM requirements. If a contact unsubscribes, we should not email them again from the system.

  *Note:* The built-in email distribution is a complex subsystem; if it’s too large to implement initially, as an interim, we might integrate with external mailing services or instruct users to use their own email with the public link. However, having it integrated is a big value-add for a SaaS survey tool, so it’s strongly desired.

* **Third-Party Email Integration:** Optionally, allow connecting to external email services (like Mailchimp, SendGrid) via API or integration, so users can leverage those for sending invites. This could be a later feature. Initially, perhaps ensure we can send reliably via our platform.

* **Other Distribution Channels:**

  * **Web Link:** As mentioned, the generic link can be copied and pasted anywhere. Ensure surveys can be taken on all modern browsers without login.
  * **Social Media:** Provide quick share buttons to post the survey link to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., with a default snippet (pulling survey title/description).
  * **Embed in Website:** Provide an HTML snippet to embed the survey on a webpage (either as an iframe or using our JS widget). This allows, e.g., embedding the survey into a company’s site or within a blog post.
  * **QR Code:** Generate a QR code for the survey link that can be downloaded and placed on printed materials for easy mobile access.
  * **SMS (Future):** Possibly integrate with SMS providers to send survey links via text message for higher open rates. Not required for initial release but keep in mind.
  * **Kiosk/Offline (Future):** Some platforms allow running a survey in kiosk mode offline (for in-person data collection). Likely out of scope for now, but something to consider later.

* **Mobile Distribution & Compatibility:** This overlaps with mobile compatibility (see section 3.6). If sending via SMS or WhatsApp, ensure the survey link is mobile-friendly. We might consider a mobile app for surveys, but probably not needed if web is responsive.

* **Multiple Collectors:** The platform should support multiple collectors per survey. A collector is a distribution instance – e.g., one survey could have an Email Collector (to a specific list), an Anonymous Link Collector (public web link), etc. This is useful to track where responses came from. Each collector can have its own settings (like each email list is separate, or one requires a password, etc.). For initial version, at least differentiate between the default web link and the email invites.

* **Survey Access Control:** Provide options on who can access the survey:

  * **Open vs Closed:** A survey can be open to anyone with the link, or restricted (by a password or by email token).
  * **One Response per Person:** If using email invitations with unique tokens, system should prevent multiple submissions from one email link by default (unless user explicitly allows multiple).
  * **Anonymous vs Identified:** If using identified invitations, tie responses to contact info. If anonymity is needed, use an anonymous link or do not link personal data.

* **Collector Settings:** Additional settings like:

  * **Response Limit:** e.g., close the survey after 500 responses.
  * **Close Date:** automatically close (deactivate link) after a certain date/time.
  * **Notification:** Option for survey owner to get an email notification each time a new response is received (or daily summary).
  * **Allow Save and Resume:** if survey is long, optionally allow respondents to save progress and resume via a return link.

* **Email Invitation Example:** The system might provide a default message like:

  *Subject:* “You’re invited to participate in our survey”
  *Body:* “Dear {Name},\nWe value your feedback. Please take a few minutes to complete our survey: {Survey Link}\nThank you!”

  The user can modify this. Ensure {Survey Link} is inserted properly (unique to recipient if tracking).

* **Email Deliverability:** The platform should use verified sender domains and include proper headers (DKIM, SPF alignment) to improve deliverability. Possibly allow customers on enterprise plans to use their own email domain for sending (so invites come from [surveys@theircompany.com](mailto:surveys@theircompany.com)). This ties into white-labeling and is advanced (might be post-MVP).

**References:** Competing survey tools offer diverse distribution methods. For example, one survey software highlights “diverse distribution options, including email, SMS, and social media” as a key feature. Our platform should match or exceed these options.

*Acceptance Criteria:* The user can successfully send a survey to themselves or a test list via the email system and verify it arrives in the inbox with a working link. A small pilot of 3-5 recipients yields distinct recorded responses tied to each. Also, the public link should open the survey without requiring login. If the user sets a close date or response cap, testing should show the survey becomes inactive after those conditions (with an appropriate message like “This survey is now closed”). The system should be able to handle at least a mailing list of a few thousand contacts in one go (for MVP – we’ll scale further later). Track open rates and response rates in the UI (nice-to-have: show X emails sent, Y responded).

### 3.6 Mobile Compatibility

Given the prevalence of smartphones, the survey platform **must ensure an excellent mobile experience** for respondents. Surveys need to be fully responsive and functional on mobile devices (phones, tablets), with no loss of functionality. Additionally, the survey-taking interface should be optimized for touch interaction.

**Requirements:**

* **Responsive Design:** All survey pages (the end-user taking interface) should use responsive web design to adapt to various screen sizes. When viewed on a small device (e.g., 360px wide phone), the survey content should reflow vertically, avoid horizontal scrolling, and use legible font sizes and appropriately sized buttons/inputs. For example, matrix questions might stack differently or use scroll within the matrix on mobile. Ensure that multi-column layouts (if any) collapse to single column on narrow screens.

* **Mobile-Aware Survey Themes:** Provide themes/templates that are tested on mobile. Possibly have mobile-specific tweaks (like larger tap targets). According to MaritzCX Survey Builder, every survey created should adapt automatically to smartphones and tablets. We must achieve that level of mobile-aware design: any survey built on the platform will *by default* be mobile-friendly without the creator needing to do anything extra.

* **Touch-Friendly Controls:** Use mobile-friendly form controls. E.g., radio buttons and checkboxes should be easily tappable (sufficient size and spacing). Dropdowns should be native mobile selects or enhanced for better usability. For rating scales, maybe use a touch slider or large star icons on mobile. Drag-and-drop ranking might be harder on mobile; ensure it’s still usable (possibly allow tapping up/down arrows as alternative to drag for rank ordering, or long-press and drag with smooth scrolling).

* **Page Navigation on Mobile:** Ensure that the “Next” and “Back” buttons are easily tap-able and fixed at bottom of viewport if needed (so user doesn’t have to scroll a lot to find “Next”). The progress bar should also be visible and not break layout.

* **Mobile Preview:** In the builder’s preview mode, offer a way to preview how the survey looks on mobile dimensions. Possibly a toggle or simulate phone view.

* **No dependence on hover or other desktop-only interactions:** All survey functionality should be accessible via touch. For instance, if we have any tooltips or hover prompts, they should also appear on tap for mobile users.

* **Mobile Web vs. Native App:** We assume respondents will use mobile web (via link or email). We are not building a native mobile app for survey-taking at this stage; it’s not required if our web is good enough. (However, ensure that if an enterprise wanted to embed a webview of the survey in their app, it works well too.)

* **Offline Capability:** Out of scope for now; assume internet is required while taking the survey. (Offline mode could be considered for a dedicated app or offline collector in the future.)

* **Mobile Email Open:** Many people open email invites on their phone. Ensure that clicking the survey link from a phone email goes straight to a mobile-optimized survey page.

* **Testing on Devices:** Plan to test on popular devices and browsers: e.g., iPhone Safari, Android Chrome, etc. Also test both portrait and landscape orientations.

**Performance on Mobile:** Mobile devices may have slower connections; our survey pages should be lightweight. Avoid heavy scripts; load only necessary components. If multimedia is present, consider letting user choose to load (to save data) — perhaps not needed, but keep mobile data usage in mind.

**Reference:** “Survey Builder uses mobile-aware designs, so every survey you create adapts automatically to smartphones, tablets, and other devices”. Our goal is exactly that: seamless experience irrespective of device.

*Acceptance Criteria:* Create a test survey with a variety of question types and open it on a smartphone. Verify that:

* All text is readable without zoom.
* Buttons and inputs can be used without zooming.
* No elements are cut off or require horizontal scroll.
* Logic works on mobile as it does on desktop.
* Submit a complete response via mobile successfully.
  Also, run Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test or similar on a survey link to ensure it passes as mobile-friendly. Any critical issues (like clickable elements too close, text too small) should be resolved. The team should maintain a checklist of UI components to verify on mobile after any significant UI updates.

### 3.7 Multilingual Support

The platform should support creating and deploying surveys in multiple languages to reach a global audience. **Multilingual Support** entails both the ability for survey designers to provide translations for all survey content, and for respondents to easily switch to their preferred language when taking the survey.

**Requirements:**

* **Multiple Languages per Survey:** A single survey can have several language versions (e.g., English, Spanish, French, Chinese, etc.). The survey creator should be able to enter translations for the survey content:

  * Questions and answer choices.
  * Intro/welcome text.
  * Outro/thank-you text.
  * Any error messages or button text that the respondent sees (like “Next”, “Previous”, “Submit”) should either be automatically translated or configurable.

* **Default Language & Additional Translations:** The creator will design the survey initially in a primary language (say English). They can then enable additional languages. For each enabled language, the UI should list each survey element with a field to input the translated text. This could be in a side-by-side table for efficiency or a form that iterates through each element. The platform should not auto-translate (to avoid inaccuracies), but we might consider integration with translation services in future (maybe offer a “machine translate” as a starting point with caution).

* **Language Selector for Respondents:** When a respondent accesses a multilingual survey (via a generic link), the survey should detect or ask for language:

  * If we can detect browser language and if that language is available, we could default to it (with an option to change).
  * Alternatively, show a language selection dropdown at the start (first page) so the user picks their preferred language. This could be automated by the system: when multiple languages are configured, the platform inserts a language selection step at the beginning.
  * The language selector should list the available languages in their own name (e.g., “Español”, “Français”).
  * Once selected, all survey content switches to that language. (Ensure that changing language mid-way is not allowed or at least warns that answers will be reset, since mixing languages mid-response could complicate data.)

* **Invitation Language Handling:** If email invitations are used, ideally the invitation can be sent in the recipient’s language. This implies we might need to store preferred language per contact. A possible flow: the user uploads contacts with a “Language” field. We send invites with a link that includes a parameter or token that pre-selects the language, or we send different collector links per language group. (This is a complex area; initially, we may assume a survey is mostly distributed in one language at a time, or use the selector. Later, implement multi-language email invites using separate contact lists per language.)

* **Data Storage:** All responses, regardless of language, should map to the same underlying questions. In the results, it might be useful to know which language the respondent took the survey in (we can store the language as a field in the response metadata). When viewing results, combine responses from all languages for analysis by default, but allow filtering by language if needed (to compare results by language or region).

* **UI Translation:** Ensure the platform’s survey-taking interface can display various character sets (UTF-8 support). This includes support for non-Latin scripts (Chinese, Arabic, Cyrillic, etc.) and right-to-left (RTL) layout for languages like Arabic or Hebrew:

  * For RTL languages, the survey rendering should adjust direction (we may rely on a `dir="rtl"` attribute when language is set to an RTL one).
  * Buttons and progress bars should also adjust placement if needed for RTL.

* **Localization of Dates/Numbers:** If any question or display uses dates or numeric formats, localize them (e.g., date pickers showing Monday first vs Sunday, decimal commas vs points if showing any numbers). However, since we mostly collect text or raw data, this might not be a big issue. But e.g., in an email invitation for French, use DD/MM format if referencing dates.

* **Validation and Error Messages:** Provide default translations of common validation messages (“This question is required”, “Please enter a valid email”) for each supported language so that respondents see errors in their chosen language. The platform should supply these or allow the survey designer to override them.

* **Advanced:** Possibly allow different survey flow by language (not likely; usually the survey content is the same, just translated). We will assume structure is identical across translations.

**Reference:** The MaritzCX Survey Builder mentions “advanced localization services, so you can reach out to your customers and conduct surveys in their preferred language”, highlighting the need for our platform to offer equivalent capabilities. Also, our builder’s translation interface should be user-friendly – Qualtrics and others have a “Translate Survey” mode that lists each string.

*Acceptance Criteria:* A survey creator can create a survey in English, then add Spanish as a second language. They input Spanish translations for all questions. When the survey is published, accessing the link either auto-detects Spanish (if browser is Spanish and we implement that) or presents a language picker. If the respondent chooses Español, all text appears in Spanish. Submitting a response in Spanish still records under the same question IDs as English responses. In the analysis UI, the team can see responses combined, and potentially filter by language. Additionally, test that an RTL language (like Arabic) displays correctly: add Arabic to a survey, input translations (we may need to copy some sample Arabic text), preview the survey in Arabic and confirm that text is right-aligned and flows RTL properly, and that the experience is smooth. Lastly, ensure that if a required question is left blank in Spanish mode, the error comes up in Spanish (e.g., “Esta pregunta es obligatoria.” if we have that translated).

### 3.8 White-Labeling and Branding

For enterprise clients or those embedding surveys in their own product, the platform should offer **White-Labeling** features. This means the survey (and possibly the survey management interface) can be branded to look like it’s entirely the client’s product, with minimal or no mention of the SaaS provider. Full branding control enhances professionalism and trust.

**Requirements:**

* **Custom Branding on Surveys:** Users (particularly on premium plans) should be able to customize the look & feel of the survey to match their brand identity. This includes:

  * **Logo:** Upload a company logo to appear on the survey (e.g., top of the page or as a background watermark).
  * **Colors and Fonts:** Set primary and secondary colors that apply to the survey background, question text, buttons, progress bar, etc. Choose font styles (from web-safe or Google Fonts).
  * **Custom CSS (Advanced):** Optionally allow injection of custom CSS for fine-tuning (this might be advanced/for enterprise).
  * **Remove Platform Name:** The default footer or any “Powered by SurveyPlatform” label on the survey should be removable for white-label users.
  * **Custom Domain for Survey Links:** Instead of `surveyplatform.com`, allow use of a custom domain or subdomain (e.g., surveys.clientcompany.com). This involves DNS setup on the client side. Our system should support serving the survey under that domain. This is a true white-label hallmark.
  * The combination of these means a respondent would not easily know which survey SaaS is being used; it appears as the client’s own survey tool.

* **White-Label in Email Invites:** If using our email system, allow the “From” address to be the client’s email domain (with proper setup) rather than a default platform email. Also, email templates should be fully editable to include client branding, not ours.

* **White-Label in Reports:** If the platform provides PDF exports of results or public dashboards, those should also be brandable (e.g., add client logo, remove our logo). At minimum, allow removing vendor logo from printed reports for those with white-label rights.

* **Multiple Brand Profiles:** If an agency user manages surveys for multiple end clients, they might need multiple branding presets. Initially, we can allow one branding per account. Enterprise tier might have ability to set branding per survey or per workspace.

* **Consistency:** Ensure that the branding customizations do not break the layout (e.g., extremely large logo resizing, or odd color combos still maintain accessibility). Perhaps enforce image size limits or provide guidance.

* **Platform Admin Settings:** White-label features might be restricted to certain subscription levels. The system should only show these options if the user’s account has that feature enabled.

* **Embedded Surveys:** If user embeds a survey in their website via iframe or script, white-label is crucial because the survey should seamlessly blend with site. Provide an “embedded mode” that is minimalistic (maybe no header at all, if the site already provides context).

* **Removing References:** Not just visual branding, but also remove references in text. For example, if default end page says “Thank you for taking this survey on SurveyPlatform”, that should be editable. Also, any links to our privacy policy, etc., might be replaced with the client’s if needed (though that gets tricky legally).

* **Powered by Option:** For non white-label users, we might include a small “powered by X” link. White-label purchase removes it.

* **Sogolytics Example:** Sogolytics advertises features like branded URL, and admin dashboard for user controls – meaning our platform too should allow an admin to manage branding and have control if multiple users are in the org.

**References:**

* “A white-label survey is a customizable survey solution that allows businesses to brand it as their own, with their logos, colors, and design elements.” – Our platform should fulfill this by offering comprehensive branding settings.
* Competitor Zonka Feedback touts “Fully customize and white-label your surveys: add your logo, branding, colors, white-labeled survey link, domain, and more”, which aligns with our goals.

*Acceptance Criteria:* A user on the Enterprise plan can go to a “Branding” settings section, upload their company logo, set primary color to their brand color, set a custom subdomain, and toggle off the “Powered by” footer. Then they publish a survey. When the survey link is accessed via the custom domain, the page shows the company logo, the next/submit buttons and other accents are in the chosen color, and nowhere does it show the SurveyPlatform name. The URL is the custom domain. The overall effect is that it looks like the company’s own survey system. Additionally, if they send an email invite, the email shows the company name or domain as sender. Another test: try on a normal account (not white-label) – the custom domain option is not available, and the default branding (with platform name) shows on the survey footer.

### 3.9 Answer Scoring (Quizzes and Assessments)

In addition to surveys, the platform should support **scored assessments or quizzes**, where each answer option can carry a score and the respondent’s answers produce a total score or result. This feature is useful for quizzes, knowledge tests, personality assessments, or any survey where an aggregate score is needed.

**Requirements:**

* **Score Assignment per Answer:** In the survey builder, for applicable question types (typically single-choice or multiple-choice questions), allow the creator to assign point values to each answer choice. For example, a quiz question might have “Correct” answers worth 10 points and wrong answers worth 0, or partial credit like 5 points. The interface could be an additional column “Score” next to each choice when scoring is enabled.

* **Score Calculation:** The system should calculate a **total score** for each response by summing points from all answered questions. If some questions are un-answered (maybe optional ones), those just contribute 0 by default unless we have negative scoring.

* **Weighted Scoring / Importance:** Possibly allow weighting entire questions differently (so some questions contribute more to the total). For instance, the platform could normalize scores or allow multiplying by weight. However, this might complicate things; an easier approach: just assign points carefully such that important questions have answers with higher point values. (Microsoft’s Customer Voice uses a base score concept and weights, but we could simplify unless needed.)

* **Score Outcome/Display:** Decide whether the score is shown to respondent:

  * *Quizzes:* In a knowledge quiz scenario, often you show the user their score at the end (e.g., “You scored 8 out of 10!”). The platform should have an option to display the score or a custom outcome page based on score range.
  * *Assessments:* If it’s a personality test, you might not show numeric score but rather a category (e.g., “You are a Level 3 expert” or “Your risk profile is Medium”). This implies supporting score-based branching or result text. We can implement this by allowing conditional logic on the final page that shows different text based on score range (like if score >= X, show Y message).
  * Alternatively, simpler: just display a generic thank you or let the survey creator manually include a formula reference to the score in the thank you page (like using piping: “Your score is \${score}”).

* **Partial Scoring for Multi-Select:** If multiple-answer questions are scored, clarify how to score. Possibly each selected correct option yields some points, each wrong selection deducts points? This can get complex. Initially, possibly focus scoring on single-select or a special quiz question type. If multi-select scoring is needed, define that each option can have + or - points and sum them up (so picking an incorrect might add 0 or even negative to discourage guessing).

* **Scoring Activation:** Scoring should be **optional** per survey (default off). The user can turn on “Scored Survey” mode for quizzes. When on, the builder UI reveals score settings. When off (normal survey), those settings are hidden and no scores are calculated/stored. This prevents confusion for regular surveys.

* **Data Output:** The total score for each response should be stored in the results. In analytics, allow filtering or analyzing by score. Possibly include an auto-computed field. Also if categories (like pass/fail) are defined, store that as well.

* **Base Score & Normalization:** If doing advanced scoring, consider base normalization (some systems normalize to 100 or 10). We could allow setting a maximum score or just let the raw sum be the score. For simplicity, raw sum is fine. (If needed, user can always calculate percentage externally: e.g., “You got 15/20 correct.”)

* **Quiz Timer (Advanced):** Not requested, but sometimes quizzes are timed. Possibly out-of-scope.

* **Use Cases:**

  * Knowledge quiz: Each question has one correct answer with points. End of survey might say “You got X out of Y correct.”
  * Personality survey: No “correct” answers, but each answer has a value on some scale, sum maps to a result (“Score 0-10: Introvert, 11-20: Ambivert, 21-30: Extrovert”).
  * Customer satisfaction index: They assign weights to certain answers to compute a satisfaction score for respondent (though usually analysis uses scores post-collection, not shown to respondent).

* **Configurability:** The user should be able to specify how the final score is derived if not a simple sum (e.g., average or weighted average). But likely, simple sum or weighted sum is enough initially. (If advanced, we can adopt Microsoft model: they allow base of 5, 10, or 100 and weight questions to compute weighted average. We might skip that complexity at first.)

* **Results Display to Creator:** In the analytics view, show distribution of scores, maybe average score.

**Reference:** “A scored survey assigns points to some or all of your question choices. This adds up to a total score... ideal for quizzes”. Qualtrics and others have similar features (Qualtrics has a Quiz Scoring option).

*Acceptance Criteria:* In the builder, user can enable scoring and assign point values to at least a few questions’ answers. Publish the survey, take it as a test: choose certain answers. After completion:

* If configured to show score: the thank you page (or result page) displays the correct total. E.g., if I answered 3 questions correctly with 1 wrong, and each was 1 point, I see “Your score: 3 out of 4”.
* The response stored in the database includes a total score field equal to 3.
* If I export results, I see each respondent’s score.
* If I set up logic to display a message for high vs low score, that logic triggers appropriately (test both conditions).
  Also test that for non-scored surveys, no score is calculated or shown anywhere. And if some questions are left blank, scoring still computes (unanswered could be 0 by default). If multiple select scoring is used, test that partial selections calculate as expected sum. If negative scoring is allowed (should we allow negative values? perhaps, to discourage certain picks), test that too.

### 3.10 Analytics and Reporting

Once responses are collected, the platform must offer powerful **Analytics and Reporting** tools so users can derive insights from the data. This includes summary statistics, data visualizations (charts, graphs), filtering and comparison tools, text analysis for open-ends, and export capabilities.

&#x20;*Example: A survey results dashboard visualizing average ratings for various attributes. The chart uses color coding (red to green) for frequencies of each rating, with the mean score shown on the right. Our platform’s analytics will provide such visual summaries to help interpret results.*

**Requirements:**

* **Real-Time Results Dashboard:** As soon as responses are received, they should be aggregated in a dashboard available to the survey creator. Provide a summary view that updates in real-time. Key elements:

  * Total number of responses (with breakdown of complete vs partial if applicable).
  * For each question: a summary of answers (e.g., frequency distribution).
  * For closed-ended questions: display automatically generated charts (pie chart for single choice, bar chart for multiple choice, bar/line for rating scales over time, etc.).
  * For numeric open-ended: show basic stats (mean, median, range).
  * For open text: list responses, possibly word cloud or text analytics (see below).

* **Visualization Types:** Support various **chart types** to represent data effectively:

  * Pie Charts for distribution of single-select questions (to visualize proportions of each answer).
  * Bar Charts for comparing counts or percentages, useful for multi-select or any categorical data, especially where order matters or to compare across groups.
  * Column or Line Charts for trends (if data has an inherent order or over time). If a survey question asked something like a rating over time, line might be used. Also if we do multiple surveys (tracking), line could show trends.
  * Stacked Bar Charts for matrix questions or multiple related questions to show composition.
  * Word Cloud for open-ended text to highlight frequent words.
  * Cross-tab tables (if two variables are selected for analysis, see “Cross-tab” below).
  * Possibly gauge or NPS-specific dial for NPS question.
  * The UI should allow toggling chart type if needed (e.g., see the data as pie vs bar).

* **Filtering and Segmentation:** Users should be able to filter results to focus on subsets. For example, filter by date (show only last week’s responses), or by an answer to a certain question (show results of Q5 only for those who answered “Yes” to Q1). Filter by any data field including custom metadata (like if a contact list had demographics, those could come in as embedded data with responses).

  * Support applying multiple filters (with AND/OR logic).
  * The dashboard should update charts based on the filter in real-time.
  * Possibly allow saving filter views (like “show me results for Women vs Men”).

* **Comparison and Cross-Tabs:** Enable comparing results between segments. This could be:

  * **Cross-Tabulation:** select two questions and produce a cross-tab matrix (contingency table) showing how answers to one question break down by categories of another. E.g., cross-tab satisfaction by region.
  * **Compare by Filter:** User picks a question and the tool generates side-by-side charts for each answer group of that question (like a split). For instance, compare NPS scores between different departments or between customers vs non-customers.
  * Show statistical info in cross-tabs if possible (counts, maybe percentages in cells, possibly significance testing if advanced).

  Cross-tabs are powerful for deeper analysis and should be a part of the analytics module for power users.

* **Text Analytics:** For open-ended text responses, provide tools to analyze them:

  * At minimum, a searchable list of responses, and perhaps a word frequency count or word cloud for a quick visual.
  * Advanced (future): sentiment analysis or topic coding (could integrate with an NLP API).
  * Maybe allow tagging or categorizing open ends manually in the interface, to then quantify them.

* **Scoring and Custom Metrics:** If the survey had scoring (3.9 above), display average score, distribution of scores (histogram or summary). Possibly allow computing other custom metrics like NPS (which is a specific calculation: %Promoters - %Detractors). We might create a special widget for NPS question type where it automatically computes the NPS score.

* **Export Data:** Provide options to export the raw data and summary:

  * **Raw Data Export:** Download responses as CSV or Excel, where each row is a respondent and columns for each question (with appropriate labels or codes). Also allow export as SPSS .sav (with variable labels) for researchers, if possible.
  * **Summary Export:** Export summary/graphs to PDF or PPT. A one-click “Export Report” that generates a nicely formatted PDF containing the charts and key stats. Ensure any filters applied can be chosen for export (e.g., export overall summary or filtered summary).
  * **Charts Export:** Allow downloading individual charts as image (PNG) for use in presentations. Or copying an image of the chart.
  * Possibly allow exporting data via API (covered in integrations section).

* **Custom Reports and Dashboards:** The platform might allow users to create custom dashboards. For example, pick specific charts and arrange them, add text or conclusions, then share that dashboard with others (like management). This could be done by saving custom views. Initially, a simpler approach: allow a “public results dashboard” that the user can share via a link, maybe with password, so stakeholders can view live results (view-only). The user should be able to select which questions or charts are visible in that public report.

* **Collaboration on Analysis:** If multiple users have access to the survey results (team features), allow them to comment or note insights in the platform (could be future). At least allow sharing within team easily (maybe an “invite teammate to view results” which grants them access).

* **Performance of Analytics:** The system should be capable of handling analysis for large response sets (say 10,000+ responses) without timing out. This might involve efficient querying or pre-aggregation. Possibly implement pagination or sampling for very large open-end lists to avoid UI overload.

* **Data Retention and Updates:** If new responses come in while user is viewing the dashboard, decide if it auto-refreshes or if a refresh button appears. Auto-refresh could be nice if it’s real-time (with caution on performance). At least manual refresh should update counts.

* **Security:** Ensure that only authorized users (survey owner or those they've shared with) can view the results. Public dashboards should be off by default unless the user deliberately shares.

**Reference Benchmarks:** SurveyMonkey emphasizes turning data into insights with charts and the ability to “slice and dice” results with filters and comparisons. They offer interactive graphs (pie, bar, line) and data exports to PDF/CSV. Our platform aims to provide a similarly rich toolkit for analysis.

*Acceptance Criteria:* After collecting responses to a test survey:

* The dashboard shows total responses and a visual for each question. For a single-select Q, it shows a pie chart with correct proportions that match the data (verify with the raw data).
* Apply a filter (e.g., only include those who answered “USA” to country question) – the charts update to reflect just that subset.
* Create a cross-tab of two questions and verify counts match expectations from raw data.
* Export raw data and check that all responses are present in CSV.
* Export PDF summary and check that key charts appear with labels and perhaps some stats.
* If a survey has an NPS question (0-10 scale with text labels), verify that the system correctly calculates NPS (we should specifically implement identification of “Promoters” (9-10) and “Detractors” (0-6) and shows the NPS = %Promoters - %Detractors).
* Check open-end responses: ensure you can read them and search them (e.g., search for a keyword).
* If applicable, test that sharing a dashboard link works (someone not logged in can view a read-only report, if we built that, and they cannot see any identifier info if the survey is anonymous).
* Also test performance: on a dataset of, say, 5000 dummy responses, the page should load within a reasonable time and interactions (filtering) should be maybe a few seconds at most.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

Beyond the specific features, the platform must meet several **non-functional requirements** to ensure it is robust, secure, and scalable for enterprise use.

### 4.1 Scalability and Performance

The application should be designed to scale to a large number of users, surveys, and responses without significant degradation in performance.

* **User Load:** The system should support many concurrent users (survey creators in the admin UI, and respondents taking surveys). For instance, it might be required to handle *at least* 10,000 concurrent respondents across all surveys initially, scaling up to 100,000+ with proper infrastructure (these numbers to be refined with actual capacity tests). As a reference, a requirement might be phrased as “the platform must successfully handle 1M concurrent users” in an ideal high-end scenario, though we will align goals with available resources. We will set concrete, measurable targets (e.g., support X surveys active each with Y respondents simultaneously).

* **Response Throughput:** The system should handle high-throughput scenarios, such as a popular survey receiving hundreds of submissions per minute, without errors or significant slowdowns. Each submitted response should be processed (saved to database) quickly (within, say, <500ms server processing time) so that the respondent isn’t waiting long after hitting Submit.

* **Latency:** For respondents, page load times should be minimal. A survey page (with typical content) should load within 2 seconds on a broadband connection (excluding media load). Navigation (Next page) should also be responsive (<2 seconds). For the survey builder UI, loading the editor for an existing survey should take <3 seconds for reasonably sized surveys (e.g., 50 questions). Analytics queries should ideally return within a few seconds for moderately sized datasets (some heavy queries like a cross-tab on 100k responses might take longer, but maybe <10 seconds with optimized queries/caching).

* **Database Scalability:** Design the data model to handle potentially millions of responses and many surveys. Use indexing and sharding strategies as needed. Consider partitioning response data by survey ID for performance, etc. Maybe utilize cloud-managed databases that can scale.

* **Stateless & Horizontal Scaling:** The application servers should be stateless (session info minimal or shared via cache) to allow horizontal scaling. If load increases, we can add more server instances to handle traffic. Ensure that any in-memory caches or session data are either not critical or are shared (via Redis or similar), so scaling out doesn’t break things.

* **Efficient Frontend:** Use CDN for static assets (scripts, styles) and possibly for survey content if heavy. Minify and bundle resources to reduce load times. Ensure the use of caching (e.g., set appropriate cache headers for survey-taking static assets since those can be same across respondents).

* **Load Testing:** We will perform load tests to simulate heavy usage and identify bottlenecks. For example, simulate 1000 users starting a survey within a minute and submitting, see if any server errors or slow responses occur. Also test a scenario of many parallel email invites being clicked (spike).

* **Graceful Degradation:** If the system is under extreme load, it should still handle it gracefully (maybe queue responses briefly rather than failing). Implementing backpressure if needed (though we aim to autoscale to meet demand).

* **Multi-Tenancy Isolation:** Ensure one client’s heavy usage doesn’t starve others (this might be infrastructure level via scaling, or certain limits per tenant).

* **Max Survey Size Limits:** To ensure performance, we might impose practical limits (document for users): e.g., max 200 questions per survey, max 10,000 contacts per email send in one batch (or use multiple batches), etc. These should be generous but protect the system.

*Acceptance Criteria:* Under a test with X concurrent survey takers (as per design goal, say 1000), the average page load remains under 3 seconds and error rate is under 0.1%. Database is observed to handle Y writes/sec of responses. We should record these metrics in testing. Also, test large surveys (e.g., 100 questions) with 1000 responses to ensure analytics queries still perform. If any performance issue arises (like a particular query is slow), optimize or put in known limitations. We should also ensure linear scalability - if we double the server resources, we can handle roughly double load.

### 4.2 Security and Data Privacy

Security is paramount since the platform will collect potentially sensitive data. We must protect data at all stages and comply with privacy regulations like GDPR.

* **Data Encryption In-Transit:** All communications between client (user browser) and server must be encrypted via HTTPS (TLS 1.2+). No plain HTTP for any API or page that handles data. Certificates need to be properly managed (auto-renew, support SNI for custom domains, etc.).

* **Data Encryption At-Rest:** Sensitive data in the database, especially personal identifiable information (PII) and survey responses, should be encrypted at rest (either whole DB encryption or field-level if needed). Use industry-standard algorithms (AES-256, etc.). Even if someone gains access to database files, they shouldn’t easily read user data without keys.

* **Access Control & Authentication:** The application should enforce strong authentication for survey creators (password policies, maybe 2FA for admin accounts). Use role-based access control for all admin functionalities (only authorized roles can view certain data, etc.). Ensure that one client’s data cannot be accessed by another (multi-tenant isolation at application level as well).

* **Secure Development Practices:** Prevent common vulnerabilities:

  * Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, CSRF.
  * Use parameterized queries or ORM for DB.
  * For file uploads (images/videos), check file types and scan if needed to avoid malware upload.
  * Don’t expose any secret keys to client.
  * Regularly update dependencies to patch security issues.

* **Penetration Testing:** Plan for security testing or code audit. Particularly ensure the survey-taking interface cannot be exploited (it’s public). E.g., someone might try to inject script into a survey response – ensure that when displaying results or exporting, those are properly escaped (to avoid XSS in reports).

* **GDPR Compliance:** If serving EU users, comply with GDPR:

  * **Consent:** If surveys collect personal data, ensure the survey creators can include a consent question. Possibly provide templates or features for consent.
  * **Data Subject Rights:** Provide means to delete a respondent’s data upon request. If a respondent contacts saying “delete my responses”, the survey owner should be able to remove that response completely. Similarly allow exporting an individual’s data if needed.
  * **Privacy Policy & Terms:** Have clear policies in place. Possibly allow enterprise clients to have a custom privacy notice for respondents.
  * Store data in allowed regions if required by client (some might ask for EU-only data hosting).
  * **Anonymization:** If a survey is set to anonymous, ensure no identifying info (like email or IP address if suppressed) is stored with responses.

* **Other Compliance:** Consider other standards:

  * CCPA (California) similar rights as GDPR.
  * If dealing with health data (unlikely unless user does so, then possibly HIPAA – that’s a whole other level requiring BAA, encryption, audit logging).
  * Accessibility (ADA/WCAG) might come under compliance too (we should aim for WCAG AA in the UI).
  * If marketing to enterprises, they might expect ISO 27001 or SOC 2 compliance eventually. So our processes and security controls should align with those frameworks (e.g., regular backups, employee access control, incident response plan).

* **Encryption Key Management:** Manage encryption keys securely (e.g., using cloud KMS services). Rotate keys periodically if possible.

* **Secure Access & Audit:** Provide secure account management for users: ability to reset password securely, detect unusual login (maybe alert if login from new device), etc. Also have audit logs for admin actions (like who viewed/exported what data) to track any potential misuse internally.

* **Data Backup:** Regularly back up data (encrypted) to prevent loss, and have a disaster recovery plan.

* **Secure Data Deletion:** When users delete a survey or response, ensure it’s removed from production systems (and eventually from backups per retention policy). Possibly implement a “soft delete” with retention period in case of accidental deletion, but after that, it should be permanently expunged.

* **Client-side Security:** The survey form should not expose sensitive info in source (shouldn’t have hidden fields with info that could be manipulated). Also protect against bots (maybe have an option for CAPTCHA on surveys to prevent spam responses for public surveys).

* **Privacy by Design:** Minimization of data collection by us – we only collect what’s necessary. If our system collects respondents’ IP addresses (it often does by default in logs), allow survey owners to disable storing IP if they want full anonymity to respondents.

**Reference:** SurveyMonkey’s security center emphasizes data encryption and secure access: “data encryption is a key line of defense to prevent unauthorized access...Encryption encodes data so it’s unreadable without the key”. We will implement encryption in line with industry standards (TLS, AES etc.). Also GDPR requires giving control to individuals over their data – our platform will enable compliance by design.

*Acceptance Criteria:* Security is a continuous requirement, but for testing:

* All API endpoints tested with HTTP (instead of HTTPS) should refuse connection or redirect to HTTPS.
* Simulate an XSS attempt: e.g., in a text response enter `<script>alert('x')</script>` and then view results in the dashboard or export – verify that the script does not execute (it should be escaped and shown literally or stripped).
* Try a SQL injection via survey input if direct API is known – ensure it doesn’t break anything (most likely it will just be treated as data).
* Ensure one user cannot access another’s survey by changing an ID in the URL (proper authorization checks).
* In the database, verify that sensitive columns (like user passwords, if we store them – which should be hashed and salted, not plaintext) and any contact info are encrypted or hashed.
* GDPR: Delete a test response and verify it no longer appears in exports or analytics. Also check that a user can export a single response’s data easily if needed.
* Run an automated security scan tool for web vulnerabilities and address any high findings.
* On the policy side, ensure our privacy policy is up and users of the platform can enter their own privacy contact info if needed (especially if they are controllers of data in GDPR terms).
* Check that backups are happening and can be restored (for DR). Also ensure if needed that data is isolated per region for clients who need that (maybe an EU deployment separate).

### 4.3 Integration and Extensibility (APIs & Webhooks)

The platform should not be a silo; it needs to integrate with other systems to fit into various workflows. This includes providing APIs for external applications to interact with the survey platform, and webhooks to push data out in real-time to other services.

* **REST API:** Provide a comprehensive **API** for key operations. This would include endpoints (with proper authentication, e.g., API keys or OAuth) for:

  * **Survey Management:** Create a new survey, update survey details, fetch survey structure, delete a survey.
  * **Collector Management:** (If applicable) create links or get link URLs.
  * **Sending Invites:** Possibly trigger sending an email invitation via API.
  * **Response Retrieval:** Fetch responses for a survey (maybe in paginated form or by streaming), including details of each response. Possibly allow filtering by date or respondent.
  * **Response Submission:** Though primary responses come via the survey web form, having an API to submit responses could allow integrations (for example, if someone wanted to feed data from another source into the survey for consistency).
  * **Contacts API:** CRUD operations on contact lists (to integrate with CRM).
  * All API endpoints should enforce the security and permissions (an API key likely is tied to a user account or service account that has access to certain surveys).
  * Use JSON for data format. Document the API clearly (we might produce an OpenAPI spec).

* **Webhooks (Outgoing):** Allow users to set up **webhooks** so that when certain events happen, we send an HTTP POST to a URL they provide. Primarily:

  * **New Response Submitted:** This is the most useful webhook – e.g., as soon as a respondent completes a survey, the platform sends the response data to a specified endpoint (perhaps in JSON format). This enables real-time integration, like pushing into a CRM or database as soon as feedback arrives.
  * **Survey Completed Event:** (Could be same as new response, or if partial responses etc. probably just use response event).
  * **Email Bounce Event:** If we manage email sending and get bounce notifications, optionally webhook those to the user’s system (less likely needed).
  * **Response Updated (if editing allowed):** maybe not needed since usually responses are not edited by respondents after submission (except on some forms).
  * **Schedule triggers:** Some advanced could be like when survey closes or hits quota, but not as critical.

  Webhook payloads should include necessary info (survey ID, maybe respondent ID or details, and answers). Keep it secure – provide an option to include a signature (HMAC) so the receiver can verify it’s from us (common practice in webhooks).

* **Incoming Webhooks (or API triggers):** Possibly allow our platform to accept incoming webhooks from other systems to trigger actions. But that might just be done via API (like an external system can call our API to create a response or to close a survey).

* **Integration Directory:** Identify popular integrations:

  * CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot) – these could use our webhooks (to push survey results into a contact’s record) or our API.
  * Zapier integration: If we provide webhooks and API, we can create a Zapier app so non-tech users integrate without coding. E.g., “When new Survey Response, add row to Google Sheets” or “send Slack message” etc. (Zapier basically listens to webhook triggers and uses our API for actions).
  * Native Integrations: Perhaps later, build direct integration with Salesforce (like SmartSurvey does) or others if demand.
  * Single Sign-On (SSO): integration with corporate SSO (SAML/OAuth) for user login to the platform (admin side). (This is more a feature for admin login, but worth noting for enterprise readiness).
  * Embeddable Widget: Integration in the sense of embedding surveys in mobile apps or websites easily (maybe provide a mobile SDK or JS snippet).
  * If the platform extends to in-app surveys, then SDK for mobile to pop surveys.

* **Extensibility:** Provide a plugin or extension mechanism if possible. Possibly allow injecting custom JavaScript in the survey (that’s dangerous, but some advanced users might want to add tracking or custom behavior – though enabling arbitrary JS can be a security risk, so maybe limited or vetted extensions). Perhaps we allow adding Google Analytics tracking code or similar to the survey pages. Or allow integrating with Tag Managers as SmartSurvey mentions integration with Google Tag Manager to track respondent journey.

* **API Rate Limits:** To protect the system, implement reasonable rate limiting on APIs (like X requests per minute, documented to users). Also ensure webhooks are robust (retry on failure with exponential backoff, etc., so we don’t drop data if the receiving end is temporarily down).

* **Developer Portal:** Provide documentation (online docs) for using the API and webhooks. Possibly a sandbox or test key for users to try things. Also, provide example code for common tasks (like a Python script to fetch results, etc.).

**References:** SmartSurvey’s features page mentions connecting with Salesforce and using Zapier for no-code integrations. We similarly should allow such connectivity. “Automatically and securely transfer every response that comes in to an endpoint you define (webhooks ideal for one-way integrations)” and “API allows two-way integrations to query data, distribute surveys, update contacts, etc..” These statements encapsulate what we need to deliver.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* We can register a webhook for a survey (via UI or API) to a requestbin or test server. Then take the survey as a respondent. We observe that our server POSTs the response data to the test endpoint within seconds of completion. If the endpoint returns 200, we mark delivered. If it fails (simulate by returning 500), our system retries after a delay.
* Use the API: With an API token, make calls to create a survey, add a question, publish it, submit a response via API, then retrieve responses. Verify that each step works as per API spec and data persists consistent with what the web UI shows.
* If possible, test a Zapier integration using a webhook trigger and ensure it can parse our payload.
* Security: ensure API requires auth and rejects unauthorized calls. Test that one cannot fetch someone else’s survey data with wrong token.
* Test for rate limiting: hammer an endpoint and see if we start getting 429 Too Many Requests as expected.
* Also test that integration toggles in UI (like turning on GTM tracking) actually insert the needed script in survey pages.

### 4.4 Administration and User Management

The platform will have an **Administrative interface** to manage users, roles, and overall system configuration for each organization (tenant). This section details requirements for user roles, permissions, and admin controls.

* **User Roles and Permissions:** Implement a role-based access control system with at least the following roles:

  * **Owner / Primary Admin:** The main account holder (for a company, maybe the one who set up the subscription). Has full permissions: can create/edit/delete all surveys in the organization, manage billing (if applicable), manage users, and change settings.
  * **Administrator (Org Admin):** Similar to Owner for managing users and surveys, but maybe without billing access.
  * **Survey Creator / Editor:** Can create new surveys, and edit surveys they have created or that are shared with them. Can view all responses for those surveys. Cannot manage other users.
  * **Analyst / Viewer:** Can view responses and reports, but not edit survey questions. For example, a user with this role can be given access to the analytics dashboard of a survey to derive insights, but cannot change the survey itself.
  * **Contributor (Limited Editor):** (like SurveyMonkey’s contributor seat) – maybe can only edit certain aspects or only draft questions but not launch? This might be too granular for MVP.
  * **Guest Reviewer:** Perhaps a role that can only view a survey design or test it, but not see real data.

  We should allow assigning roles per user, and possibly sharing a specific survey with specific users with certain rights (survey-level permissions overriding global role in some cases, e.g., share a single survey with an external consultant to view results).

  Reference: SurveyMonkey teams have Primary Admin, Full User, and Contributor roles with differing permissions. We can model similarly:

  * Primary Admin (full control),
  * Full User (create/send/analyze surveys),
  * Contributor (analyze and maybe comment, but not send).

  We will refine definitions to fit our platform.

* **Admin Dashboard:** Provide an admin area where an organization admin can:

  * Invite new users to the team (send invitation email).
  * Assign or change roles of users.
  * Remove users.
  * See usage statistics (how many surveys, responses used vs their plan limits, etc.).
  * Manage global settings like single sign-on config, data retention policies, branding (as discussed in white-label).
  * Possibly manage template library for their org (upload custom templates).

  For platform-level super admin (our internal use), there would be another layer but that’s more internal.

* **Team Collaboration:** If multiple users in same org, allow them to share surveys. A simple approach: by default, all surveys created are visible to all users in that org with at least view rights. Alternatively, have sharing controls per survey (the owner can choose to share with others or keep private). For MVP, maybe simplest: any admin or full user can see all org’s surveys. Or we could say each survey has an owner and can add collaborators explicitly. This needs design – but likely in enterprise, a collaborative environment is expected (multiple users, admin dashboard controls).

* **Permission Matrix:** Document which role can perform which actions. E.g.:

  | Action                               | Owner/Admin | Editor                | Analyst/Viewer            |
  | ------------------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
  | Create a new survey                  | Yes         | Yes                   | No                        |
  | Delete a survey                      | Yes         | Maybe only their own  | No                        |
  | Edit survey design/questions         | Yes (all)   | Yes (their or shared) | No                        |
  | Launch/Send survey                   | Yes         | Yes                   | No (maybe can if allowed) |
  | View responses & analytics           | Yes         | Yes (their surveys)   | Yes (if shared or all)    |
  | Manage users (invite/remove)         | Yes         | No                    | No                        |
  | Manage billing/subscription          | Yes (Owner) | No                    | No                        |
  | Change org settings (branding, etc.) | Yes (Admin) | No                    | No                        |

  We will implement enforcement accordingly in UI and backend.

* **Auditing:** Log key actions in an audit log (especially admin actions like deleting a survey or exporting data). Perhaps not exposed in UI initially, but keep records for security/compliance.

* **Usage Monitoring:** Admin should see how many responses have been collected, maybe how many emails sent, etc. This helps manage plan limits or just monitor usage. If quotas are approaching, possibly warn.

* **Backup and Recovery (Admin-facing):** Possibly allow admins to export all their data (all surveys and responses) for backup if they want. Also, if they accidentally deleted a survey, maybe support restore within X days (that might need recycle bin concept).

* **Multi-Org management:** If our system supports parent-child organizations or something, probably not needed initially. Each account/org is separate.

* **Support & Troubleshooting:** Admin panel might allow generating support tickets or contacting us, but that's more of a SaaS support aspect.

**Reference:** “White label solution with ... Multiple users for collaboration and enterprise deployment; Admin dashboard and user controls” suggests enterprise usage of multiple roles and an admin control center. Also Qualtrics and SurveyMonkey have robust user management features in enterprise plans, with roles and libraries.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* An admin user can invite a colleague as an “Analyst”. The colleague logs in and sees only surveys that admin shared or gave permission to. The analyst tries to edit questions and is prevented (UI doesn’t even show edit button, or if they hack something it’s unauthorized).
* An Editor user creates a survey, and by default an Admin user can see it (assuming that’s our design).
* An admin can change the Editor’s role to Viewer and then that user can no longer create new surveys (verify by attempt).
* Try a scenario: a non-admin user attempts to access the user management page by URL – they should get access denied.
* If we have per-survey sharing: share Survey X with User Y as Viewer – then User Y logs in and sees Survey X results but cannot edit it or see other surveys.
* Remove a user: if that user owned some surveys, decide what happens (maybe admin can reassign ownership, or they remain but with no owner until someone takes over). We should define and test this (maybe easiest: admin can always access everything anyway, so ownership is just logical).
* Test that an analyst can export data if we allow that (maybe yes they can since just viewing data).
* Ensure that the admin can update the org branding (if allowed) and that applies to all surveys (this overlaps with white-label).
* If applicable, test SSO login as admin and as normal user if configured (though implementing SSO might be later).
