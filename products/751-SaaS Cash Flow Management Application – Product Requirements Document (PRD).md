# SaaS Cash Flow Management Application – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** May 5, 2025
**Prepared by:** Product Management Team

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of Document

This document is a comprehensive **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for a SaaS-based Cash Flow Management application. It defines the product’s vision, business context, and detailed software requirements. The purpose is to provide a clear specification of functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and design considerations for the development team and stakeholders. By outlining these details, the PRD ensures that everyone — from product managers to engineers — shares a common understanding of what the application must achieve and how it should operate.

### 1.2 Product Overview and Scope

The **Cash Flow Management application** is a cloud-based platform that enables businesses to plan, monitor, and optimize their cash flow. It offers core features including:

- **Cash Flow Reporting:** Real-time and historical reports showing income sources and expense destinations.
- **Transaction Management:** Ability to add, edit, and schedule one-time or recurring cash flow items (inflows and outflows), with detailed line item breakdowns for each payment or deposit.
- **Forecasting:** Tools to forecast future cash flows using historical data, recurring schedules, and user-defined assumptions.
- **Budgeting:** Modules to set budgets and compare actual performance against targets.
- **Invoice Management:** Features to create, send, and track invoices as part of managing accounts receivable, integrated with cash flow tracking.
- **Integrations:** Connectivity with popular accounting systems (QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, SAP) to import/export financial data and avoid duplicate data entry.
- **User Management:** Role-based access for multiple users within an organization with appropriate permissions.
- **Scalability & Security:** A robust SaaS architecture that can scale to many users and ensure data security for sensitive financial information.

**Scope:** This PRD covers the requirements for the initial release (v1.0) of the application. It includes detailed functional requirements for each module and relevant non-functional requirements (security, scalability, etc.). Integration with third-party accounting software (via their APIs) is in scope. The focus is on small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs) and their finance teams, though larger enterprise considerations (NetSuite, SAP integration) are acknowledged.

**Out of Scope:** The application is not intended to replace full accounting systems or ERPs; rather, it complements them by specializing in cash flow planning and related tasks. Payroll processing, tax filing, or full general ledger accounting are out-of-scope. Any features mentioned as future enhancements or roadmap items will not be included in the initial release.

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Use

This document is intended for **product managers, designers, developers, QA engineers, and stakeholders** involved in building the Cash Flow Management application. Product managers can use it to understand business goals and ensure the product meets market needs. Developers and technical teams will use the functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and diagrams as the basis for system design and implementation. QA teams will derive test cases from the requirements and user scenarios described. Additionally, management and marketing teams can refer to sections like Business Goals, Competitive Landscape, and Go-to-Market for strategic alignment.

### 1.4 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

To ensure clarity, the following key terms and acronyms are used throughout this document:

- **SaaS:** Software as a Service – a software delivery model in which the application is hosted in the cloud and accessed via the internet (subscription-based).
- **Cash Flow:** The movement of money into and out of a business. _Cash Inflows_ (income) include revenue, loans, investments; _Cash Outflows_ (expenses) include bills, salaries, loan repayments.
- **Cash Flow Forecast:** An estimate of future cash inflows and outflows over a period, projecting the company’s cash position. (See **Business Goals** section for importance of forecasting.)
- **QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, SAP:** Widely-used accounting software/platforms. QuickBooks and Xero are popular among small and mid-sized businesses; NetSuite and SAP cater to mid-market and enterprise. Integration with these ensures our application can exchange data with systems already used by our customers.
- **API:** Application Programming Interface – how our application will communicate with external systems (e.g., QuickBooks API for data sync).
- **Recurring Transaction:** A payment or receipt that occurs on a regular schedule (e.g., monthly rent, weekly payroll). Instead of entering each occurrence manually, the system can schedule it to recur automatically.
- **Accounts Payable (AP):** Money a business owes to others (bills, supplier invoices) – typically cash outflows.
- **Accounts Receivable (AR):** Money others owe to the business (customer invoices) – typically cash inflows. Managing AR is related to invoice management.
- **KPI:** Key Performance Indicator – measurable values that indicate the success of the product (e.g., user adoption, customer retention).
- **RBAC:** Role-Based Access Control – a security model where user permissions are tied to roles. Only users with appropriate roles can perform certain actions (detailed in **User Roles** and **Security** sections).

## 2. Business Goals and Objectives

### 2.1 Business Background and Problem Statement

Managing cash flow is critical for businesses of all sizes. A healthy cash flow ensures that a company can pay its expenses, invest in growth, and weather financial challenges. Many businesses currently struggle with cash flow visibility and forecasting:

- **Fragmented Tools:** It’s common to use multiple tools (spreadsheets, accounting software, budgeting apps) to piece together a view of cash flow. In fact, 60% of small businesses report using two to three different products to manage cash flow. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies and potential errors when consolidating data.
- **Lack of Real-Time Insight:** Traditional accounting software (like QuickBooks) records transactions but may not provide forward-looking insights. Product managers and finance teams often resort to manual forecasting in spreadsheets, which is time-consuming and error-prone.
- **Unpredictable Cash Surprises:** Without proper forecasting, businesses may face unexpected cash shortages or miss opportunities to invest surpluses. This can lead to emergency borrowing or lost growth opportunities. According to industry experts, a cash flow forecast is a **critical tool** for projecting financial health, helping to time financing needs and plan for shortages.
- **Inadequate Budget Control:** Companies set budgets, but monitoring actual cash flow against those budgets in real-time is challenging with existing tools. This makes it harder to adjust spending proactively.
- **Delayed Collections:** Inefficient invoice management can slow down cash inflows (e.g., late payments from clients), directly hurting cash availability. Timely invoicing and tracking are crucial to maintain steady cash flow.
- **Integration Gaps:** Accounting systems hold a wealth of financial data. Without integration, finance teams must manually transfer data (e.g., re-entering the same transactions into a forecast spreadsheet), which wastes time and can introduce discrepancies.

### 2.2 Product Vision

The vision of the Cash Flow Management application is to **provide businesses with a single, unified platform to understand past, present, and future cash flow**. It should be as indispensable to a finance manager as a compass to a navigator – guiding financial decisions with clarity and foresight. Our product will serve as a bridge between day-to-day accounting and strategic financial planning, automating routine tasks and surfacing critical insights.

**Key aspects of the vision:**

- **Unification:** Consolidate cash flow related tasks (reporting, forecasting, budgeting, invoicing) in one platform to eliminate the need for juggling multiple systems.
- **Real-Time Insights:** Enable up-to-date cash positions and continuously updated projections so users can make decisions with the latest information.
- **Proactivity:** Allow users to foresee cash shortfalls or surpluses well in advance, so they can secure financing or plan investments proactively rather than reactively.
- **Accessibility:** As a SaaS solution, ensure the data is accessible anytime, anywhere (via web or mobile), and easily understandable through visualizations and intuitive UI.
- **Automation:** Reduce manual work by syncing with accounting software and scheduling recurring transactions and invoices. Automation minimizes human error and frees time for analysis.
- **Actionable Intelligence:** Provide not just raw data but actionable insights (e.g., alerts for low future cash balance, suggestions to adjust budgets, identification of largest expense drains).
- **Related Services Integration:** Position the platform as the central hub for financial operations by integrating related services (e.g., connect to payment gateways for invoice payments, or bank feeds for direct transaction import in future versions).

### 2.3 Objectives and Success Criteria

The following are the primary objectives of the product and how we will measure success:

- **Improve Cash Flow Visibility:** Provide comprehensive cash flow reports (historical and forecast) that are easy to interpret.
  _Success Indicator:_ At least 90% of pilot users report improved visibility into their cash flow after using the product (via survey), and a reduction in time spent preparing cash flow reports by >50%.
- **Reduce Tool Fragmentation:** Offer all core features in one platform to reduce dependency on multiple tools.
  _Success Indicator:_ Achieve high feature adoption – e.g., >80% of users who set up the app integrate their accounting software and use at least 3 of the 5 major modules (reports, forecast, budgeting, invoicing, recurring transactions), indicating reliance on our single platform.
- **Enhance Forecast Accuracy & Proactiveness:** Help users create forecasts that closely mirror reality and prompt them to act on insights.
  _Success Indicator:_ Positive user feedback or case studies where our forecast alerted a business to a future cash issue or surplus and they took action (qualitative), and at least 70% of users utilize the forecasting module regularly (quantitative usage metric).
- **Streamline Invoicing and Collections:** Improve the speed at which businesses get paid by providing easy invoice management and tracking.
  _Success Indicator:_ Users report reduced Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) after using our invoice module (e.g., a drop by several days on average), and at least 50% of invoices generated through our system are paid by or before the due date (tracked via system metrics).
- **Facilitate Budget Adherence:** Help businesses stay on budget by providing timely tracking and alerts.
  _Success Indicator:_ Users can identify budget variances quickly; aim for at least 75% of users setting budgets in the system, and anecdotal evidence of prevented overspending (gather via user interviews).
- **Seamless Integration Experience:** Ensure connecting with external accounting systems is simple and valuable.
  _Success Indicator:_ At least 60% of users integrate an external accounting system (within 1 month of onboarding) due to clear value. Also, integration support issues are minimal (e.g., <5% of users report sync problems in support logs).
- **Scalability and Reliability:** The platform should perform well as usage grows and be reliable.
  _Success Indicator:_ Maintain >99.9% uptime in production, and be capable of supporting large data volumes (we aim to handle businesses with up to 5-10 years of historical data and tens of thousands of transactions without performance degradation).
- **Customer Satisfaction & Growth:** Ultimately, the product should drive business success for our company.
  _Success Indicator:_ High customer satisfaction (target CSAT > 4.5/5 or NPS > 50). Meeting adoption targets (e.g., X paying customers in year 1) and low churn (<5% churn in first year) will be key KPIs (details in Section 11).

These objectives align the product’s success with both user value (better cash management leading to business stability/growth for customers) and company value (user adoption, revenue from subscriptions, market penetration in this software category).

### 2.4 Competitive Advantage

Our Cash Flow Management application’s competitive edge will come from a combination of **breadth of features, ease of use, and integration**:

- **Holistic Cash Management:** Unlike many point solutions that only do forecasting or only handle invoices, our product covers the end-to-end spectrum (from recording transactions to forecasting outcomes), reducing the need to patch together different tools. This addresses the pain point of using multiple systems and the desire to consolidate.
- **Tight Accounting Integration:** By integrating deeply with leading accounting software, we eliminate duplicate data entry and ensure our platform is always up-to-date with actuals. Many existing cash flow tools require manual CSV imports or aren’t real-time; our seamless sync (auto and on-demand) provides a superior experience.
- **User Experience for Finance Teams:** We design specifically for product managers and finance professionals who may not be accounting experts but need financial insight. The interface will prioritize clarity: visual charts, straightforward terminology, and guided flows (wizards for setting up forecasts or budgets). Simpler UI and setup than complex FP\&A software or ERP modules will make our solution accessible to a wider audience.
- **Intelligent Forecasting:** We plan to incorporate smart forecasting techniques (using historical patterns and perhaps machine learning in future iterations) to provide more accurate or insightful projections than basic linear forecasts. For example, highlighting seasonal trends or offering scenario analysis easily.
- **Real-Time Collaboration & Multi-User Support:** Our role-based system means multiple team members (CEO, CFO, accountants, etc.) can collaborate on the platform securely, which is harder to do with single-user spreadsheets.
- **Modular and Extensible:** Users can start with just what they need (e.g., maybe just use it for forecasting initially) and later adopt other modules like invoicing or budgeting. This modular approach (while maintaining one integrated data model) means we can attract users with one compelling feature and then increase value delivered over time with other features.
- **Focus on Cash Flow:** While competitors like QuickBooks have cash flow features, it’s not their core focus. Our entire product is centered on cash flow excellence, meaning we can provide more depth in that domain (like advanced analytics on cash drivers, specialized reports, etc.) that general accounting software doesn’t prioritize.

Business goals and objectives will be revisited periodically to ensure the product remains aligned with solving the key problems identified and delivering on the promised vision.

## 3. Competitive Landscape

Understanding the competitive and alternative solutions in the market is crucial for positioning our product. Below, we outline various categories of solutions that businesses use for cash flow management, and how our application compares.

### 3.1 Direct Competitors (Dedicated Cash Flow Management Tools)

There are specialized cash flow management and forecasting tools on the market which target similar problems:

- **PlanGuru:** A budgeting and forecasting software enabling up to 10-year forecasts. Offers robust analytics and the ability to import multiple years of data for scenario planning. Geared towards financial analysts and offers extensive forecasting methods.
- **Float:** An award-winning cash-flow forecasting app that connects with accounting software (like Xero, QuickBooks) to pull in data. It focuses on easy budget creation and scenario adjustments, giving a clear picture of future cash based on different assumptions.
- **Pulse:** A simple online tool (with mobile app) focused entirely on cash flow tracking for business owners. It provides straightforward tracking of cash in/out and basic projections, aiming to be user-friendly for non-finance managers.
- **CashAnalytics:** A robust cash management tool aimed at mid-market and larger businesses. It provides detailed cash forecasting, often used by finance departments for liquidity planning. It can handle complex corporate structures and is positioned for more sophisticated cash management needs (treasury-level features).
- **Others:** Tools like **CashFlow Frog**, **Dryrun**, **Fathom**, and **Jirav** also operate in this space, often differentiating by integration capabilities or specific analytics.

**Our Positioning vs Direct Competitors:**
Our application aims to combine the ease-of-use of tools like Pulse/Float with some of the analytical power found in higher-end tools like CashAnalytics, all while maintaining tight integration with accounting systems and adding invoice management (which many pure forecasting tools do not include). We offer a more comprehensive suite (covering budgeting and invoicing) than many forecasting-only tools. By tailoring the user experience to product managers and small business owners (not just accountants), we differentiate on approachability. Additionally, our strength will be in real-time sync and automation: some competitors require manual updates or aren’t truly real-time if their integrations are limited.

### 3.2 Indirect Competitors and Alternatives

Many businesses use non-specialized tools or existing systems to manage cash flow, which indirectly compete as “status quo” solutions:

- **Accounting Software Built-ins:** Popular accounting platforms like **QuickBooks**, **Xero**, and **Sage** have basic cash flow reporting or projection features. For example, QuickBooks includes a rudimentary cash flow projector and various financial statements. QuickBooks is one of the most popular accounting softwares globally and dominates the small-business accounting market (85% market share in that category), so many businesses simply use QuickBooks’ reports or Excel exports for cash planning. However, these built-in features are often limited (e.g., forecasts might not account for future recurring bills, and scenario planning is minimal).
- **Spreadsheets (Excel/Google Sheets):** This is perhaps the **most common alternative**. Businesses export data from accounting software and build custom cash flow spreadsheets or use templates. Spreadsheets offer flexibility but can become complex and error-prone. They also lack integration (manual updates needed) and multi-user capabilities (version control issues). Despite their drawbacks, spreadsheets remain a go-to due to familiarity and control.
- **FP\&A (Financial Planning & Analysis) Tools:** Larger companies might use comprehensive planning tools like **Adaptive Insights (Workday Adaptive Planning)**, **Anaplan**, or **Vena** which include cash flow forecasting as part of a broader suite (budgeting, consolidations, etc.). These are powerful but often too expensive or complex for smaller companies. They target finance professionals and involve significant setup.
- **ERP Modules:** For enterprises using systems like **SAP** or **Oracle NetSuite**, there are treasury or cash management modules available. These integrate with the company’s full financials. However, they often require specialist implementation and may not be as user-friendly. Many mid-sized firms using NetSuite still export data to spreadsheets for cash analysis due to flexibility reasons.
- **Bank / FinTech Solutions:** Some banks offer basic cash flow forecasting tools integrated with bank accounts, and fintech services (like some online banking dashboards) provide short-term cash projections based on bank transactions. These tend to focus on very short horizons (weeks, not months) and don’t incorporate non-bank data (like future planned expenses not yet in the bank account).

**Our Positioning vs Indirect Alternatives:**
We aim to attract users who have outgrown spreadsheets or find their accounting software insufficient for proactive cash management. The inefficiencies of using multiple tools (accounting software + spreadsheets + maybe separate budget tools) are a key pain point we resolve. A 2022 survey indicated 84% of small-business owners felt that consolidating cash flow management into one platform would save them significant time (estimated 3–8 hours a week). This underscores an appetite for an integrated solution like ours.

Compared to heavy FP\&A tools or ERP modules, our solution is lighter-weight and faster to deploy — no lengthy implementations, just connect your accounts and go. We offer more automation and intelligence than a spreadsheet, and more flexibility and depth specifically in cash flow planning than generic accounting packages. In summary, we position ourselves as **the unified, intelligent, yet easy-to-use cash flow command center** for businesses, standing out against both simpler and more complex alternatives by hitting a sweet spot in between.

### 3.3 Notable Competitor Features

To ensure our product meets or exceeds market standards, we’ve analyzed some notable features in competitor products that we may want to include or differentiate against:

- **QuickBooks Online:** Provides an interactive cash flow planner that projects 30 days ahead by default using due dates on bills/invoices. It links to bank accounts for real-time balance updates. However, it’s limited in customization. Our tool will extend beyond 30 days and allow user input for scenarios.
- **Float:** Emphasizes scenario planning (“what if we hire 2 more people?”) by letting users toggle certain cash inflows/outflows. We plan a similar capability to simulate scenarios in our forecasting module.
- **PlanGuru:** Offers very long-term forecasting and consolidation of multiple entities. For our target users, long-term (5-10 year) forecasts might be overkill, but we note PlanGuru’s depth in budgeting by line item, something we incorporate by allowing detailed budgeting per category.
- **Pulse:** Simplicity – Pulse’s appeal is that a non-financial founder can quickly start tracking cash flow without accounting knowledge. We also strive for simplicity in setup (e.g., easy integration, templates for common recurring items) so that initial adoption is quick.
- **CashAnalytics:** Advanced features like direct vs indirect cash flow forecasting methods and integration with ERP. While we may not implement full direct/indirect cash flow statement options initially, we take inspiration on ensuring our calculations align with accounting principles so outputs are credible. We also note their target of multi-entity cash consolidation, which could be a future roadmap item for us (not in v1).
- **Google Sheets templates:** Flexibility is the key feature. Users can model anything. Our approach to counter this is providing enough flexibility (through customizable categories, the ability to add one-off adjustments in forecasts, and export capabilities) that users don’t feel constrained. Additionally, we turn a weakness of spreadsheets (lack of automation) into our strength by automating data updates and calculations.

### 3.4 Competitive Summary

In summary, our competitive landscape analysis reveals:

- **Strong demand for an integrated solution:** Many businesses desire a one-stop platform for cash flow (supported by survey data).
- **Dominance of incumbents in data ownership:** QuickBooks and others hold the data; partnering/integrating with them (rather than competing head-on as an accounting system) is wise. We add value on top of them.
- **Opportunity in user experience:** There’s room to differentiate by providing a user experience tailored to quick insights and ease of use, which neither spreadsheets (prone to error) nor large systems (prone to complexity) provide.
- **Need for trust and accuracy:** Because we deal with financial data, our product must be reliable and accurate to gain user trust. Competitors with established brands (like Intuit QuickBooks) have an advantage here, so we must establish credibility (perhaps via robust integration and possibly certifications like being an official QuickBooks App, and emphasizing security measures).

We will continue to monitor competitors and user feedback to iterate on our unique value propositions. Our goal is not only to match competitors feature-for-feature where necessary, but to innovate in areas that solve user problems more effectively than any existing solution.

## 4. User Personas and User Roles

To build a product that truly meets user needs, we must understand **who our users are** and the context in which they will use the application. This section outlines the primary user personas and the roles within the system that map to those personas.

### 4.1 Primary User Personas

**Persona 1: Small Business Owner (Steve)**

- **Background:** Steve owns a growing small business (e.g., a consulting agency). He does not have a full-time accountant; he manages finances himself or with a part-time bookkeeper. He’s tech-savvy in running his business but not a financial expert by training.
- **Goals:** Wants a clear view of whether his business will have enough cash to cover expenses in coming months. He needs to easily input expected income (new projects, customer payments) and expenses (salaries, rent) and see the impact on his cash balance. He also wants to streamline sending invoices to his clients and ensure he gets paid on time to maintain cash flow.
- **Pain Points:** Finds it cumbersome to use QuickBooks reports and then build separate Excel forecasts. Worried he might miss a looming cash shortfall or be late invoicing a client. Time is limited; he needs quick insights, not hours of number-crunching.
- **Behaviors:** Checks finances maybe weekly. Uses software like QuickBooks for bookkeeping. Comfortable with basic tools, but needs guidance for anything complex in forecasting or budgeting.

**Persona 2: Finance Manager / CFO of Mid-sized Company (Mary)**

- **Background:** Mary is a finance manager (or CFO) at a mid-sized company (\~100 employees). There is an accounting team handling bookkeeping in a system like NetSuite or SAP, but Mary is responsible for cash management, budgeting, and reporting to the CEO.
- **Goals:** Wants to optimize the company’s cash: ensure they are never in a cash crunch, and make sure excess cash is invested or used wisely. She prepares rolling 12-month cash forecasts and monitors actual vs budget monthly. She also coordinates with department heads on their spending.
- **Pain Points:** Existing ERP can produce financial statements but not flexible cash forecasts, so she exports data for analysis. The process is manual and doesn’t update automatically with new actuals. Coordination of budget inputs from different departments via spreadsheets is a headache. Also, consolidating multiple bank accounts and possibly multi-currency cash flows is challenging.
- **Behaviors:** Logs in daily to review cash position. Very detail-oriented. Needs granular control (e.g., adjusting forecast assumptions, drilling into transactions). Also concerned about controls/security (who can see what data, audit trails for changes).

**Persona 3: Accountant / Bookkeeper (Brian)**

- **Background:** Brian is a professional accountant or bookkeeper managing finances for one or multiple small businesses. He could be an in-house accountant or an external consultant.
- **Goals:** Ensure all financial data is recorded accurately. He’s interested in how this tool can save him time in reconciling cash flow with accounting records. He values integration so that he doesn’t have to double-enter data. He may also use the tool to provide better advisory service to the business owner by generating forecasts and what-if scenarios.
- **Pain Points:** Switching between software is inefficient for him. If the business owner uses spreadsheets he constantly worries about version mismatches or errors in those sheets. He also desires a way to schedule recurring entries (like monthly accruals) once and not worry about them each period.
- **Behaviors:** Uses accounting software heavily. Likely to be the one who sets up the integration between our app and QuickBooks/Xero. Might also set up initial categories or budgets for the client. Will check in perhaps weekly or monthly to update forecast or review actual vs projected.

**Persona 4: Product Manager / Business Analyst (Alice)** – _as an internal user of this PRD_

- **Background:** Alice is a product manager (or business analyst) at our company (the provider of this SaaS application). While not an end-user of the app, she is a persona for whom this PRD is tailored. She needs to translate market and user needs into a successful product.
- **Goals:** Ensure the product meets user needs, is technically feasible, and differentiates in the market. She coordinates among engineering, design, and stakeholders. She uses this PRD as a guide to make trade-off decisions and to keep the team aligned.
- **Responsibilities:** Not directly using the cash flow app’s features, but responsible for defining them. Ensures that the user stories and requirements truly address the pain points of Steve, Mary, Brian, etc.
- _(We include Alice here to remind that this document is written with product management perspective, ensuring business context and technical detail are balanced.)_

These personas will be referenced in user stories and help us make design decisions. For example, if a feature is very useful to Mary (CFO) but makes the UI more complex for Steve (small business owner), we might decide to hide that complexity behind an “advanced mode” setting or role permission. Our goal is to satisfy all personas by balancing simplicity and power.

### 4.2 User Roles and Permissions in the System

Within the application, we will implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage what different users can see and do. This not only supports the various personas above but also ensures security of sensitive data. RBAC is an approach to restrict system access only to authorized users with appropriate permissions. Below are the roles we anticipate and their typical permissions:

- **Owner / Admin:** This corresponds often to the business owner or CFO (Steve or Mary) who is the primary owner of the account (the person who set up the company on our platform).

  - _Permissions:_ Full access to all features and settings. Can invite/manage other users, assign roles, configure integrations (like connecting to QuickBooks API), and adjust any company-wide settings. Can view and edit all financial data (transactions, budgets, forecasts, invoices).
  - _Notes:_ There is typically at least one Admin per company account. Admins can also export or delete data, given they own the data.

- **Finance User / Editor:** This role maps to someone like an internal accountant or finance team member (Brian, or a junior analyst under Mary).

  - _Permissions:_ Able to view and modify financial data (add/edit transactions, create forecasts, budgets, invoices) but may have some restricted areas such as user management or deleting the entire account. They can input data and generate reports but might not authorize to change high-level settings.
  - _Notes:_ This role allows collaboration – multiple finance team members can work together. The Admin can trust these users to update data but perhaps only Admin can approve certain critical actions (like locking a budget or confirming a forecast version).

- **Viewer / Read-Only:** This could be assigned to roles like a department manager who wants to see reports, or an external advisor/investor who should monitor but not change data.

  - _Permissions:_ Can view dashboards, reports, and read the data, but cannot create or edit anything. They cannot add transactions or alter forecasts. This is ideal for stakeholders who need transparency (e.g., CEO, or a lender who’s been given access to monitor financial status) without risk of accidental changes.
  - _Notes:_ We might allow granular control, such as a Viewer could be restricted to see only certain data (e.g., only one department’s budget vs another) in future, but for v1, if someone is a viewer, they see all the company’s data in read-only mode.

- **Invoice-only Role (Accounts Receivable Clerk) – _Optional Role_**: Some companies have a person dedicated to invoicing and collections. We might have a narrower role for this persona.

  - _Permissions:_ Can create and send invoices, mark payments, and see which invoices are paid or outstanding. They might not have access to broader cash flow forecasts or the budgeting sections.
  - _Notes:_ This is a specialized editor role limited to AR tasks. Alternatively, we handle this by permissions on a feature basis.

- **External Accountant Role – _Optional_**: If a business’s accountant is external, they might be given access to help manage the system.

  - _Permissions:_ This could be similar to Finance User/Editor (full data access) but perhaps without the ability to invite new users (since they themselves are an invited external). Possibly an Admin might specifically mark an external accountant user so the system can log their activities separately for audit.
  - _Notes:_ We may not need a separate role if permissions are the same as an internal finance user, but we note the scenario because sometimes businesses might want to differentiate (for instance, revoking access when the engagement with the accountant ends).

**Role Management Features:**

- The system will allow an Admin to invite users by email, assign them one of the roles above, or change their role.
- The roles determine the navigation options and actions available. For example, a Viewer will see dashboards and reports but the “Add Transaction” button might be hidden/disabled for them.
- Only Admins can access integration settings (to connect QuickBooks, etc.) and critical configuration (like deleting a transaction permanently or adjusting organizational settings).
- All data changes (adds/edits/deletes of financial entries, changes in settings) should be logged with the user identity for audit purposes (important for security, discussed later). This audit log will also help Admins monitor what external accountants or editors are doing for trust.
- The default roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer as defined) cover common needs. We will consider in future allowing custom role configurations (for example, toggling permissions on specific modules per user), but for v1 a fixed role set simplifies implementation and user understanding.

**Mapping Personas to Roles:**

- Steve (Small Business Owner) is likely an **Admin** (full control). If Steve invites his part-time bookkeeper (Brian), he might give Brian an **Editor** role to update transactions and reconcile accounts.
- Mary (CFO) is an **Admin** (or maybe Editor if the CEO was the original Admin, but functionally she has full access). She might give her junior analyst an **Editor** role. Department heads might get **Viewer** roles to see their budget vs actual.
- Brian (Accountant) could be an **Editor** if internal, or an **Admin** if he’s essentially running the system for a client (or if the client trusts him as much as an Admin). If Brian is an external accountant, Steve might keep Admin and give Brian Editor rights.
- In all cases, at least one person in the company will have Admin rights to manage the account subscription and critical settings.

By establishing clear personas and roles, we ensure the application’s functionality can be tailored (via permissions and UI) to each type of user. This leads to a more secure and user-friendly experience: people see what they need and aren’t overwhelmed by or given access to features irrelevant to them.

## 5. User Stories

User stories describe the product’s features from an end-user’s perspective, highlighting the value each feature provides. They will guide the development of features to ensure they fulfill real user needs. Below is a collection of key user stories, grouped by major functional areas of the application:

### 5.1 Cash Flow Reporting & Analysis

- **As a small business owner (Steve), I want to see a summary of my cash inflows and outflows for the current month,** so that I can understand if my cash balance is increasing or decreasing and by how much.
- **As a CFO (Mary), I want to view a detailed report of all income sources and expense destinations for any given period,** so that I can identify major cash generators and consumers (e.g., top 5 customers, top 5 expense categories) and explain cash flow drivers to management.
- **As a user, I want to filter cash flow reports by account or category (e.g., view cash flow just for a specific bank account or just operational expenses),** so that I can drill down into specific aspects of my finances without distraction from other data.
- **As a finance manager, I want the ability to export a cash flow report to Excel or PDF,** so that I can share it with stakeholders (investors, board, or colleagues) or keep a snapshot for our records.
- **As an accountant, I want to drill down from a high-level report into the list of transactions that make up a number (for example, click on “Marketing Expenses \$5,000” and see the detailed items),** so that I can verify the correctness of data and have detail on hand for any questions.

### 5.2 Transaction Management (One-time & Recurring Entries)

- **As a user, I want to add a one-time cash inflow or outflow with details (date, amount, description, category),** so that I can include ad-hoc transactions (like an equipment purchase or a consulting income) in my cash flow plan that are not part of regular operations.
- **As a user, I want to set up a recurring expense (e.g., monthly rent or annual insurance premium) by entering it once with a recurrence rule,** so that the system automatically projects this expense into future periods and I don’t have to remember to re-enter it every time.
- **As a user, I want to edit or cancel a recurring transaction schedule,** so that if something changes (rent increases, or subscription canceled), I can keep my cash flow projections accurate going forward.
- **As a finance manager, I want to mark certain planned transactions as “confirmed” or actual once they happen (or import actuals from accounting),** so that I can compare what was forecast with what actually occurred, and adjust the future forecast accordingly.
- **As a user, I want to record a multi-part transaction (with multiple line items) – for example, a single customer payment that covers two invoices, or a payroll run that covers multiple employees – with each component categorized,** so that I have detailed documentation of complex transactions and can see line-item details in reports (this ensures detailed line items for each payment or deposit are captured, per requirements).
- **As an accountant, I want the system to generate automatic entries for recurring transactions at their due dates (posting them to the cash flow ledger),** so that my cash flow projections always include up-to-date recurring items without manual intervention, and I can see upcoming cash movements in the calendar or timeline.

### 5.3 Integration with Accounting Systems

- **As a user, I want to connect the application to my QuickBooks Online account via a secure authentication,** so that my existing chart of accounts and transaction data can be imported and kept in sync, eliminating duplicate data entry.
- **As an accountant, I want the system to automatically pull in new transactions from Xero daily,** so that my cash flow reports and forecasts are always based on the latest actual financial data without me manually importing each time.
- **As a user, I want to import historical data (e.g., last 2 years of transactions) from my accounting software during initial setup,** so that I can immediately generate historical cash flow reports and use that data for forecasting trends.
- **As a CFO, I want to map accounts from my accounting system to cash flow categories in the app if needed (for example, map several expense accounts into a single “Overhead Expenses” category),** so that the cash flow reports group data in a way that is meaningful to me.
- **As a user, I want to be notified if the integration fails or an import has errors (e.g., due to expired credentials or API errors),** so that I can promptly fix the connection and not lose out on up-to-date data.
- **As an accountant, I want the ability to perform a one-time import via CSV for systems that are not directly integrated (or for initial data load if API isn’t used),** so that even if an automated integration isn’t available, I can still get my data into the system.
- **As a user, I want to optionally push data from the cash flow app back to the accounting system (e.g., create a corresponding journal entry or invoice in QuickBooks for something I added in the app),** so that both systems remain consistent and I don’t have to update things twice (for initial version this may be limited, but user expresses desire for two-way sync).
- **As a system admin (technical persona), I want the integration to adhere to the accounting software’s permissions (e.g., read-only vs read-write),** so that connecting the app does not pose security or data integrity risks on the accounting side (ensuring least privilege in API usage).

### 5.4 Cash Flow Forecasting

- **As a business owner, I want to see a month-by-month projection of my cash balance for the next 12 months,** so that I can quickly identify if and when my cash might run out or when I’ll have excess to invest.
- **As a CFO, I want to create different forecast scenarios (e.g., optimistic, base, pessimistic) by adjusting assumptions such as sales growth or expense changes,** so that I can understand the range of possible outcomes and prepare contingency plans.
- **As a user, I want the system to automatically incorporate scheduled recurring transactions into the forecast,** so that regular expenses/incomes are accounted for without manual input in each forecast.
- **As a user, I want to add forecast-only items that aren’t in the accounting system yet (like a planned future loan or a potential new project income),** so that those potential cash events are included in my projection for better planning.
- **As a finance manager, I want to visualize the forecast in a graph (cash balance over time) and also see key metrics like the lowest projected balance and when it occurs,** so that I can easily communicate the forecast and pinpoint critical periods.
- **As an analyst, I want to compare the current forecast to the forecast from a prior month (or to the budget),** so that I can see how our outlook is improving or worsening over time and explain changes.
- **As a user, I want to quickly adjust a forecast by “dragging” a cash flow curve or editing a few top-line assumptions (for example, what if my receivables are delayed by 15 days on average?),** so that I can do quick what-if analysis during meetings without rebuilding the whole projection.
- **As an accountant, I want the forecast to clearly differentiate between confirmed actuals and projected figures (e.g., actuals up to last month, then forecast onwards),** so that I have confidence in where known data ends and assumptions begin, maintaining credibility of the report.

### 5.5 Budgeting and Variance Tracking

- **As a department manager, I want to set an annual or monthly budget for different expense categories (e.g., Marketing, Office Supplies, etc.),** so that I have spending targets to aim for and a plan for my portion of the cash flow.
- **As a CFO, I want to input a master budget or cash flow plan for the year (across all categories or a high-level plan of net cash flow),** so that I can compare actual cash flow against this plan and ensure we are on track with our financial strategy.
- **As a user, I want to see a report or dashboard of actual vs budget for each category each month, including the variance (difference),** so that I can quickly identify where we are overspending or underspending, and investigate why.
- **As a user, I want to receive an alert when actual spending in a category exceeds the budget by a certain threshold or when income falls short,** so that I can take corrective action in time (such as cutting discretionary expenses or boosting sales efforts).
- **As an accountant, I want to adjust budgets mid-year (reforecast or revise budgets) and keep versions (original budget, revised budget),** so that the tool reflects our latest plan if things changed (like we decided to spend more on marketing mid-year, I can update the budget).
- **As a user, I want to lock a budget after it’s approved,** so that further changes require a special action (preventing accidental modifications) – this is especially useful if multiple editors have access.
- **As a CFO, I want to consolidate budgets from different departments (if applicable) into an overall cash flow projection,** so that I can see the big picture for the company.
- **As a user, I want to export or print the budget vs actual reports for meetings,** so that I can discuss performance with the team or board with clear figures.

### 5.6 Invoice Management (Accounts Receivable)

- **As a business owner, I want to create an invoice for a customer by entering invoice details (customer, items or services, quantities, prices, due date),** so that I can bill my customers immediately and professionally through the system.
- **As a user, I want to send the invoice to the customer’s email directly from the application (with a PDF attachment or link),** so that I don’t have to download and send it manually, saving time and ensuring the invoice is sent out promptly.
- **As a user, I want to record when an invoice is paid (either by marking it paid when I receive a check or automatically if an online payment was made),** so that the system updates my cash flow to reflect that cash inflow and I can see which invoices remain outstanding.
- **As an AR clerk, I want the system to automatically reflect invoice due dates in the cash flow forecast (e.g., as expected inflows on those dates),** so that my cash forecast isn’t missing expected customer payments.
- **As a CFO, I want to see an **aging report** of invoices (which invoices are 0-30 days, 31-60 days, etc. overdue),** so that I can quickly identify late payers and follow up, improving collections. (This ties into cash flow by focusing on delayed inflows.)
- **As a user, I want to set up automatic payment reminders to clients for upcoming or overdue invoices,** so that I can increase the chances of timely payment without manually tracking each due date.
- **As an accountant, I want the invoices generated here to be synced or exported to our accounting system (if we choose, e.g., create a copy in QuickBooks),** so that our accounting books reflect these invoices and there’s no discrepancy between systems.
- **As a user, I want to accept online payments on invoices (e.g., via credit card or ACH) by integrating a payment gateway,** so that customers can pay immediately upon receiving the invoice, directly improving our cash inflow speed (note: this involves integration with payment services and is an optional feature; could be future scope, but the user story captures the aspiration).
- **As a user, I want to generate a receipt or confirmation once an invoice is paid (to send to the customer and for my records),** so that the process from invoicing to payment to acknowledgment is fully handled in one place.

### 5.7 User and Access Management

- **As an Admin, I want to invite a colleague to the platform by sending them an email invite,** so that we can collaboratively manage our cash flow (for example, invite our external accountant to help manage the data).
- **As an Admin, I want to assign a role (Admin, Editor, Viewer, etc.) to each invited user,** so that I can control who can modify data and who can only view data.
- **As an Admin, I want to change a user’s role or revoke access at any time,** so that if responsibilities change or someone leaves the company, I can ensure the appropriate level of access.
- **As a user, I want to securely log into the application (with email/password or SSO, and 2-factor authentication if enabled),** so that I can trust that our financial data is protected and only authorized people can access it.
- **As a user, I want to update my own profile information and preferences (like time zone, notification settings, etc.),** so that the application can personalize certain aspects (e.g., sending me a daily summary email, or showing dates in my local format).

### 5.8 Alerts and Notifications (related to multiple modules)

- **As a user, I want to receive a notification or see a warning in the dashboard if my projected cash balance is going to go negative in the next few weeks/months,** so that I am aware of a potential cash crunch well in advance and can take action (e.g., arrange a credit line or cut expenses).
- **As a user, I want to be notified when a large unexpected expense is recorded (above a certain threshold I define),** so that I can review it and see how it affects the cash flow.
- **As a user, I want to get an email reminder a few days before a recurring bill is due (or before payroll date, etc.),** so that I ensure funds are available and nothing is missed.
- **As a user, I want a summary notification (daily or weekly) of recent cash movements and upcoming significant items,** so that even if I don’t log in every day, I stay informed of my cash situation via email or mobile notification.

Each of these user stories will later be mapped to specific functional requirements in Section 6. They provide a narrative to ensure that when we design features, we remember the end-user’s perspective and the value the feature should deliver.

Next, we translate these stories into concrete requirements and specifications the system must fulfill.

## 6. Functional Requirements

This section lists the detailed functional requirements of the system, organized by feature modules. Each requirement is labeled (for reference) and described. The wording “the system shall…” is used to indicate a binding requirement.

### 6.1 Cash Flow Reports and Dashboards

**Overview:** The application shall provide core cash flow reports that summarize and detail how cash is coming in and going out. This includes visual dashboards and printable reports for different periods. The focus is on clarity of sources and uses of cash.

- **FR1.1 Summary Dashboard:** The system shall display a **Cash Flow Summary** on the main dashboard, showing key figures such as total cash inflows, total outflows, and net cash flow for the current period (e.g., month-to-date), as well as current cash balance across accounts. This summary should update in real time as new data comes in.
- **FR1.2 Income vs Expense Breakdown:** The system shall provide a visual breakdown (e.g., pie chart or bar chart) of income sources and expense categories for a selected period. For instance, a pie chart showing what percentage of outflows went to different categories (payroll, rent, etc.). This helps illustrate “expense destinations” clearly.

&#x20;_Example of an expense breakdown by category, helping users see where their cash is going in a given period._

- **FR1.3 Detailed Cash Flow Statement:** The system shall generate a detailed cash flow report for any user-specified date range (e.g., last week, last month, last quarter). This report will list beginning cash balance, categorized cash inflows, categorized cash outflows, and ending cash balance for the period, effectively mirroring a cash flow statement. The categories should roll-up (e.g., all types of revenues summed under “Total Inflows”, main expense categories under “Total Outflows”). It should also be clear which items are actual vs forecast if the period extends into future dates.
- **FR1.4 Transaction Drill-down:** For any summary line in the cash flow report (e.g., “Marketing Expenses: \$5,000”), the system shall allow the user to drill down to see the list of individual transactions that constitute that number. This can be via an expand/collapse in the report or a clickable link that opens a detail view. Each transaction detail will show date, description, amount, and source/destination (e.g., vendor or customer name if available).
- **FR1.5 Custom Date Ranges and Frequency:** The system shall allow users to view cash flow data by different frequencies – monthly, weekly, or daily. For example, a user could request a week-by-week cash flow for the next 8 weeks, or a monthly view for the last 6 months. The reports should aggregate data accordingly. Additionally, custom date range selection (start and end date) should be supported for flexibility.
- **FR1.6 Category and Account Filters:** The system shall provide filters to narrow the report by specific criteria. At minimum, filters for:

  - **Category/Tag filter:** e.g., show only cash flow related to a particular project or category.
  - **Account filter:** e.g., show cash flow for a specific bank account or subset of accounts (if the user wants to isolate, say, their primary bank vs a secondary account).
  - **Business unit filter (future, if multi-entity):** e.g., if a company has multiple divisions being tracked.
    These filters help users answer specific questions (like “How much cash did our event project generate/spend?”).

- **FR1.7 Export and Print:** The system shall allow users to export cash flow reports to common formats (PDF for a nicely formatted report, Excel/CSV for data further analysis). Exported reports should preserve the structure (including any breakdowns shown) and ideally include the company name, report title, date range, and generation timestamp for auditing. A print-friendly format should also be available (could be same as PDF).
- **FR1.8 Comparative Reporting:** The system should (if data is available) allow comparing two periods side by side. For example, showing Q1 vs Q2 cash flows, or this month vs same month last year. This helps in analyzing trends or seasonality. _If not in v1, this is a nice-to-have that could be delivered later or via exporting data._
- **FR1.9 Key Metrics Highlight:** The report or dashboard shall highlight key metrics such as:

  - Largest single inflow and largest single outflow in the period.
  - Average monthly net cash flow (for multi-month views).
  - Current cash burn rate (if negative net flow) or growth rate (if positive).
    These highlights give context (e.g., “Your cash is decreasing at an average of \$5k per month”).

- **FR1.10 Real-time Update:** If new transactions are added or imported (via integration) while the user is viewing the dashboard, the system shall update the relevant figures in near-real-time (within a few seconds) to reflect the changes. This ensures the report is always up to date. (Technical note: implement via live data binding or refresh prompts.)
- **FR1.11 Error Handling in Reports:** If there is missing data or integration delay (for example, the latest bank balance isn’t fetched), the report should clearly indicate it (like “data as of \[date]” or warnings if certain accounts are not included). We must avoid silent inaccuracies.

By fulfilling these requirements, the **Cash Flow Reports** module will meet the need of showing income sources and expense destinations clearly, addressing the core ask for transparency of cash movement. The inclusion of a drill-down and breakdown satisfies the need for detailed line item visibility for each payment and deposit. The ability to filter and export adds flexibility for various business uses.

### 6.2 Transaction Management (One-Time and Recurring Entries)

**Overview:** This module covers how users input and manage cash flow items. Transactions can be one-off or recurring. Each transaction potentially has multiple line items for detail. Managing these effectively is crucial for accurate cash flow tracking and projections.

- **FR2.1 Add One-Time Transaction:** The system shall provide a form to add a new one-time transaction (money in or out). Required fields: Date, Amount, Type (inflow or outflow), Category, Description/Notes. Additional optional fields: Counterparty (e.g., vendor or customer name), Reference (invoice number or bill ID if applicable). Upon saving, this transaction is recorded in the system and immediately reflected in reports and forecasts.
- **FR2.2 Recurring Transaction Setup:** The system shall allow the user to mark a transaction as recurring. This includes setting:

  - Recurrence frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, custom – such as every 2 weeks).
  - Recurrence end (no end/open-ended, end after N occurrences, or end by a certain date).
  - Next occurrence date (start date) and optionally the last occurrence date or total occurrences if not indefinite.
  - Optionally, differentiate if needed between **fixed amount** recurring (same amount each time) vs **variable** (user plans to adjust each occurrence’s amount later) – but likely assume fixed for simplicity in v1.
    The system shall then automatically generate the series of transactions based on this template. For example, if a \$5000 payroll is set for the 25th of every month, the system will list those entries on each 25th going forward in the forecast.

- **FR2.3 Recurring Transaction Listing:** The system shall provide a view where all recurring transactions are listed with their schedule details. Users can see at a glance what recurring items exist (e.g., “Office Rent – \$2,000 – monthly on 1st of month – Next due: June 1, 2025”) and their status (active/inactive).
- **FR2.4 Edit Recurring Transaction:** The system shall allow editing the details of a recurring transaction series. Editing options:

  - Change amount (for all future occurrences, or just one occurrence).
  - Change schedule (frequency, next date, etc.).
  - Add or edit line item details (e.g., split of that recurring expense if needed).
    If a user edits a series, the system should update all future occurrences (keeping past ones unchanged if they were already realized).

- **FR2.5 Cancel/End Recurring Transaction:** The system shall allow the user to end a recurring series (either immediately or after a certain date). For example, if a subscription is canceled effective August, the user can end the recurring entry in July. The system will not generate occurrences beyond that end date. The user can also delete a recurring series entirely, which would remove any future-scheduled instances (with a warning if any already occurred entries might also be affected).
- **FR2.6 Detailed Line Items for Transactions:** The system shall support transactions with multiple line items. This is useful when one payment covers multiple purposes. For instance:

  - An outflow transaction “Employee Salaries April” for \$50,000 might have sub-line: \$30,000 for Engineering team salaries, \$20,000 for Sales team salaries.
  - An inflow “Customer Payment” \$10,000 might be split: \$6,000 for Project A, \$4,000 for Project B.
    Users should be able to add line items under a transaction with fields: line description, line amount, (possibly line category if they want to categorize sub-components differently). The sum of line items should equal the total transaction amount (the system can enforce or auto-calc the total).

- **FR2.7 Transaction Classification (Category/Tags):** Each transaction (or each line item) shall be classified by a category (or multiple tags if we allow). Categories might include predefined ones (Sales, Investment Income, Loan Proceeds for inflow; Payroll, Rent, Utilities, Loan Payment for outflow, etc.) and allow custom categories. This classification feeds reports (so sources/destinations are clear) and budgeting. The system should ship with a default chart of categories which can be customized.
- **FR2.8 Attachments/Notes:** (Optional, nice-to-have) The system could allow attaching a small note or file to a transaction (e.g., a PDF of a receipt or invoice linked to that cash transaction). For v1, we can allow text notes field (for internal reference), with file attachment possibly later if demand.
- **FR2.9 Bulk Import/Entry:** The system shall allow multiple transactions to be added at once for efficiency. This could be done via:

  - A CSV import (which ties into integration, but a manual import option).
  - A quick-entry grid where a user can add several items line by line without reopening a form each time.
    This is especially useful at the end of month when entering several planned items or adjusting forecasts.

- **FR2.10 Actual vs Projected Flag:** The system shall internally mark transactions as either “actual” or “projected.”

  - Transactions that come from the accounting integration or that are dated in the past (today or earlier) are actual (and can be considered in historical reports).
  - Transactions dated in the future or manually entered as future events are projected.
  - If an actual comes in that overlaps a projected (for example, user projected a client would pay \$5k on Oct 10, but in reality they paid \$4.5k on Oct 12), the system should ideally reconcile or at least signal the discrepancy. (The exact handling can be user-driven: maybe user marks the projected as realized with actual amount).

- **FR2.11 Transaction Edit & Delete:** The system shall allow editing or deleting of any manually-entered transaction (with appropriate permissions). If a transaction originates from integration, editing might be restricted or at least warned (because the source of truth is external). Possibly allow adjusting forecast entries but not actual imported ones (or if adjusting, it might become a “manual override”). If an imported transaction is deleted or edited, we should note it to avoid it re-importing or confusing data sync.
- **FR2.12 Recurring to Actual Conversion:** When a date passes, any recurring transaction that was projected for that date should ideally be marked as due/occurred. The system shall provide a mechanism to confirm that it did happen as planned or adjust it. For example, “Rent due Jan 1 \$2000 – mark as paid?” If integrated with accounting (say the actual payment is recorded there), the system could auto-match and mark it paid. This ensures our forecast doesn’t count something twice (both in projection and actual).
- **FR2.13 Calendar View:** (Optional UI feature) The system could present a calendar interface showing transactions on a calendar, especially recurring ones, to give a visual timeline of cash events. This is more interface, but facilitated by underlying data.
- **FR2.14 Multi-currency handling:** If applicable, the system should handle if transactions are in different currencies (for example, if a business has a USD account and a EUR account). At minimum, for v1 we might restrict to a single base currency (set at company setup) to avoid complexity. But if multi-currency, we’d need FX rates and show totals in base currency. (Marking as future feature unless high priority for target users).
- **FR2.15 Opening Balances:** The system shall allow setting an opening cash balance for the start of the planning horizon (likely derived from bank accounts or user input). This initial balance combined with transactions yields the running balance. Users should be able to adjust or set that starting point (especially when first onboarding, e.g., “Today’s cash on hand = \$X”).

These transaction management requirements ensure that users can input both one-time events and repetitive cash flow items with ease and precision. Recurring transaction support is explicitly required (and is a major feature for usability). The inclusion of detailed line items addresses the requirement of capturing detail for each payment/deposit beyond a single summary amount. Moreover, by linking actual vs projected, we are preparing the ground for meaningful forecasts and comparisons.

### 6.3 Integration with External Accounting Systems

**Overview:** Integration is a key feature that connects our application with widely used accounting solutions (QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, SAP). The aim is to import relevant financial data (primarily transactions that affect cash) and possibly export data back. This saves time and ensures consistency between systems.

- **FR3.1 Supported Systems & Authentication:** The system shall support integration at least with QuickBooks Online and Xero in the initial release (as these are most common among SMBs). It shall use the official APIs provided by these platforms. For authentication:

  - QuickBooks: use OAuth 2.0 flow to get permission to read (and possibly write) data via Intuit’s API.
  - Xero: use Xero’s OAuth 2.0 for API access.
  - NetSuite/SAP: These are more complex; likely initial support might be via export/import rather than real-time API (NetSuite has APIs but often requires more setup). Possibly out-of-the-box integration with NetSuite could be a later feature or done via middleware. For v1, we assume QuickBooks and Xero direct integration, while NetSuite/SAP may be manual import or pilot basis.

- **FR3.2 Data to Import:** The integration shall import the following data from the connected accounting system:

  - **Chart of Accounts / Categories:** So that we know what accounts exist (especially to map categories and possibly to allow user to select which accounts correspond to cash flow relevant items).
  - **Transactions:** Specifically, all cash-related transactions. This includes payments made (expenses, bills paid), payments received (customer payments, receipts), transfers between bank accounts, etc. Ideally, we fetch any transaction that affects the bank or cash accounts in the accounting system. For QuickBooks, for example, this could mean querying the “Bank Transactions” or using the general ledger entries filtered by cash accounts.
  - **Invoices and Bills:** Optionally import open invoices (accounts receivable) and bills (accounts payable) if we want to include those in cash flow forecast (e.g., an open bill due next month would be a projected outflow if not paid yet). This might be an advanced capability. At minimum, pulling paid invoices (which are essentially income transactions) and paid bills (expenses) which reflect already occurred cash flows.
  - **Balances:** Current bank account balances (which may be derived from accounting or from the last reconciliation in accounting software) to verify starting cash on hand.

- **FR3.3 Import Frequency:** The system shall support both manual and automatic syncing:

  - **Manual Sync:** User can click “Sync now” to fetch latest data on demand.
  - **Auto Sync:** The system shall perform an automatic data sync periodically (e.g., every night or more frequently like every 4-6 hours, depending on API limits and importance of real-time data). This ensures the app stays up-to-date without user intervention.

- **FR3.4 Initial Data Import (Backfill):** Upon connecting an account, the system shall allow importing historical data (e.g., last 1-2 years or a selectable date range). Many forecasting tools recommend using at least 6-12 months of historical data for trends, and indeed users want to see some history in the app immediately. We may limit how far back to import by default (for performance, maybe 1 year by default, with an option to get more).
- **FR3.5 Data Mapping and Duplicate Handling:** The system should intelligently map data from external sources to our internal structures:

  - For example, QuickBooks might have categories/accounts that we map to our cash flow categories. We might let the user adjust mapping if needed (e.g., QuickBooks “Meals & Entertainment” account should map to “Office Expenses” category in our app if they prefer).
  - Avoiding duplicates: If a transaction was imported and the user also manually entered it, the system should recognize duplicates (perhaps by unique IDs from the source or matching amount+date+name) and not double-count. We shall have a strategy to either ignore duplicates or merge them. Possibly flag them for user review (“This transaction seems to already exist as a manual entry. Link them?”).

- **FR3.6 Two-way Sync (if applicable):** Initially, our focus is reading data to inform our cash flow app. However, some integration may push data back:

  - For instance, if the user creates an invoice in our system, we might want to create that invoice in QuickBooks as well for accounting consistency (if the user enables that).
  - If the user records a new transaction in our app that is actually a real transaction (not just a projection), perhaps offer to write it to QuickBooks as a Journal Entry or such.
  - Given complexities, for v1, we likely implement one-way (import) for most data, with perhaps selective push (like invoices).
  - **Requirement:** The system _may_ allow exporting certain entries to the accounting system. If so, user control is needed (e.g., a checkbox “also create in QuickBooks”). This is a nice-to-have that can differentiate us, but it must be carefully managed to not create duplicates or mess up books.

- **FR3.7 Integration Settings & Control:** The system shall provide an **Integration Settings** page where:

  - The user can see which accounting system is connected (and manage multiple connections if we allow more than one, e.g., multiple QuickBooks companies or a QuickBooks + a Xero concurrently if needed).
  - The user can refresh tokens or reconnect if needed.
  - The user can specify preferences, such as “Auto import new invoices as projected inflows” or “Only import transactions from these accounts \[list]” if they want partial sync.
  - Provide logs of last sync time and summary (e.g., “100 transactions imported, 2 invoices updated”).

- **FR3.8 Error Handling & Notifications:** If an integration fails (due to auth issues, rate limits, API downtime), the system shall:

  - Display a clear message in the app (in the integration settings or dashboard alert).
  - Potentially email the user (especially the Admin) if an auto-sync fails, so they are aware and can re-authenticate if necessary.
  - Not silently stop syncing; need to prompt user to fix it.

- **FR3.9 Security of Integration:** The system shall handle API credentials securely:

  - Use OAuth tokens, do not store user passwords for external systems.
  - Encrypt any refresh tokens or keys we store in our database.
  - Adhere to privacy: only retrieve data necessary for cash flow (don’t pull unnecessary personal data).
  - The user should be able to revoke access easily (via our app and via their accounting app).

- **FR3.10 Audit Trail:** For compliance, log what data was pulled when and if any data was pushed/modified in the external system by our app. This helps troubleshooting (e.g., if user says “numbers don’t match QuickBooks”, we can see what was imported).
- **FR3.11 Extensibility for Other Systems:** The design should allow adding other integrations in the future (like a plugin architecture or at least a service layer that could accommodate new APIs). For example, adding Sage or FreshBooks integration later should fit into the same pattern. This is more of a design guideline (NFR-ish), but mentioning to ensure we don’t hardcode logic only for QBO/Xero making extension hard.
- **FR3.12 Testing Mode/Sample Data:** Possibly provide a demo or testing mode by loading sample accounting data if a user doesn’t connect an integration (so that they can see how the app works with data). While not an integration per se, it’s a fallback to improve initial UX for those who might want to try the app before connecting their books.

By implementing these integration requirements, we address the part of the prompt about integrating with QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, SAP. QuickBooks and Xero will be the focus (covering a large portion of SMB market); we note that QuickBooks has \~85% small-business accounting market share, underscoring the importance of that integration. The ultimate goal is to **eliminate the need for double data entry** and to provide a near real-time reflection of the company’s financial reality inside our cash flow app. This significantly enhances the value proposition (saving time and avoiding errors).

### 6.4 Cash Flow Forecasting Module

**Overview:** Forecasting uses historical and scheduled data to project future cash flows. It’s a core piece that distinguishes this app by providing forward-looking insights. This module will allow creation of forecasts, scenario analysis, and visualization.

- **FR4.1 Automatic Baseline Forecast:** The system shall automatically generate a baseline cash flow forecast for a default future period (e.g., 12 months ahead, or 52 weeks ahead) using existing data:

  - Starting from the last actual cash balance.
  - Incorporating all recurring transactions scheduled in the future.
  - Using historical averages or trends for variable components if possible (e.g., average monthly sales or seasonality).
  - If no special configuration is done, the user should still see a forecast graph that assumes status quo (flat or based on known items).

- **FR4.2 Create Custom Forecast Scenario:** The system shall allow users to create and save custom forecast scenarios. For each scenario, the user can adjust assumptions or add/remove forecast entries without affecting other scenarios. For example, Scenario A (normal case), Scenario B (pessimistic: 10% drop in sales), Scenario C (optimistic: new funding received).

  - Users should be able to name scenarios and perhaps mark one as the “primary” or default for dashboard display.

- **FR4.3 Forecast Adjustments – Assumption Inputs:** The system shall provide an interface for high-level adjustments:

  - Growth/decline rates: e.g., “project revenue to grow 5% MoM” or “expenses to increase 2% per quarter”.
  - Payment timings: e.g., “assume customers pay 15 days late on average” (which would shift inflow timing).
  - One-off events: e.g., “add one-time expense of \$50k in December for equipment purchase” or “assume a loan inflow of \$100k in July”.
  - The interface could be a form or sliders that affect the projection.

- **FR4.4 Incorporating Historical Patterns:** (Advanced, possibly future) The system should analyze historical cash flow patterns to refine the forecast. For example, if every January has low sales and March has high, the forecast might reflect that seasonality. While complex, an initial approach might allow the user to choose: use last year’s same-month value for this year’s forecast of that month if applicable. This might not be in v1 except as simple year-over-year repetition or moving average logic.
- **FR4.5 Forecast Outputs:** The system shall present forecast results in multiple formats:

  - **Chart:** A line chart of cash balance over time (with today as the starting point), extending through the forecast horizon. It should clearly indicate historical vs forecast (e.g., solid line for actual, dashed for forecast). Key points like where the lowest balance occurs could be highlighted.

  &#x20;_Illustrative cash balance forecast chart. The blue line shows historical actual balances; the orange dashed line projects future balances based on current data and assumptions._

  - **Table:** A table view by period (month/week) listing starting balance, total inflows, total outflows, net flow, ending balance for each period in the forecast. This looks like a projected cash flow statement.
  - **Summary Insights:** e.g., “Lowest cash point is -\$5,000 on Oct 15, 2025” (indicating a potential deficit), or “Maximum cash balance of \$200k on Jul 1, 2025 if forecast holds”.

- **FR4.6 Forecast Horizon Configurable:** The system shall allow the user to define how far out to forecast (within reasonable limits). Options might include 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months. Default to 12. Longer horizons yield less accuracy but some users (like strategic planning) may want 2-3 years with broad strokes. We should impose a practical limit (maybe 5 years max, with caveat of uncertainty).
- **FR4.7 What-If Scenarios (Transactional Level):** In addition to high-level assumptions, users might want to tweak specific items:

  - e.g., Remove or delay a particular planned expense in the scenario (“What if we don’t buy that new equipment?”).
  - e.g., Increase a particular recurring revenue starting a certain date (“What if we sign a big new contract adding \$10k revenue monthly from July?”).
    The system shall allow adding or editing forecast-only transactions in a scenario. These scenario-specific entries won’t affect the main data unless the user decides to commit them.

- **FR4.8 Comparison of Scenarios:** The system shall allow users to compare two scenarios on the same chart or in the same table:

  - For example, overlay two forecast lines (perhaps color-coded) to see how optimistic vs pessimistic scenarios diverge.
  - Or show side-by-side tables or a delta (difference) view for each period.
    This helps in decision making (like best vs worst case analysis).

- **FR4.9 Integration of Budgets:** If the budgeting module is used, the system can overlay or incorporate budget targets into the forecast. For instance, if a user has a budget for monthly expenses, the forecast might default to those budgeted values for future months rather than pure historical extrapolation. Essentially, budgets could serve as another input to forecasting.

  - At minimum, we should visually indicate budget vs forecast difference if both exist (e.g., a line for forecast and a line for budget, or a bar of budget to compare).

- **FR4.10 Forecast Updates with Actuals:** As time passes and actual data comes in, the system shall update forecasts.

  - There should be an easy way to “re-forecast” or roll the forecast forward. Perhaps each scenario can be “updated with actuals” automatically: e.g., once January is over, the January forecast amount is replaced with actual and the rest of the forecast remains for Feb-Dec.
  - The system might also provide version control: being able to see what the forecast looked like last month vs now (to track changes). That might be advanced, but a single scenario could have snapshots.

- **FR4.11 Save/Print Forecast Reports:** Users shall be able to export forecast charts and tables for presentations. Likely similar to reports, but for future data. Possibly generate a PDF “Cash Flow Forecast Report for FY2025” which includes assumptions summary and the projected cash flow statement.
- **FR4.12 Handling Uncertainty:** While exact probabilities are beyond scope, we might include a feature to do simple sensitivity:

  - For example, allow user to specify a confidence range (like ±10% on all cash flows) and then show a shaded area on chart (best vs worst case band). If not in v1, at least keep in mind future enhancements for risk analysis.

- **FR4.13 User Guidance:** Because not all users (Steve, for example) are forecasting experts, the system should provide guidance/tips. For example:

  - A step-by-step “Forecast Setup Wizard” for first-time use, asking things like “Do you expect your sales to grow, shrink, or stay the same? By roughly what percent?” and filling assumptions.
  - Tooltips explaining terms (like what is inflow/outflow, what does optimistic scenario mean).
  - Perhaps suggestions: “Based on an uptick last quarter, consider increasing next quarter’s sales by X% in your forecast” (this could be future AI features).

- **FR4.14 Performance for Forecast Calculation:** The system must handle computing forecasts for potentially a lot of data points (if daily granularity for a year = 365 points). It should do so efficiently, perhaps caching recurring items rather than recalculating each time. The UI should display a loading indicator if a complex forecast is being generated, to manage user expectation.
- **FR4.15 Reconciliation of Forecast:** The forecast view should clearly reconcile with current actual data. For example, the starting point of the forecast (say today’s balance) should match what’s in the reports as current cash. If not, the user needs to know to adjust something. Possibly display “Starting cash balance for forecast: \$XYZ as of \[date]” at the top.

Meeting these requirements will fulfill the need to _“use historical transaction data to project future cash flow”_. It also empowers the user to do scenario planning, which is a huge value add beyond just seeing current status. As noted, cash flow forecasting is a critical tool for businesses to plan finances. Our forecasting module aims to make that tool accurate and easy to use, turning raw data into actionable foresight.

### 6.5 Budgeting Module

**Overview:** The budgeting module lets users set financial goals or limits (budgets) and compare actual performance against those plans. This ties into cash flow by putting a planned framework around inflows and outflows, and by providing another reference point for forecasts.

- **FR5.1 Create Budget:** The system shall provide the ability to create a budget for a particular period. This could be done in two ways (or a combination):

  - **Top-down Budget:** High-level net cash flow budget (total expected inflows and outflows per month/quarter).
  - **Detailed Category Budget:** Budget by category or account (e.g., Sales revenue budget = \$100k for Q1, Marketing expense budget = \$20k for Q1, etc.).
    We should support category-level budgeting as it’s more granular and useful to pinpoint variances.

- **FR5.2 Budget Periods:** The system shall allow budgets to be defined for standard fiscal periods:

  - Annual budget broken into monthly or quarterly segments (common approach: an annual number with monthly breakdown).
  - Or directly a monthly budget for each month.
  - The user should choose the fiscal year or start date of budget and number of periods. E.g., “FY2025 Budget – covers Jan 2025 to Dec 2025”.

- **FR5.3 Budget Input UI:** The system shall provide a budgeting interface (could be tabular, like a spreadsheet format, listing categories in rows and months in columns) for users to enter budgeted amounts. Ideally:

  - Pre-populate with either last year’s actuals or allow user to copy from previous year as a starting point.
  - Provide simple tools like fill across (repeat same value each month) or spread an annual total evenly or proportionally.
  - Categories can be collapsible (if hierarchical). But if we keep categories flat, just list each relevant category.
  - Also allow budgeting total inflows and total outflows at top level, for users who only care about net or high-level numbers.

- **FR5.4 Saving and Versions:** The system shall allow saving a budget and possibly marking it as “Approved” or final. If changes are needed later, we might allow creating a new version or revising it (maintaining an original copy).

  - A versioning approach: Budget 1 (initial), Budget 2 (revised mid-year) for same period. Or an easier approach: just edit it (but keep history if possible).
  - For simplicity, perhaps one active budget at a time per period, with ability to archive older.

- **FR5.5 Actual vs Budget Reports:** For any period where a budget exists and actual data (or forecast data) exists, the system shall produce a **Budget vs Actual** comparison:

  - By category: e.g., show budgeted vs actual expense for each category for the month of April, and the variance (difference or percentage).
  - Summaries: total income budget vs actual, total expense budget vs actual, net cash budget vs actual.
  - Possibly cumulative YTD comparisons as well (e.g., Jan-Apr budget vs actual).
  - Graphical: a bar chart for each category showing side by side actual and budget can quickly highlight variances.
  - This addresses part of showing where cash went vs where we thought it would go.

- **FR5.6 Forecast vs Budget:** The system shall allow users to compare the current forecast to the budget as well. This is essentially a projection of whether they will meet the budget by year-end if current trends continue. This could be integrated into the forecasting module or the budget module:

  - For example, at month mid, forecast year-end cash out vs budgeted cash out could show if we expect to be over/under budget.
  - Or for each category, forecasted total vs budget.

- **FR5.7 Alerts on Budget Variance:** The system shall support user-defined thresholds to trigger alerts (as mentioned in user stories):

  - E.g., alert if any month’s expenses exceed budget by >10% or \$X.
  - Alert if cumulative variance crosses a threshold.
  - These alerts can appear on dashboard or email to relevant users (like Admin or the person responsible).

- **FR5.8 Drill-down on Variance:** In the budget vs actual report, the system shall allow clicking on a variance to see underlying transactions causing the variance. For example, if “Marketing – Budget \$5,000, Actual \$8,000, Variance -\$3,000”, clicking might show the transactions (actual marketing spends) that made it \$8,000 (maybe an unplanned event sponsorship etc.).
- **FR5.9 Editable Budget Periods During Year:** The system shall allow updating budget for remaining periods without changing past actuals, of course. If a company reforecasts, they might want to adjust budgets for the rest of the year. We must decide how to handle that (either by making a new version or just editing forward months).
- **FR5.10 Multiple Budgets (if needed for multiple scenarios):** Some might have scenarios in budgets too (like best case budget, worst case budget). This might be overkill. Possibly handle via the forecasting scenario rather than multiple budgets. So likely one official budget at a time.
- **FR5.11 Collaboration & Comments:** (Nice-to-have) The budgeting interface could allow comments or notes on line items (e.g., “Why is travel budget high in May? – because of conference X”). Useful for memory and teamwork, though not critical for v1.
- **FR5.12 Locking:** Once a budget is final, an Admin might lock it so only Admin can change it (prevent accidental edits by others). This ties with roles/permissions.
- **FR5.13 Import/Export Budgets:** For users who prepared a budget in Excel or another system, provide a way to import it (CSV with Category, Jan-Dec values, etc.). Similarly, allow exporting the budget data out.
- **FR5.14 Budgeting for Non-cash items (info only):** Some budgets include non-cash items (like depreciation) but since our focus is cash, we likely will keep budgets to cash items (and mention to ignore non-cash or treat them separately).
- **FR5.15 Departmental Budgets:** If the product will be used in a larger org, they might set budgets per department. We haven’t explicitly modeled departments, but categories could serve as proxy (like categorize expenses by department). Alternatively, if we have a field for “department” on transactions, budgets could be by department. However, that complicates data model beyond v1 scope likely. We can note as future extension (to allow filters in budget vs actual by department, etc., aligning with possible user roles by department).

These budgeting requirements ensure the app isn’t just reactive but also helps in planning and target-setting. Many cash flow apps skip budgeting, but including it ties directly to helping users manage to their plan, which is valuable. By comparing budget vs actual, users can course-correct, which is part of proactive cash management. It complements forecasting (forecast is what you think will happen, budget is what you want to happen – seeing both is powerful).

### 6.6 Invoice Management (Accounts Receivable)

**Overview:** The invoice management module overlaps with accounts receivable and directly influences cash inflows. It’s a related component that can feed cash flow (through expected and actual receipts). The aim is to let users manage outgoing invoices (to customers) and track payments.

- **FR6.1 Create Invoice:** The system shall allow the user to create a new invoice. Key fields:

  - Invoice number (auto-generated sequentially, but allow override if needed to match an existing scheme).
  - Invoice date (default today) and due date (computed based on payment terms, e.g., net 30, but editable).
  - Bill-to: Customer name and contact info (address, email). The system should maintain a list of customers for reuse.
  - Line items: description, quantity, rate, amount (and calculate line total, invoice total, possibly tax if needed).
  - Terms/Notes: e.g., payment instructions, thank you note.
  - The invoice form should calculate totals and allow tax or discount lines if in scope (maybe simple for v1, e.g., an optional sales tax percentage).
  - Save draft or finalize.

- **FR6.2 Invoice Sending:** Upon finalizing, the user can send the invoice to the customer. The system shall:

  - Generate a PDF of the invoice in a professional template (including company logo if provided, invoice details).
  - Send an email to the customer’s email with that PDF attached or a secure link to view/pay the invoice online (if we implement an online payment page).
  - Track that it was sent and when (store timestamp, maybe mark invoice status as Sent).

- **FR6.3 Invoice Status Tracking:** The system shall track statuses for each invoice:

  - Draft (if created but not sent yet).
  - Sent (sent to customer).
  - Viewed (if we track that via an online link).
  - Partially Paid (if partial payments allowed and recorded).
  - Paid (fully paid).
  - Overdue (past due date and not fully paid).
    These statuses can be automatically updated (e.g., move to Overdue if current date > due date and not paid).

- **FR6.4 Record Payment:** The system shall allow recording of payments against an invoice:

  - If integrated with accounting or a payment gateway, this might be automatic (like an online payment will mark it as paid).
  - Otherwise, user can go into an invoice and click “Mark as Paid” or “Add Payment” with details (date, amount, method, maybe reference #).
  - Support partial payments: e.g., invoice \$1000, a payment of \$600 recorded, invoice remains with balance \$400 (Partially Paid status). Another payment later can close it.
  - Once fully paid, invoice status = Paid and a payment date is recorded.

- **FR6.5 Cash Flow Integration:** Paid invoices should automatically become cash inflow transactions in the cash flow ledger (if not already). Unpaid (open) invoices should optionally reflect in the forecast as expected inflows on their due dates:

  - For example, if an invoice of \$5k is due in 30 days, the forecast could include a \$5k inflow on that date. We should allow toggling this behavior (some may prefer to forecast more conservatively, but by default expecting due = actual receive might be okay, or maybe a setting “assume X days delay on invoice payments in forecast”).

- **FR6.6 Invoice List & Aging:** The system shall provide an **Invoice List** view showing all invoices with key info (number, customer, amount, due date, status, balance due). This list should be filterable (e.g., show unpaid only, or by customer).

  - It shall also provide an **Aging Report** which groups unpaid invoices by how late they are: current, 1-30 days overdue, 31-60, etc., as per standard AR aging format. This helps identify problematic receivables.

- **FR6.7 Reminders:** The system shall support sending payment reminders:

  - Automatically: e.g., an email reminder to customer 3 days before due, on due date, and if overdue X days (with customizable schedule perhaps).
  - Or manually: user clicks “Send Reminder” on an invoice to email the customer a friendly nudge with the invoice attached again.
  - Track that reminders were sent in invoice history.

- **FR6.8 Customer Management:** There should be a basic customer directory:

  - Add/Edit customer info (name, billing address, email, default payment terms).
  - See all invoices for a particular customer (customer statement).
  - Possibly link to the accounting system’s customer list (if integrated, sync customers as well to avoid re-entry).

- **FR6.9 Online Payment (Stretch Goal):** If we integrate with a payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.), the system could include a “Pay Now” link on invoices:

  - Customer can pay by credit card or bank transfer.
  - The system processes via gateway (likely we won’t store card info, just redirect to a secure form).
  - On success, mark invoice paid. Possibly charge a fee or integrate with user’s merchant account.
    This is a big feature beyond core, so might be planned as future addition. For now, we focus on tracking.

- **FR6.10 Integration with Accounting for Invoices:** If the user’s accounting system also handles invoices (like QuickBooks does), we need to avoid double-entry:

  - Option 1: The user chooses to manage invoices in our app, and those get pushed to QuickBooks as well (via API). Or
  - Option 2: If they already create invoices in QuickBooks, we simply import them as read-only and track status via QuickBooks.
    We likely implement Option 2 initially (import open invoices from QuickBooks, show them in our list as synced items you can’t edit fully, but you can mark them paid which might feed back). Or skip importing invoices if user plans to use our module exclusively.
  - **Requirement:** The system shall allow either local invoice management or integrate with external – this might be a setting when connecting QuickBooks like “Use QuickBooks for invoicing” vs “Use \[Our App] for invoicing” to avoid conflict.

- **FR6.11 Invoice Template and Numbering Config:** Allow some customization:

  - Company logo upload for invoice.
  - Default notes/terms text (set in settings).
  - Starting invoice number or prefix (some like “INV-1001” vs just number).

- **FR6.12 Permissions and Visibility:** Only certain roles can create invoices (likely Admin and Editors). Viewers might still see the invoice list or at least see that income in reports but maybe not full invoice details if sensitive (though invoices are usually not secret).
- **FR6.13 Reports related to Invoices:**

  - Provide metrics like total invoices sent in a period, total collected, collection rate, average time to get paid, etc. These might be on a separate AR dashboard or incorporated in cash metrics.
  - Also, allow a cash projection specifically from invoices (like if you want to see expected cash from all open invoices over next months).

- **FR6.14 Invoice Line Items to Categories:** Possibly allow mapping invoice line items to categories for cash flow categorization. E.g., an invoice might have different revenue lines (product vs service), and when that payment comes, user may want to classify how much was from each category. That’s maybe too granular; likely just treat full invoice amount as one inflow category (e.g., “Sales”).
- **FR6.15 Multi-currency Invoices:** If applicable, an invoice might be issued in a different currency. If so, we need to record exchange rate and reflect the home currency equivalent for cash flow. This is advanced usage—likely assume same currency to start or handle simply (like a foreign currency invoice’s cash flow effect is converted on payment date via a rate).

The invoice management features directly address “modules for ... invoice management as related components” from the prompt. By including this, our tool not only forecasts cash but can help accelerate cash inflow (through timely invoicing and follow-up), which is a critical part of cash flow management. Effective invoice management improves cash flow by reducing delays and errors in billing, thus our product offering this integrated capability can be a major benefit.

### 6.7 User Management and Access Control

_(Some of these were touched under Roles but here we formalize requirements.)_

- **FR7.1 User Invitation:** The system shall allow an Admin user to invite new users to the company account. This can be done by entering the user’s email and selecting a role for them. The invited user receives an email with a sign-up link to set their password and join the account.
- **FR7.2 Role Assignment:** The system shall enforce that each user has one of the predefined roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer, etc. as defined in Section 4.2). Based on role:

  - Control what pages/features are accessible. E.g., a Viewer cannot see the “New Transaction” or “Edit Budget” options.
  - Control actions: If a Viewer somehow tries an edit operation (by URL hacking or error), the backend shall reject it with permission error.

- **FR7.3 Change Role/Remove User:** Admins can change a user’s role or remove (deactivate) a user from the account. Removing a user should prevent login and remove their access, but preserve any historical records of things they did (for audit).
- **FR7.4 My Profile:** Every user can manage their own profile: name, email (possibly), password changes, and 2FA settings if available.
- **FR7.5 Authentication:** The system shall support secure login. Passwords must be stored hashed. Ideally support multi-factor authentication (at least via authenticator app or SMS) as an option for added security given sensitive data.
- **FR7.6 Single Sign-On (SSO) (Optional enterprise feature):** For larger clients, SSO via SAML or OAuth (Google, Office 365) could be supported. Perhaps a future addition, but we keep the architecture ready for it (modular auth).
- **FR7.7 Audit Log (User Activities):** The system shall maintain an audit log of key actions, including user management actions. For example, record “User A invited User B with Editor role on DATE”. Also log logins (time, IP) for security. Admins (and perhaps auditors) can view this log.
- **FR7.8 Data Partitioning:** Ensure that users can only access data of their own company. (This is a multi-tenant SaaS concern – one company’s users should not see another’s data. The system should enforce company/org segregation on every data request.)
- **FR7.9 Session Management:** Users should be able to log out, and the system should timeout sessions after inactivity (for security, e.g., auto-logout after 30 minutes idle or configurable).
- **FR7.10 Role-based UI Customization:** The system should tailor the interface based on role:

  - For example, a Viewer might have a simplified read-only dashboard with no edit buttons.
  - An Admin might see an “Admin Panel” or settings that others don’t (like user management, integration settings).
  - This improves usability by not showing irrelevant options to certain roles.

- **FR7.11 Multiple Company Accounts:** Out of scope for now is if a single user (like an accountant) wants to manage multiple companies through one login. That scenario we might consider in the future (like being invited to multiple companies and switching context). For v1, we may assume one company per login (with separate emails if needed). But we can design user model with potential for linking to multiple companies (for external accountant persona).
- **FR7.12 Privacy Controls:** If needed, allow certain data hiding based on role. For instance, maybe a Viewer shouldn’t see salary transactions details (if sensitive). That level of granularity is complex. We likely won’t implement that initially except by not giving some people access at all. For more granularity, might consider a future feature.

### 6.8 Notifications and Alerts

_(Though not explicitly asked, it's implied in user stories and adds value, so formalizing requirements.)_

- **FR8.1 Configurable Email Alerts:** The system shall allow users (each user or at least Admin) to opt-in to email notifications for various triggers:

  - Low cash balance alert (if projected balance in next X days < threshold).
  - Budget variance alert (as defined earlier).
  - Invoice overdue alert (if an invoice passes due date).
  - Integration failure alert (if sync fails).
  - Perhaps daily/weekly summary of cash position and upcoming events.

- **FR8.2 In-App Notifications:** The application shall have an in-app notification center or banner for important alerts. E.g., a banner “Warning: Projected cash balance goes negative on Aug 15, 2025” on the dashboard, or a notification icon listing recent alerts (similar to how social apps show notifications).
- **FR8.3 Notification Delivery:** Ensure time-based alerts run on schedule (which means some background job scheduler needed). E.g., a check every night for conditions or a trigger-based approach (like after forecast calc).
- **FR8.4 Snooze/Dismiss:** Users should be able to dismiss an alert or snooze certain notifications so they’re not nagged repeatedly about the same known issue.
- **FR8.5 Audit/Log of Notifications:** Possibly log when notifications were sent (so user can later verify an email was indeed sent, in case they claim they didn’t get warning of something).
- **FR8.6 Mobile Notification (future):** If a mobile app exists, push notifications might mirror these alerts. Not in web app initially beyond email.

With all functional requirements enumerated, the development team can implement and the QA team can verify each. We will next cover non-functional requirements and architecture to ensure the solution as a whole meets performance, security, and other quality standards.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) define the qualities and constraints of the system – how it performs, how secure it is, how it can scale, etc. These are just as critical as functional requirements, especially given we are dealing with financial data in a SaaS product. Below we outline key NFR categories:

### 7.1 Performance and Scalability

- **NFR1.1 Response Time:** The application’s key interactions (loading the dashboard, generating a standard cash flow report, adding a transaction) shall have a fast response. Specifically, for typical data volumes (see NFR1.4), pages should load within 2-3 seconds. Heavy operations like generating a 5-year forecast scenario might take longer, but even those should ideally complete within 10 seconds. The UI should provide feedback (loading spinners) for anything taking more than 1 second to avoid user frustration.
- **NFR1.2 Throughput and Concurrency:** The system shall support multiple concurrent users from the same company and from different companies performing actions without noticeable degradation. As a SaaS platform, it should scale to hundreds of concurrent user sessions initially. The architecture should be designed to scale further (via load balancing, additional instances) to thousands as the user base grows.
- **NFR1.3 Data Volume Handling:** The system must handle reasonably large data sets, especially for larger SMBs or mid-market clients:

  - Support companies with up to e.g., 50,000 transactions per year (which is \~4,000 per month) without performance issues in reporting or forecasting. Many small businesses will have far fewer, but we should accommodate heavier use (some might import many years of history).
  - Ensure that report generation or filtering operations use efficient queries (with indices) to handle these volumes. If necessary, paginate or lazy-load in UI for extremely large lists (like invoice list).

- **NFR1.4 Scalability Strategy:** The system shall be designed for horizontal scalability:

  - Stateless application servers so they can be duplicated behind a load balancer to handle more users.
  - Efficient database design; consider read replicas for heavy read/report loads if needed.
  - Use of caching for repeated calculations (e.g., caching a forecast result so not re-calculated on every request unless data changed).
  - Potential use of queued jobs for intensive tasks (like generating a complex scenario) so as not to block UI thread.

- **NFR1.5 Capacity Limits and Testing:** We should define some capacity limits:

  - E.g., tested to at least 200 concurrent users and data of 100k transactions per company. We should test near these limits to ensure acceptable performance and no crashes.
  - If any limits will be enforced (like max transactions or max users for a plan), the system should handle gracefully and document them.

- **NFR1.6 Availability of Data:** The app should feel responsive. For example, the dashboard might initially load summary numbers, and then charts (which might be slower to generate) can load asynchronously after. This way the user sees something quickly and doesn’t wait staring at blank screen. Use of progressive loading techniques is encouraged in design.
- **NFR1.7 Forecast Performance:** The forecasting engine must handle iterative calculations possibly for each day forward. If advanced algorithms are used (like Monte Carlo simulation for risk analysis, in future), that could be heavy. But for v1, linear scenarios should be fine. Just ensure any heavy loop is optimized (or moved to server side and maybe precomputed).
- **NFR1.8 Geographic Performance:** Users might be global. The system should be hosted such that response time is decent globally (maybe cloud with CDN for static content). Real-time data mostly from central DB, so consider multi-region in future if needed for latency.

### 7.2 Security

- **NFR2.1 Authentication & Authorization:** The system shall enforce secure authentication (unique user accounts, strong password policy or SSO). All API endpoints must check for valid session/auth token, and verify the user’s authorization (role) for each request. No data should be accessible without auth.
- **NFR2.2 Data Encryption In-Transit:** All communications between client and server shall be encrypted via HTTPS (SSL/TLS). This protects sensitive financial data from eavesdropping.
- **NFR2.3 Data Encryption At-Rest:** Sensitive data stored in the database shall be encrypted at rest. This includes personal identifiable information (user credentials) and potentially financial transaction details, especially if on cloud storage. At least, full-disk encryption on the DB server or using encrypted columns for things like integration tokens.
- **NFR2.4 Secure Data Access (Multitenancy):** Ensure strict tenant isolation. One company’s data should never be accessible by another company’s users. Queries should always filter by company ID. There should be tests in place to validate that cross-tenant access is impossible.
- **NFR2.5 Compliance Standards:** Given we deal with financial data, the platform should aim to comply with relevant industry standards over time:

  - **SOC 2 Type II** for security, availability, confidentiality – implementing proper controls and audits.
  - **GDPR** (if we have EU users) for data privacy: allow data export/delete for a user if requested, etc.
  - **PCI DSS** if we process credit card payments for invoices (which we might if integrating payment gateway) – at least, any payment info must not touch our servers unencrypted to remain compliant. Likely we’ll use a hosted fields approach to avoid storing card data.
  - While immediate certification might not be done by v1 release, designing with these in mind is important. For example, logging of access, strong encryption, incident response plan, etc., as required by SOC2.

- **NFR2.6 Role-Based Access Control:** We have roles – the system shall enforce least privilege. For instance, only Admins can manage users or integration keys. Only authorized roles can approve high impact actions (like deleting lots of data or exporting all data). This prevents misuse or accidents by lower privileged users.
- **NFR2.7 Audit Logging:** As mentioned, keep an audit log of important activities (user logins, data changes like who edited a transaction, who adjusted a budget, who sent an invoice). This log should be tamper-evident (i.e., not easily editable; possibly write-once or append-only style storage or at least restricted access). This is important for forensic analysis in case of issues and is often a SOC2 requirement.
- **NFR2.8 Data Backup and Recovery:** The system must regularly back up critical data (databases) and have a tested recovery procedure. Losing financial records would be catastrophic for users. Aim for backups daily (with point-in-time if possible) and retention for some period (e.g., last 30 days daily backups).
- **NFR2.9 Session Security:** Implement measures like session timeout (as noted in FR7.9), protection against session hijacking (regenerate tokens periodically, use secure cookies with HttpOnly, SameSite flags to prevent XSS/CSRF issues).
- **NFR2.10 Network Security:** Host the application in a secure environment:

  - Firewalls to restrict DB access only to app servers.
  - Use of security groups, minimal open ports.
  - Regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing, especially before major releases.

- **NFR2.11 Secure Development Practices:** The team shall follow secure coding guidelines (validate inputs to prevent SQL injection, use parameterized queries or ORM, output encoding to prevent XSS in web, etc.). Any integration keys or secrets in code should be in secure config, not hardcoded.
- **NFR2.12 Third-Party Security:** When connecting to external APIs (QuickBooks, etc.), ensure we handle their keys securely. Also, ensure compliance with their terms (like storing refresh token securely).
- **NFR2.13 Privacy of Personal Data:** If we store any personal data (names/emails of users, customer info for invoices), comply with privacy laws:

  - Provide a way to delete or anonymize data if a customer leaves the platform (right to be forgotten).
  - Only collect what is necessary. E.g., for invoice customers, only what’s needed to invoice them.

- **NFR2.14 Security Monitoring:** Employ monitoring for suspicious activities:

  - Unusually high number of failed logins (possible brute force attempt) triggers an alert or temporary IP block.
  - Unusual data access patterns (someone exporting massive data or repeatedly hitting endpoints) flagged.
  - Maintains logs to detect breaches, etc.

- **NFR2.15 User Security Features:** Provide features like two-factor auth (mentioned), and maybe IP whitelisting for logins (some companies might want that). Also, password reset flows should be secure (via email token, etc.).
- **NFR2.16 Data Integrity:** Ensure that the calculations (like forecast, reports) are correct and consistent. We consider it a security aspect in terms of data integrity that, for example, if an error or inconsistency is detected in calculations, the system should flag it or reconcile it (to avoid user making decisions on wrong info).

Security is paramount as trust is key for users of financial software. A breach or data leak could ruin the product’s reputation. Following best practices and possibly obtaining certifications is a goal. _“SaaS providers must adopt specific information security management controls under SOC2 to protect data against unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration”._ We take that seriously in our design.

### 7.3 Availability & Reliability

- **NFR3.1 Uptime Goal:** The platform should be highly available. Target uptime (excluding scheduled maintenance) should be at least **99.9%** (which is about <= 8.8 hours downtime per year). In SLA terms, that’s good for a B2B SaaS. We can aim for even 99.99% in future, but 99.9% is a practical starting SLA.
- **NFR3.2 Redundancy:** There shall be no single point of failure in production deployment:

  - Use multiple app server instances; if one goes down, others handle traffic.
  - Redundant database setup (master and replica(s), or a cluster) so that a db instance failure doesn’t result in total outage or data loss.
  - Redundant storage for any file uploads (use of cloud storage with replication across zones).
  - If deployed in cloud, deploy across availability zones so that a data center outage doesn’t bring the site down.

- **NFR3.3 Disaster Recovery:** Define RPO and RTO:

  - **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** e.g., maximum data loss of 1 hour in worst case (meaning backups or replication should ensure we can restore to within an hour of the latest data).
  - **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** e.g., in case of a major outage, service should be restored within 4 hours (or whatever is acceptable to business).
    Plans should be in place to meet these (backups, failovers).

- **NFR3.4 Graceful Degradation:** In case some components fail (e.g., the integration service is down because QuickBooks API is failing), the application should gracefully degrade:

  - Core features (like viewing existing data) should still work even if new data can’t be fetched at the moment.
  - If forecast service is separate and fails, the app might show last good forecast and a message “forecast currently unavailable, please retry later” rather than breaking the whole app.

- **NFR3.5 Maintenance Downtime:** Any planned maintenance (like DB upgrades) should be scheduled in off-peak hours and communicated to users in advance. Aim to use rolling deployments and zero-downtime updates as much as possible to avoid any outage.
- **NFR3.6 Consistency:** We should ensure data consistency. If multiple servers or processes are updating data, use transactions or locking to avoid race conditions. For instance, if two users try to edit the same budget at once, one should prevail and maybe we lock or merge changes. (Maybe optimistic locking with a version number to alert if someone else changed meanwhile.)
- **NFR3.7 Monitoring & Alerts:** The system should be monitored with tools that check uptime and performance. Alerts should be configured to notify the devops team of issues (high error rates, high response times, server down) so they can respond before customers notice sometimes.
- **NFR3.8 Failover Testing:** We should periodically test that failover mechanisms work (e.g., simulate a primary DB failure and ensure the replica takes over properly).
- **NFR3.9 Capacity Management:** We should monitor usage and have scaling rules such that if usage increases (CPU, memory, DB connections nearing limits), the system can auto-scale or we at least get alerted to add capacity. Being SaaS, if we sign a big customer, we need to handle surge.
- **NFR3.10 Client-side Resilience:** If the user’s network flickers or a request fails, the front-end could handle it gracefully (show error and allow retry). For example, if saving a transaction fails due to network, allow them to retry without losing what......
