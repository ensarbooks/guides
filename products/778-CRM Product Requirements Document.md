## Feature 1: Email Sync & Tracking

### Scope and Overview

**Scope:** Enable seamless two-way email integration between the CRM and email providers (e.g. Gmail, Outlook) and provide email tracking capabilities. This feature automatically logs emails to the CRM and tracks recipient engagement (opens, clicks, attachments viewed) for sales and account management activities. It ensures every relevant email interaction with leads and contacts is captured in one place, giving users insight into communication effectiveness. Tracking functionality includes notifying users when emails are opened or links clicked, helping time follow-ups effectively. This feature covers individual one-to-one emails; mass email campaigns are covered separately in Feature 2.

**Overview:** Email Sync allows users to connect their email inbox to the CRM so that sent and received messages related to CRM contacts are recorded without manual effort. Email Tracking provides analytics on those emails – e.g. whether a recipient opened the email or clicked a link – and surfaces this data in the CRM’s contact/activity timelines. Together, these capabilities ensure a “single source of truth” for email communications: users work either from their email client or the CRM, and all interactions stay in sync. The result is improved sales productivity and better timing of customer follow-ups by leveraging insights into email engagement.

### Target Users and Personas

- **Sales Representatives (Account Executives):** Primary users who send one-to-one emails to leads and customers. They benefit by having emails automatically logged and knowing when prospects engage (e.g. opens/clicks) so they can follow up at the right moment. _Persona Goal:_ “As a sales rep, I want my emails to log in CRM and to know if the prospect read them, so I can prioritize hot leads.”
- **Sales Managers:** Monitor team email activity and campaign effectiveness. They use tracking metrics (open/click rates) to coach reps and refine messaging. _Persona Goal:_ “As a sales manager, I want insight into email engagement across my team, so I can identify effective outreach strategies.”
- **Account Managers/Customer Success:** Use email sync to have a history of client communications in the CRM for context. Tracking alerts them if a client is not engaging, indicating possible satisfaction issues.
- **CRM Administrators:** Set up and manage the email integration settings (e.g. connecting company email domains, ensuring security). They ensure compliance (email permissions, data handling) and assist users with onboarding their inboxes.

### Functional Requirements and User Stories

**Functional Requirements:**

- **Two-Way Email Integration:** The CRM shall connect with popular email services via secure protocols (OAuth for Gmail/Office 365, IMAP/SMTP, or APIs) to synchronize messages. Incoming emails from contacts are automatically captured, and outgoing emails sent from the CRM or email client are recorded in both systems.
- **Automatic Email Logging:** When an email is sent or received, if the sender/recipient matches a contact or lead in the CRM, the email is automatically attached to that record’s history (with metadata like date, thread, attachments). Users can also manually log or forward emails to a unique CRM address if needed (for edge cases like BCC forwarding).
- **Email Tracking Pixels/Mechanism:** The system shall insert a tracking pixel or unique link for outbound emails sent through the CRM to detect opens and link clicks. The CRM captures at least: open events (timestamp, device if possible) and click events (which link was clicked, timestamp).
- **Engagement Notifications:** Users (senders) shall receive real-time notifications or alerts when a recipient opens their email or clicks a link. This could be via in-app notification center and/or email/mobile push (“Prospect John Doe opened your email just now”). Notification settings should be configurable to avoid spamming the user.
- **Contact Record Integration:** Email engagement data is visible on the contact’s timeline (e.g. an entry “Email ‘Product Quote’ sent on Oct 1 – _Opened 2 times, Last opened Oct 2 10:34am_”). The system may visually distinguish between sent vs. received emails and show the tracking status (opened, not opened, clicked links, etc.).
- **Compose Email in CRM:** Provide a built-in email composer within the CRM’s UI (for users who prefer sending from CRM). This composer should allow selecting templates (see Feature 17), attaching files, and has an option to enable/disable tracking for that email. Sending via the CRM uses the user’s connected email account (sending “from” their address).
- **Threading & History:** Sync ensures that email threads are preserved. If multiple replies occur, the CRM either threads them under one conversation view or lists them sequentially. The CRM should avoid duplicating the same email if it’s already logged.
- **Email Search:** Users can search within the CRM for emails by subject, content, or contact name, retrieving those synced messages. This aids quick reference to past communications.
- **Authentication & Security:** OAuth authentication flows for major providers so users do not have to input passwords into the CRM. The system shall adhere to provider scopes (e.g., read/write mailbox). All data in transit must be encrypted (HTTPS/SSL). No email content is exposed to unauthorized users; CRM respects user permissions (e.g., a private email not linked to a CRM contact should not be visible to others).
- **Admin Controls:** Admins can enable/disable email sync per user or globally, manage provider integrations, and set policies (e.g., allowable domains, data retention from emails). For example, an admin might restrict syncing personal emails that aren’t related to business contacts.

**User Stories:**

- _As a Sales Rep, I want to connect my Outlook inbox to the CRM so that all emails to or from my clients **automatically log** on their CRM records, saving me manual copy-paste effort._
- _As a Sales Rep, I want to **track when a prospect opens or clicks** on my email, so that I can time my follow-up call when their interest is peaked._
- _As a Sales Rep, I want to be **notified** immediately when an important email (e.g. a proposal) is opened by the recipient, so I can quickly follow up with a relevant message or call._
- _As a Sales Manager, I want the CRM to **log all team email activities** to customer records, so I have full visibility into communications and can ensure follow-ups aren’t missed._
- _As a Sales Manager, I want to see **aggregate email engagement metrics** (open rates, etc.) by template or by rep, so that I can identify what email approaches are working best._
- _As an Account Manager, I want to view a client’s **entire email correspondence history** in one timeline, so I have context before my meeting and don’t ask the client to repeat information._
- _As a CRM Admin, I want to ensure the email integration is **secure and compliant**, so that sensitive customer data in emails is protected and our company meets privacy requirements._

### Workflow Diagram / Logic Flow

**Email Sync Flow:** 1) _User authentication:_ The user connects their email account via settings (select provider, OAuth login). 2) _Background sync:_ The system starts syncing emails at regular intervals (e.g. via webhook or polling). New inbound/outbound emails are fetched. 3) _Matching:_ For each email, the system checks if the sender or any recipients match CRM contacts/leads by email address. If a match is found, the email is attached to those CRM records. If multiple contacts share an email address, flag for user to manually resolve linking (to avoid incorrect associations). 4) _Logging:_ The email content (subject, body snippet, timestamp, sender, recipients) and any attachments or links are saved under the record’s activity timeline. 5) _Tracking:_ When a user sends an email **from CRM**, a unique tracking pixel and link wrappers are added. If sent from outside (e.g. Gmail directly), the email can be logged but tracking might only work if an add-on is installed in the email client – our scope assumes sending via CRM for tracking. 6) _Engagement:_ When the recipient opens the email or clicks a link, the tracking service notifies the CRM (e.g. via a callback URL). The CRM then updates the email record (mark as opened, increment counter) and triggers a notification to the sender. 7) _User follow-up:_ The sales rep sees the notification and can then log a call or task follow-up. The cycle continues for replies (which will sync in as well).

In diagrammatic form, the flow is: **User connects inbox → System syncs emails (with matching to contacts) → Email records created in CRM**. For outgoing: **User sends email (CRM inserts tracking) → Recipient opens → CRM logs engagement & notifies user**. All synced emails appear in the contact’s 360° view, ensuring the user always has context on communications.

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Integration Setup UI:** Provide a straightforward settings page for users to connect/disconnect their email. It should list supported providers with icons (Gmail, Outlook, others) for easy recognition. After connecting, indicate status (e.g., “Connected to Gmail as [jane.doe@company.com](mailto:jane.doe@company.com)”). Also show last sync time and a “Sync Now” button for manual refresh if needed.
- **Email Timeline Display:** On the contact/account page, emails should be displayed in reverse chronological order alongside other activities. Use an email icon to denote the item type. Show key info at a glance: subject line (which is clickable to expand the full email), sender/recipient, date/time, and **tracking status** (e.g., a small indicator if opened or not). For example: an unopened email might show a grey unopened icon, whereas an opened email shows an open-eye icon with number of opens.
- **Email Detail View:** When viewing an email in CRM, show the full content in a formatted way (preserve basic HTML styling or at least line breaks). Include attachments as downloadable links. The UI could present the email thread if multiple exchanges – similar to an email client. Ensure it’s easy to distinguish what the user sent vs. what the contact replied (e.g., use labels “You -> John Doe” vs “John Doe -> You”).
- **Compose Window:** If composing from CRM, it can be a modal popup or separate pane. It should auto-suggest contacts as recipient when typing (from CRM database). Provide CC/BCC fields if needed. A toggle for “Track this email” should be on by default (configurable). If tracking is enabled, possibly show a small notice like “👁 Email Opens & Link Clicks will be tracked”. UX must clarify this is only visible to the sender, not the recipient (to avoid privacy confusion).
- **Notifications UX:** When an email event occurs (open/click), provide a subtle but visible notification. For example, a pop-up toast: “🔔 Your email to **John Doe** (“Proposal for Q4”) was opened just now.” Also list these notifications in a “Recent Alerts” section for later review. Allow clicking the notification to jump to that contact or email detail. On mobile (see Feature 14), ensure these notifications also appear via push.
- **Error Feedback:** If the email sync disconnects (password change, token expired), show an alert in UI (banner saying “Reconnect your email to resume syncing”). If an email fails to send from the CRM (e.g. SMTP issue), display an error with guidance (and do not log it as sent).
- **Mobile Consideration:** The email sync/tracking feature should extend to mobile usage. If the CRM has a mobile app, users should be able to view email history on a contact and see tracking indicators. Composing might deep-link to the device’s mail app or provide an in-app compose if feasible. Notifications of opens should ideally push to the mobile device in real-time as well, if user has notifications enabled.

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

- **Authentication Failures:** If a user’s email password/token changes or is revoked, the system should detect failed sync attempts. In this case, it pauses syncing for that user and prompts them to re-authenticate (with a clear UI message). No silent failures – users must be informed if emails aren’t syncing.
- **Duplicate Email Logs:** If an email is sent to multiple CRM contacts, it might be logged on each of their records. To avoid confusion, the system might log once and reference all associated contacts. Edge case: the same email might be part of a long thread with multiple contacts CC’d – ensure it doesn’t multiply-log infinitely. Merging logic to detect “already logged this message ID” is needed.
- **Privacy and Opt-Out:** If a contact opts out of tracking (e.g., they have email clients blocking images or they request not to be tracked), the tracking pixel might not fire. The system should handle that some opens won’t be detected. Additionally, provide a way to mark a contact as “Do Not Track” if needed for compliance, so that emails to them don’t include tracking.
- **External Replies:** If a contact replies to an email, the reply email should sync into the CRM as well (since the contact’s address is recognized). Ensure that the threading links the reply to the original email if possible. If not, at least log it as a separate incoming email activity.
- **Multiple Accounts/Aliases:** If a user has multiple email aliases, ensure emails sent from any of those linked addresses are captured. Possibly allow connecting more than one email account per user if they use several (or at least clarify one primary).
- **Email Attachments Size/Format:** If an email has a very large attachment, the CRM might choose not to store the file itself (to save space) but still record that an attachment was sent. Edge case handling for attachment storage limits should be defined (e.g., max 25MB file sync). For tracking, downloads of attachments might not be tracked unless using special link wrappers.
- **Email Client Formatting:** Emails can contain HTML or special formatting (images, signatures). The CRM should display these reasonably (maybe strip scripts for security). Edge case: encrypted emails or secure email threads might not be importable – these could be skipped with a note.
- **Unmatched Emails:** If an email is synced that doesn’t match any contact (e.g., the user emailed someone not yet in CRM), the system could either ignore it or hold it in a “Unmatched Emails” queue. Perhaps an edge case feature: allow user to create a new contact from an unmatched email entry (“We found an email with [bob@newco.com](mailto:bob@newco.com), create contact for Bob?”). If not in scope, such emails are simply not logged.
- **Tracking Blocked or Multiple Opens:** Some corporate recipients block tracking pixels. The system might never get an “open” event – it should then treat it as “not opened or undetected.” Also, if a recipient opens an email multiple times or forwards it, multiple open events may fire. The system should aggregate sensibly (e.g., show “Opened 3 times” rather than spamming the user with 3 identical notifications, perhaps consolidate events within a short timeframe).
- **Time Zone on Logged Times:** Ensure that timestamps of sends/opens in the UI respect the user’s time zone or clearly label if in UTC.

### Business Rules and Data Integrity Needs

- **Email Association Rules:** Only associate an email with CRM records when there is an exact email address match with a contact/lead/user. To maintain data integrity, the system must not accidentally expose emails to the wrong record. (E.g., if two contacts share a generic email like [info@client.com](mailto:info@client.com), consider treating that carefully or linking to an Account instead of individual contact to avoid confusion.)
- **Read/Unread Status in CRM:** The CRM’s representation of whether an email was “read” by the recipient is based on tracking data. If no open is detected, assume unread. However, to avoid false assumptions, perhaps mark it as “Not tracked” or “No open detected” rather than a definitive “unread” since the pixel could have been blocked. Business rule: an unopened email that’s a week old might be considered a stale lead for follow-up.
- **Logging Only Business Emails:** The system should allow filtering out personal emails. For example, if internal emails or non-customer communications are syncing, users might mark those as not to log. A rule could be: only log emails where at least one address belongs to an external domain (not the user’s own company) to reduce noise. Alternatively, give users a manual control (like a checkbox “Log this email to CRM” in their email client via a plugin, though that is a nice-to-have beyond auto-logging).
- **Data Retention and Deletion:** Business rule: If a user or admin deletes an email from the CRM, decide whether it should also delete from the email server (probably not – safer to only remove the CRM copy). Typically, CRM should not be a full email client replacement; it’s a mirror. So if a contact or email is deleted in CRM for GDPR compliance, we might leave the actual email in the user’s mailbox but purge it from CRM records. Define how long the CRM keeps email data – likely indefinitely unless user purges.
- **One-click Unsubscribe & Compliance:** Although this feature is about one-to-one email, if any semi-mass use occurs, ensure compliance with email laws (CAN-SPAM/GDPR). Possibly not directly applicable here, but for tracking: ensure that the tracking mechanism is not violating privacy policies the company adheres to. Some companies might include “This email uses a tracking system for internal analytics” in fine print – that’s a business policy beyond product, but the feature should have the capability to exclude tracking if needed.
- **Availability of Tracking Info:** Ensure the email open/click data is only visible to appropriate users. For instance, a private email to a contact that is marked confidential might be logged but with restricted visibility (maybe using CRM permissions – see Feature 20). By default, if a user can see a contact’s activities, they see email events. The system shouldn’t allow a user to track emails for contacts they don’t own unless permissions allow.
- **Integration Continuity:** If multiple users email the same contact, all those emails should log under the one contact record (not separate entries per user). So the data model ties emails to contact (and possibly to the sender user as well). This ensures a 360° view for the contact and integrity in not duplicating contact entries.
- **Notification Throttling:** A business rule to prevent notification overload – e.g. if a single email is opened 10 times in an hour, perhaps notify the first open and then just update a counter quietly. This ensures the user isn’t distracted excessively while still capturing the data.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1: Email Integration Setup** – Given a user with a valid email account, when they follow the CRM’s connection process, then the system establishes a link and confirms “Email account connected” in the UI. If credentials are wrong or access is denied, an error message explains the issue.
- **AC2: Automatic Logging of Sent Email** – When the user sends an email to a CRM contact (either from within the CRM’s email composer or from their regular email client), then within a short time (e.g., <1 minute) that email appears in the contact’s activity timeline in CRM, with correct subject, sender/recipient info, and timestamp. The email content and attachments are accessible in CRM.
- **AC3: Automatic Logging of Received Email** – When an email is received from a known contact to the user’s inbox, then it is logged on that contact’s timeline similarly. The system should attribute it as “Received” and show the sender as the contact.
- **AC4: Email Tracking Pixel Insertion** – If a user sends an email through the CRM (or using the CRM’s send function), then the outgoing email contains the tracking mechanisms (verified by, for instance, a unique image reference or redirect link in the email source). This should happen automatically without breaking the email’s appearance.
- **AC5: Open and Click Detection** – For an email where tracking is enabled, if the recipient opens the email or clicks a link, then the CRM updates the status of that email (e.g., marking it opened with a timestamp in the CRM record). A notification is generated for the sender. **Test:** Send a test email to a monitored address, open it, and verify the CRM reflects an open event within, say, 1 minute, and that the sender sees a notification.
- **AC6: Notification Control** – The user can configure or mute email open notifications if desired. This is accepted if, for example, an option “Turn off open notifications” exists in user settings and works.
- **AC7: Viewing Email in CRM** – The UI for viewing a logged email must display the email body legibly and list attachments. **Test:** The user clicks an email in the timeline, and a detail view shows the content (or it opens in a new window) properly formatted.
- **AC8: Security & Privacy** – Emails sync only to authorized records. **Test:** If a user does not have permission to view a contact, they should not see that contact’s emails. If an email is sent to two different contacts owned by different users, verify that each user only sees it under their contact (unless they have shared access).
- **AC9: Error Handling** – Simulate an authentication token expiration. The system should detect and prompt re-authentication. Simulate a failed email send from CRM (e.g. by disconnecting network): the user should get a clear error and the email should not falsely appear as sent in CRM.
- **AC10: No Data Duplication** – If the same email is sent to multiple contacts or multiple team members, it should not result in conflicting duplicate records. Acceptance if the implementation either de-duplicates or clearly delineates copies.
- **AC11: Performance** – The email sync and tracking processes should not noticeably slow down the CRM. E.g., syncing should happen in the background. Acceptance if typical email logging occurs within a minute and the CRM UI remains responsive.
- **AC12: Compliance Option** – There should be a way to disable tracking for a particular email if needed (e.g., a checkbox “Don’t track this email”). Acceptance if checking that box results in no tracking pixel being added (validated via the sent email content). Similarly, an admin can disable tracking globally if the business policy requires (e.g., for privacy reasons) – acceptance if that toggle removes all tracking functionality.

## Feature 2: Mass Emailing with Analytics

### Scope and Overview

**Scope:** Provide the ability to send a single email to a large list of contacts (bulk email blasts or campaigns) from within the CRM, and track aggregate analytics of those emails. This feature is essentially a mini email marketing tool integrated into the CRM: users can create email campaigns targeting specific segments of leads/contacts, personalize templates, schedule dispatch times, and then monitor metrics such as delivery success, open rates, click-through rates, bounce rates, and unsubscribes. The scope includes list management (selecting recipients, possibly segmenting), email content creation (often using templates or a simple editor), sending in bulk with proper scheduling/throttling, and an **analytics dashboard** per mass email to assess performance. It is distinct from one-to-one emails (Feature 1) in that it’s optimized for one-to-many communication and group metrics rather than individual tracking (though it may still log the emails on individual contacts).

**Overview:** Mass Emailing allows the CRM user (often a marketer or sales rep performing outreach) to efficiently broadcast a message to many recipients at once – for example, a product announcement to all prospects or a follow-up to a batch of leads. The feature will handle merging fields (like injecting each contact’s name), ensuring each recipient gets an individualized email (mass emails are typically sent as separate emails to each person to avoid disclosing the list). The analytics portion collates responses: it shows how many recipients opened the email, clicked any links, or unsubscribed, etc., giving insight into campaign effectiveness. Additionally, the feature should manage compliance aspects (honoring unsubscribes and opt-outs, and not exceeding send limits if set by email providers). This drives marketing and sales to iterate on messaging and target the right audience segments.

### Target Users and Personas

- **Marketing Managers / Email Marketers:** Primary persona for this feature. They run email campaigns to nurture leads or inform customers. They need tools to design bulk emails easily and see campaign metrics to gauge success. _Persona Goal:_ “As a Marketing Manager, I want to send newsletters or promotions to thousands of contacts and track opens/clicks, so I can refine our campaign strategy and prove engagement.”
- **Sales Development Representatives (SDRs):** They might use mass emails for outreach sequences (though often one-to-one feels personal, there are times to send a mass intro email to a list of cold prospects). They need analytics to know who engaged (e.g., to follow up with those who clicked links). _Persona Goal:_ “As an SDR, I want to blast an introduction email to a list of leads and know which ones showed interest (opened or clicked), so I can prioritize my follow-up calls.”
- **Customer Success / Account Management:** They might use bulk email to communicate updates to all their customers (e.g., policy changes, maintenance notices) and want to see who might have missed an important email (didn’t open). _Persona Goal:_ “As a Customer Success Manager, I want to email all clients about a new feature and ensure they saw it by looking at open metrics, so I can personally reach out to those who didn’t.”
- **CRM Administrators:** They ensure that mass emailing is used responsibly (to avoid blacklisting, spam issues) and set up necessary configurations like sender domains or email quotas. They may also manage templates and ensure compliance text (like unsubscribe links) is included in all mass emails.

### Functional Requirements and User Stories

**Functional Requirements:**

- **Bulk Email Composition:** The system shall provide an interface to compose a mass email. This includes a rich text editor for the email body (supporting text formatting, images, hyperlinks) and the ability to insert placeholders/variables (e.g., “Dear {First Name}”) which will be replaced with each recipient’s data. Users can select a **predefined template** (see Feature 17 for template library) or start from scratch.
- **Audience Selection (Mailing List Management):** Users must be able to define the recipient list for the mass email. This could be done by selecting a saved list (segment) or by applying filters on contacts/leads within the CRM (e.g., “All leads with status=Cold from Industry=Retail”). The UI should show the count of recipients selected and perhaps allow previewing a few (to verify the list looks correct). Also include options to exclude certain contacts if needed (for example, those who previously unsubscribed or bounced emails should be automatically excluded by default – compliance rule).
- **Personalization Merge Fields:** The email content can include dynamic fields like {FirstName}, {CompanyName}, etc., which the system will merge for each recipient. Provide a dropdown or auto-complete of available fields from the contact record to insert. For each email sent, the system populates those fields with the individual’s data. If data is missing (e.g., FirstName blank), allow configuring a default value or skipping that personalization for that contact (perhaps default to “there” or simply omit).
- **Send Scheduling:** Users can choose to send the mass email immediately or schedule it for a future date/time. The system will queue the campaign and dispatch at the specified time (taking into account time zone – likely scheduling in user’s local time or explicitly set time zone).
- **Throttling & Batch Sending:** If the list is very large (e.g., thousands of recipients), the system should send emails in batches (to avoid hitting provider limits and to manage load). E.g., “send 200 emails per minute” or similar, depending on technical constraints or third-party SMTP limits. This should be transparent to the user except maybe to show status of sending (“1,000 of 5,000 emails sent...”). If sending fails for some recipients (due to bounces or server issues), the system should retry a few times and then mark those as failed if still not sent.
- **Email Analytics Tracking:** Each email sent in the mass campaign should include tracking for opens and clicks (similar to Feature 1’s tracking pixel and link tracking). Additionally, the system should handle **unique campaign identifiers** so that aggregate stats can be computed. The CRM must track how many of the sent emails were delivered vs. bounced, how many recipients opened, how many clicked at least one link, how many unsubscribed via a link, etc. These should roll up into campaign-level metrics.
- **Unsubscribe Management:** The system shall automatically include an unsubscribe link in every mass email (often mandated by law). If a recipient clicks “Unsubscribe,” the system should record that action and exclude that person from future mass emails (and ideally mark a field “Email Opt-Out = true” on their contact record). There should be a mechanism to manage a “global unsubscribe list” and possibly separate subscription preferences if the product supports multiple mailing categories. At minimum, one-click unsubscribe recording.
- **Bounce Handling:** If an email is undeliverable (hard bounce – e.g., invalid address, or soft bounce – mailbox full, etc.), the system captures that bounce notification (via SMTP response or return email). Hard bounces should be noted on the contact (e.g., mark their email as invalid or bouncing to maintain data integrity) and possibly exclude from future sends. Provide reporting on how many bounced in the campaign.
- **Mass Email Dashboard:** For each sent campaign, provide a dashboard or summary view. Key details: the subject and content of the email, when it was sent (or that it’s scheduled and pending), the audience size, and real-time stats: X sent, Y delivered (sent minus hard bounces), Open Rate (Y% of delivered opened), Click-Through Rate (Z% clicked), number of unsubscribes, and number of replies if any (though replies likely go to the sender’s inbox, not tracked unless we integrate that). The dashboard could also list top clicked links if multiple links were present, and allow drilling down (e.g., show me who clicked, who opened, etc., perhaps by linking to a filtered contact list).
- **Template and Content Reuse:** The user should be able to save the composed email as a template if desired, for future reuse. Additionally, cloning a past campaign should be possible – e.g., “Repeat last month’s newsletter as starting point.”
- **Permission Control for Mass Email:** Not all users might be allowed to send mass emails (to prevent misuse). The system should allow admin to grant or restrict mass emailing rights. E.g., an inexperienced user blasting all clients might be problematic, so perhaps only certain roles can use this feature. If a user without permission tries to access it, the UI should hide or disable it.
- **Email Send Limits & Warnings:** If using integrated email services, there might be limits (e.g., “Your plan allows 5,000 emails/day” or Gmail’s sending limits). The system should be aware of such and warn the user if their list exceeds allowed volume. In some cases, the CRM might integrate with a dedicated email sending service for high volume (if so, that service’s limits apply). At minimum, the user should be informed of any size constraints either by provider or by best practice (e.g., “We recommend splitting lists larger than 10k to avoid spam issues”).
- **A/B Testing (Optional Stretch):** A more advanced functional idea is to allow A/B testing within a mass email (send two variants to see which subject or content performs better). This might be out of initial scope unless targeting a marketing-heavy user base, but worth noting for future. Not a strict requirement unless capacity allows.

**User Stories:**

- _As a Marketing Manager, I want to **send one email to many contacts at once** and have the CRM handle it individually (so each contact sees only their own address), so that I can efficiently communicate a promotion to all leads without manual emailing._
- _As a Marketing Manager, I want to **track the overall open and click rate** of my bulk email campaign, so I can measure engagement and adjust future campaigns accordingly._
- _As a Marketing Manager, I want the system to automatically **handle unsubscribes and bounces**, so that we stay compliant and I don’t accidentally email people who opted out or invalid addresses._
- _As an SDR, I want to **schedule a mass email** to go out tomorrow morning to a list of prospects, so that it reaches them at an optimal time even if I’m not at my computer then._
- _As an SDR, I want to quickly **identify which contacts from my mass email showed interest** (opened or clicked), so I can call those hot leads first and have context for the conversation (knowing they saw the email). The CRM should let me pull up who clicked the email link to request a demo._
- _As a Customer Success Rep, I want the system to **exclude clients who already unsubscribed** from our marketing emails, so that we respect their preferences and avoid annoying them or violating policy._
- _As a CRM Admin, I want to **limit mass email sending to certain users** and ensure all mass emails include the required legal footer (company address, unsubscribe link), so that our company’s mass communications are controlled and compliant._
- _As a Sales Manager, I want to see a **summary report of a mass email** my team sent (like a dashboard of success metrics), so I can report the campaign’s effectiveness to upper management._

### Workflow Diagrams or Logic Flows

**Mass Email Send Workflow:**

1. **Draft Campaign:** User navigates to “Mass Email” or “Campaigns” module in CRM. They click “New Mass Email” and enter campaign details: name (for internal reference), select recipients (either choose a saved segment or apply filters – e.g., all contacts in USA), and compose the email content (with placeholders). The user can preview how it looks for a specific recipient (pick a sample contact to see merged fields).
2. **Schedule/Send:** The user either hits “Send Now” or schedules for later. If scheduling, the campaign is saved with a future timestamp. If sending now, it moves to the sending queue immediately.
3. **Personalized Dispatch Loop:** The system takes each recipient in the list and generates an individual email. It replaces placeholders with that contact’s data. It ensures an unsubscribe link is appended. It sets the email’s headers (like a campaign ID, perhaps a List-Unsubscribe header, etc.). These emails are then sent out one by one or in batches via the email server. If using an integrated email API, it might send via API calls. The system records each attempt and any immediate errors.
4. **Tracking and Responses:** As recipients open or click, those events are fed back into the CRM’s tracking subsystem (e.g., via webhooks or periodic fetches from the email service if applicable). As unsubscribe links are clicked, the system updates the database (mark contact’s “unsubscribed” flag). Bounces come in either real-time or via a bounce mailbox – the system parses those and marks contacts appropriately.
5. **Analytics Aggregation:** The CRM continuously updates the campaign’s stats: number sent, number delivered (sent minus bounces), opens (unique opens count and possibly total opens), clicks (unique clickers and possibly total clicks), and unsubscribes. This is often done by maintaining a list of who did each action, then computing counts and percentages.
6. **User Review:** The user can come to the campaign’s page or dashboard at any time to see current performance. For a scheduled campaign that hasn’t been sent yet, they should see status “Scheduled for X”. During sending, maybe a progress indicator “Sending... (3000/5000 sent)”. After sending, they see final tallies and possibly the option to download lists (e.g., “Download list of recipients who clicked”).
7. **Follow-Up Actions:** The workflow might allow quick actions such as: create a follow-up task for all who clicked (or even automatically via automation rules: e.g., anyone who clicked the offer link and is not yet a customer could be assigned to a rep). Those follow-ups tie into other CRM features like tasks or lead scoring.

**Illustrative Logic Flow:**

- User selects contacts -> System compiles list (removes opt-outs) -> User composes email -> User hits send -> For each contact: send individual email (with tracking + unsubscribe) -> Mark as sent in campaign log.
- Later: If open event -> increment open count (and mark contact as opened); If click -> increment click count (and possibly record which link); If bounce -> mark contact email invalid & increment bounce count; If unsubscribe -> mark contact unsubscribed.
- Campaign status updated in real-time (or near-real-time) as events come in.

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Campaign Creation UI:** This should feel like a guided wizard or a clear form to avoid mistakes. Consider a three-step form: 1) “Recipients” – where user defines the audience, 2) “Content” – where they write or pick the email template, 3) “Review & Send” – a summary showing how many recipients, with maybe a preview of an email and final checks (including an automatic reminder like “Make sure you included an unsubscribe link” if it’s not auto-appended). On the review step, highlight if any recipients will be excluded (e.g., “Note: 5 contacts in your list have unsubscribed and will not receive this email.”).
- **Editor and Preview:** The email editor should be user-friendly – at least supporting basic formatting. Perhaps include a placeholder menu (like “Insert Field” -> list of fields). The preview should update as they type (for a sample contact). There could also be a “Send Test Email” feature: allow the user to send a test to themselves or a small set of addresses to see how it looks in an actual inbox.
- **Analytics Dashboard UI:** After sending, the campaign detail page will be crucial. Design it with key metrics at the top in big numbers: Sent, Delivered, Open Rate, Click Rate, Unsubscribed. Use visualizations if possible: e.g., a bar chart or pie chart of opens vs. not opened, or a line chart of opens over time (maybe over first 48 hours of send). Perhaps a list of top clicked links if relevant (like “Link to Pricing Page – 50 clicks”). Also, provide tabs or sections for _Recipients_: listing all contacts who were sent the email (with columns like Delivered/Opened/Clicked status per contact). Users might filter that list by “show me those who clicked” or “not opened yet” directly from the UI as a call list.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The UI could auto-refresh stats for some time after sending (since most engagement happens within first hours). Alternatively, have a refresh button. If an email is still sending (large list), show a progress indicator and perhaps which batch is currently being processed.
- **Unsubscribe Experience:** The actual email that contacts receive should have a clear unsubscribe option. From the CRM user’s perspective, they might not configure this every time (could be automatically appended based on a template). But ensure the user is aware of it. Possibly show in the preview “Footer and unsubscribe will be added automatically.” The unsubscribe landing page (for the contact) should be hosted by the system and user-friendly (“You have been unsubscribed. Sorry to see you go.” customizable message). But that is external UI (recipient-facing). Internally, provide a view in the CRM for “global unsubscribes” list that the admin can see.
- **Error & Confirmation Messages:** If the user tries to send to a list and something’s off (like no recipients selected, or missing subject line), validate and show an error before sending. After scheduling or sending, show a confirmation dialog (“Your email campaign has been scheduled” or “Emails are being sent now. You can monitor progress in Campaigns Dashboard.”). Possibly require an extra confirmation if sending to an unusually large list (“You are about to send to 50,000 contacts. Are you sure?”) to prevent accidents.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI for creating emails should encourage writing content that looks good on desktop and mobile for recipients. Perhaps suggest using a responsive template. The analytics dashboard should be accessible on desktop primarily; on mobile, maybe a simplified view of stats if needed. However, sending a campaign might be something typically done on desktop due to complexity.
- **Integration with CRM records:** On each contact’s individual timeline, it might optionally log that they were sent a particular campaign email (e.g., “Sent mass email: Spring Promotion on 2025-03-01”). If the contact opened or clicked, that could also reflect on their timeline (“Opened email: Spring Promotion”). This ties the mass email feature back into the 360° contact view. Ensure these entries aren’t too noisy; maybe group them or allow filtering out mass email logs if needed. Possibly denote them with a campaign tag or icon.
- **Saving and Drafts:** If a user is composing a campaign and navigates away, the system should auto-save a draft so they don’t lose their work. Provide a “Save as Draft” button explicitly too. In the campaign list view, show draft campaigns separately, which can be resumed later.

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

- **Large Recipient List Performance:** If the user selects “All contacts” and there are tens of thousands, the system should handle it. Edge case: the selection query might time out or be too large to hold in memory. A solution is to execute sends in streaming or segmented fashion. If something fails mid-way (server restart, etc.), there should be a way to resume or at least the system shouldn’t duplicate emails if resumed.
- **Email Content Errors:** If the user includes an invalid placeholder that doesn’t exist (e.g., {FavouriteColor} and that field isn’t in CRM), the system should prevent sending (validate on compose) or ignore that placeholder during send (leaving it blank or a default). Preferably validation upfront: highlight unknown placeholders.
- **Spam Filtering:** Many mass emails might get caught in spam filters. While not directly controllable by CRM, the system could encourage best practices (like not using certain trigger words, including an unsubscribe link, etc.). If integrated with a service that provides spam score feedback, perhaps warn the user (“This email has characteristics that might be flagged as spam.”). Not core, but a consideration to reduce edge case of all emails going to spam.
- **Provider Send Limits:** If using the user’s connected email (Gmail) to send mass email, note that those providers have strict limits (like Gmail \~500 recipients/day on personal or \~2,000 on G Suite). To avoid hitting those, either enforce sending through a dedicated bulk email service or warn and chunk sends by day. If a send fails due to provider limit (e.g., SMTP returns a “rate limit exceeded”), the system should pause the campaign and retry later or inform the user to reduce volume. Ideally, the CRM is integrated with a scalable email service for this feature.
- **Duplicate Recipients:** If the user’s list inadvertently has duplicate contacts or emails (maybe the same person in two segments), ensure each email address only receives the email once per campaign. The system should de-dup by email address when compiling recipients. If two contacts share one email address, handle according to a rule (probably treat as one recipient to avoid duplicate send, and log the send on both contact records or just one? Better to send once to that email and log on both that they were part of it, to avoid spamming one inbox twice). Clarify in design.
- **Opt-Out Timing:** Edge case: a contact unsubscribed right after the user scheduled a send but before actual send time. The system should still honor the unsubscribe at send time (so re-check opt-outs during sending). If someone unsubscribes mid-campaign (between batched sends), ensure that remaining batches do not include them.
- **Campaign Cancellation:** If a campaign is scheduled or in progress, provide a way to cancel it. Edge: user realizes they made a mistake and wants to stop sending. If they cancel after some emails went out, you cannot “un-send” those, but you can stop remaining ones. The UI should clearly reflect if a campaign was partially sent and then aborted. Acceptance criteria would include verifying cancellation works.
- **Transactional vs Marketing distinction:** Some emails might be operational/transactional (like an important notice) vs marketing. If the CRM allows marking an email as “operational” (so it sends even to those who opted out of marketing, as it’s something like a privacy policy update), that’s an edge consideration. Not required unless compliance needs demand it. If not supported, by default an unsubscribe means no mass email at all to them.
- **Analytics Delays:** Some email events (opens/clicks) might come in over days or weeks. The dashboard should update as they come, but usually, first 24-48h captures bulk. If a user views stats very quickly after send, caution that “Results are coming in” etc. If using external tracking, sometimes delays occur – ensure the system can handle late-arriving events (they still increment counts even after initial display).
- **Multi-language or Encoding:** Ensure that mass email content can handle different languages/character sets if needed (UTF-8 support). Edge: if inserting a contact’s name that has non-Latin characters, or if the email content is in Japanese, the system must preserve the correct encoding. Test against edge character cases to maintain data integrity.
- **Email Client Rendering:** Not exactly error handling in CRM, but be mindful that certain HTML/CSS may not render well in all clients (especially Outlook). Providing some templates tested across clients can mitigate user-created issues. If a user pastes some problematic HTML, maybe a warning or stripping of incompatible code would be nice.

### Business Rules and Data Integrity Needs

- **Consent & Compliance:** A strict business rule: Only send mass emails to contacts who have given appropriate consent (per GDPR/CAN-SPAM/etc.). The CRM should use a field (e.g., a checkbox “Subscribed to Emails”) and automatically exclude anyone who is not opted in. The system must maintain the **unsubscribe list** accurately – once a contact opts out, do not allow sending until they opt back in (if ever). This is key for legal compliance and maintaining sender reputation.
- **Single Opt-Out Database:** The system should treat unsubscribes uniformly. If a contact exists in multiple lists and unsubscribes once, that flag applies globally (unless multiple distinct subscription categories are supported). Data integrity: ensure that if a duplicate contact record has the same email and one got unsubscribed, ideally all records with that email reflect it (to avoid accidental re-import and re-send). Possibly merge logic from Feature 9 ties in here.
- **Accurate Metrics (No Double Counting):** The analytics should count each recipient once for unique opens/clicks. Business rule: Open Rate = (unique opens / delivered) \* 100%. Make sure if a single person opens multiple times, we don’t inflate the numerator for open rate; those extra opens can be counted in a separate “total opens” stat. Similarly for clicks. Data integrity in metrics ensures trust in the numbers reported.
- **Integration with Lead Scoring:** As a business rule, consider that mass email interactions could feed into lead scores (Feature 6). For example, clicking a mass email could add points. Ensure the necessary data (like contact X clicked campaign Y) is accessible to the scoring mechanism. This implies storing individual interaction logs behind the scenes, not just aggregate, which we plan to do.
- **Rate Limiting to Protect Reputation:** A rule might be instituted like “no more than N emails per minute from one domain” to avoid being flagged as spam. This might be configured by admins. While this is more a technical config, documenting it as a rule ensures product doesn’t blast too quickly.
- **Content Rules:** The organization might impose certain rules on content for branding or compliance (like always include company address, or do not include certain sensitive info). Possibly provide default footers or locked sections of templates that cannot be edited by general users (ensuring each email includes necessary info). Data integrity here refers to ensuring every mass email carries required disclosures.
- **Storage of Campaign History:** All campaigns and their results should be stored and accessible later (at least summary). Business rule could be to retain detailed recipient-level data for a certain period (maybe indefinitely, or purge after X years if storage is an issue). But losing that data could hamper long-term analytics. Typically, keep at least aggregate results permanently, and possibly detailed logs as long as contact exists.
- **Bounce Handling and Contact Status:** If an email hard-bounces (invalid address), a rule could be to mark that contact’s email as “Invalid” in the CRM automatically. This prevents future attempts to the same and alerts sales that they need an updated email. Ensure this does not inadvertently mark a temporarily unreachable email as invalid (hence distinguishing hard vs soft bounce).
- **One Campaign at a Time (maybe):** To avoid overload, an admin might set a rule that only one mass campaign can be sent at a time or per user. If a user tries to start a second while one is still sending, either queue it or warn them. This prevents overlapping large sends which could strain systems or confuse analytics.
- **Do Not Mass Email Tag:** Possibly allow marking certain contacts with a “Do not include in mass email” (like VIP clients who should get personal attention rather than mass blasts). The system then always excludes those if present in a list (similar to unsubscribe but maybe an internal designation). This business rule ensures high-touch clients aren’t inadvertently spammed.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1: Audience Selection and Exclusion** – Given a set of contacts including some who opted out, when the user selects all contacts for a mass email, then the system prepares to send to only those who are subscribed. The count of recipients shown should exclude unsubscribed or invalid-email contacts. If 100 contacts exist and 5 are unsubscribed, the review step might say “95 recipients (5 excluded due to unsubscribe).”
- **AC2: Personalization Accuracy** – When a mass email is sent with personalization fields (e.g., first name), then at least a test sample of recipients receive emails with the correct personalized content. _Test:_ Pick a contact “John Smith” and ensure their email says “Dear John”, while “Jane Doe” gets “Dear Jane”. If a contact is missing the field, verify the fallback (like “Dear Customer,” or field just blank but email still sent) is handled as per design.
- **AC3: Delivery and Throttling** – When sending to a large list (simulate a list of e.g. 500 contacts), the system processes all without crashing and respects any sending rate limits. _Test:_ The campaign of 500 finishes sending within a reasonable time (e.g., a few minutes if throttled). If an artificial low limit is set (like 100/min), verify it indeed staggers sends rather than all at once.
- **AC4: Open/Click Tracking Metrics** – After the campaign is sent, when recipients open or click, then the campaign dashboard updates those metrics. _Test:_ For example, open 10 of the emails from various recipients, click links in 4 of them, then check the dashboard shows roughly that number of opens and clicks (unique counts). The open rate percentage should be correct (10/500 = 2% in this test scenario, for instance).
- **AC5: Unsubscribe Functionality** – Include an unsubscribe link in a test email, click it as a recipient, then that contact should be marked unsubscribed in the CRM. Also, future attempt to include that contact in a new campaign should automatically exclude them. _Test:_ Before unsubscribe, contact is “Subscribed = true”. After clicking, the system perhaps shows a confirmation. In CRM, contact’s flag flips to false. Another campaign to same segment doesn’t send to that contact.
- **AC6: Bounce Handling** – Simulate a bounce (e.g., send to an address we know is invalid). The system should mark that address as bounced/invalid and reflect it in the campaign results (e.g., “1 bounce”). _Test:_ The contact’s email field might get an “invalid” notation or bounce count increment. Ensure the campaign’s delivered count = sent - bounce.
- **AC7: Campaign Dashboard Data** – After a campaign, the UI should show all key metrics. _Test:_ Verify that Sent count equals the number of intended recipients minus excludes; Delivered = Sent - bounces; Open count ≤ Delivered; Click count ≤ Open count (since can’t click without opening ideally), Unsub count is accurate to those who clicked unsubscribe. Check that percentages (open rate, CTR) are calculated correctly (within rounding tolerance).
- **AC8: Individual Contact Activity Logging** – For a contact that received a mass email, their record should note it. _Test:_ Open a contact who was in the campaign. There should be an activity like “Mass Email: \[Campaign Name] sent on \[date] – Opened/Not Opened.” If they clicked, maybe an activity “Clicked link in \[Campaign Name]”. At minimum, the send is logged.
- **AC9: Schedule and Cancel** – When a user schedules a campaign for later, it should not send immediately. _Test:_ Schedule an email for 1 hour later, ensure after saving it shows as scheduled. Cancel it before the time; verify no emails were sent and the campaign status becomes “Cancelled” (and no stats beyond 0). If allowed to reach send time, verify it sends at roughly that time.
- **AC10: Permission Enforcement** – If a user without mass-email permission tries to access the feature, they either can’t see it or get an appropriate message. _Test:_ With a test user role (no permission), ensure the “New Mass Email” button is hidden or disabled. Conversely, an allowed user can use it fully.
- **AC11: Template Usage** – If the user saves a template from a campaign or uses a template, ensure the content matches exactly. _Test:_ Save current email as template “Promo Template”. Start a new campaign using that template, verify the content loads identical.
- **AC12: No Duplicate Emails** – If a contact appears twice in the selected segment, they should receive only one email. _Test:_ Create a scenario where the same email is associated with two contact records that meet the filter. After sending, check the sending logs that that email was only sent once. If both records exist, ensure perhaps both got logged as sent (if design chooses to log on both) but physically only one email went out.
- **AC13: User Feedback and Errors** – Try to send a campaign with a known misconfiguration (like no subject line, or no recipients). The system should block it with a clear error (e.g., “Subject is required” or “No recipients selected”). Also, if possible, test a scenario where email sending fails mid-way (simulate by shutting off SMTP after some sends); the system should handle it gracefully (maybe retry or mark partial failure). The acceptance is that it doesn’t just silently stop – it surfaces an error or partial complete status.
- **AC14: Compliance Footer** – Validate that an unsubscribe link and required info appear in actual sent emails. _Test:_ Inspect the raw email received by a test contact – confirm presence of unsubscribe URL and company address if needed. This ensures the system is automatically adding it (if we decided to do so) and that it’s functional.

## Feature 3: Activity Management & Tracking

### Scope and Overview

**Scope:** Provide tools for users to manage and log their activities related to sales and customer relationship tasks, including calls, meetings, tasks/to-dos, and notes. This feature covers creating activities (like scheduling a call or meeting), setting due dates or reminders, marking them complete, and tracking all activities on each lead/contact/deal record. It also includes a way to view and report on activities (e.g., what calls were made, what tasks are overdue, activity counts per rep, etc.). Essentially, it ensures that every interaction or planned follow-up is recorded in the CRM, giving visibility into “what has been done and what is next” for each prospect or customer.

The scope also involves integration with calendars and possibly email (for sending invites or logging Outlook/Google Calendar meetings), though basic functionality can be internal scheduling. Tracking refers to both the system reminding users of upcoming activities and capturing what happened (e.g., call outcomes, meeting notes). This feature enables a structured sales process by keeping a history of actions and prompting timely follow-ups, thereby improving team collaboration and accountability in client interactions.

**Overview:** Activity Management in the CRM allows users to create different types of activities: e.g., **Tasks** (generic to-dos), **Calls** (phone call tasks, often with outcomes like completed, no answer, left voicemail), **Meetings** (which could sync to a calendar), **Emails** (which are covered by Feature 1 but can be considered an activity type), and **Notes** (logging any free-form notes of a conversation). Each activity typically has fields like due date/time, assigned user (who will do it), and related CRM records (which contact or deal it is about). Users can mark activities as completed or reschedule them.

The CRM should provide each user with a view of their open activities (“My Tasks” or “My Calls for Today”) so they can manage daily work. On each contact/account/opportunity, there will be an activity timeline (past and future scheduled) so anyone can see the history and next steps. Managers can track activity volume (e.g., number of calls made by each rep, tasks overdue) to ensure the team is engaging customers adequately. This feature drives consistency and ensures no lead falls through the cracks due to forgotten follow-ups.

### Target Users and Personas

- **Sales Representatives:** Primary users who schedule and complete activities. They use it to organize their day (calls to make, demos to do) and log outcomes so they and the team have a record. _Persona Goal:_ “As a Sales Rep, I want to manage all my calls and follow-up tasks in the CRM, so I never miss contacting a prospect and I can easily see what I’ve done and what’s next.”
- **Sales Managers:** They monitor team activity levels and compliance with process. They want to see if reps are doing the required number of calls, and that all leads have next steps scheduled. _Persona Goal:_ “As a Sales Manager, I want insight into each rep’s activities (calls made, meetings held, tasks open/overdue) to ensure our pipeline is being actively worked and to coach those who are falling behind.”
- **Account Managers/Customer Success:** They use activities to manage ongoing client touchpoints (like quarterly check-in calls, renewal reminders). Ensures they proactively reach out. _Persona Goal:_ “As an Account Manager, I want to set future follow-up reminders for each customer (e.g., check in 1 month before contract renewal) so I maintain good relationships and never miss an important date.”
- **CRM Administrators:** They configure activity types, maybe create default tasks via workflows (Feature 10). They might ensure integration with external calendars works and define which fields are mandatory on activity logging. They also might run reports for management on activity counts.
- **Service/Support Reps:** (if CRM covers this) They may log support calls or tasks here as well, but if it’s mainly sales-focused CRM, this might be secondary.

### Functional Requirements and User Stories

**Functional Requirements:**

- **Activity Types & Creation:** The CRM shall support multiple activity types: e.g. **Task/To-Do**, **Call**, **Meeting**, **Deadline**, **Email**, **Note**. Users can create an activity from multiple contexts (global “add activity” button, from a contact’s page, or from a calendar view). Each activity record should include: a subject/title (e.g., “Call John about proposal”), an activity type, due date and time (except notes might just have a timestamp), an owner (the person responsible, defaulting to creator), related contacts/accounts/deals (to associate the activity with relevant records), and a description/details field for notes.
- **Due Dates, Reminders & Recurrence:** For time-bound activities (tasks, calls, meetings), allow setting a due date/time. Provide the option to set a reminder alarm (e.g., pop-up or email notification 10 minutes before a call or on the due date of a task). Optionally, allow activities to be recurring (e.g., “Call this client every month” – recurrence patterns like daily/weekly/monthly could be advanced but useful for account management). At minimum, support single scheduled activities.
- **Activity List View (“My Work”):** Users should have a consolidated view of their open and upcoming activities. This could be a dashboard or menu “My Activities” showing tasks and events assigned to me, sorted by due date. Possibly separate or filter by type (calls vs tasks vs meetings). Overdue items should be highlighted (perhaps in red or a separate “Overdue” section). This helps users prioritize.
- **Completing/Updating Activities:** Users can mark an activity as completed (or done). Completed activities should remain logged in the record’s history (with a completion timestamp and perhaps outcome). For example, when marking a Call as completed, the user might fill in an “Outcome” field (Reached, Left Voicemail, No Answer, etc.) and notes about the call content. The system should capture who completed it and when. Once completed, it should disappear from “to-do” lists but remain in historical logs. If an activity is not needed anymore, maybe allow deletion or cancelation (though deletion might be restricted to preserve history; maybe marking as “canceled” or “skipped” is better for audit trail).
- **Activity Timeline on Records:** On each Lead/Contact/Account/Deal page, display a chronological list of activities (past and future) related to that record. This gives a quick overview: e.g., “2025-05-01: Call – Completed (notes…)”, “2025-05-10: Meeting scheduled”. It should be easy to add a new activity from this timeline (like a “+” button to add next action). Past activities should show completion status and notes; future ones show due date and allow quick reschedule or edit.
- **Calendar Integration:** Ideally, meetings scheduled in the CRM can sync to the user’s external calendar (Google, Outlook) and vice versa. At minimum, provide an iCal feed or integration such that when a meeting type activity is created with a date/time, it can send an invite to attendees and show up in calendars. If direct sync is out-of-scope, ensure at least an “Export to calendar” (download .ics or send invite email) is available when scheduling a meeting. Calls could also be synced as events or tasks on calendar.
- **Activity Logging and Notes:** The system should prompt for relevant info when logging completion. For calls, perhaps a dedicated form: call outcome (Connected/Not Connected, etc.), call duration (optionally auto-captured if integrated with telephony), and notes. For meetings, maybe capture meeting minutes or summary notes. For tasks, just mark done and add a note if needed. These notes become part of the permanent record on the timeline, contributing to the 360° view of customer interactions.
- **Bulk Activity Actions:** Possibly allow creating activities in bulk (e.g., select 10 contacts and assign “Call them next week” tasks for each). Or allow completing multiple at once (“mark all these 5 tasks as done”). Bulk might not be first priority but could help heavy users.
- **Activity Filters & Search:** In the Activity lists or timeline, allow filtering by type, date range, owner, etc. E.g., a manager might filter to see all calls completed this week by a certain rep. Or a user filters “show me just meetings” in their list. Searching for an activity by keyword (in subject or notes) could also be useful (to find when a certain topic was discussed, for example).
- **Linking to Outcomes (optional integration):** If integrated with phone or email, creation/completion might be automated (e.g., an outgoing call from integrated VOIP could auto-create a call log activity). But that crosses into integration territory. At base, assume manual logging. However, consider future: if Feature 11 (Integration) includes telephony, completed calls might get auto-logged. Ensure the data model can accommodate that (like store a call duration or recording link if provided).
- **KPIs and Reporting:** The system should allow extraction of activity metrics: e.g., number of completed calls per user per day, tasks completed on time vs overdue, etc. While detailed analytics might be part of a Reports feature, the Activity Management system should capture the raw data needed. Possibly include a simple dashboard for users: e.g., “This week you completed 20 activities, you have 5 upcoming, 2 overdue.” For managers, possibly a team activity leaderboard (ties into Feature 16). Actually, Feature 16 covers leaderboards – one likely leaderboard is “Most calls made this month” which relies on activity data. So ensure that integration.
- **Collaboration and Visibility:** Activities might sometimes be assigned to one user but visible to others involved in the account. The CRM should allow certain roles to see each other’s activities on shared records (sales team can see what their colleague did with the same client to avoid duplication). Perhaps allow assigning multiple users to an activity or at least reassigning (e.g., if a rep leaves, manager reassigns their open tasks to someone else).
- **Activity Templates or Sequences (Advanced):** Not strictly required initially, but something to note: pre-defined sequences of activities (like a sales cadence: Day 1 call, Day 3 email, Day 5 call…) could be a powerful feature. That might overlap with automation (Feature 10) and is more advanced, so core requirement is one-off activities; sequences might be future development.

**User Stories:**

- _As a Sales Rep, I want to **schedule a follow-up task** immediately after I finish a call, so I remember to contact that lead again next week if they asked for time to decide._
- _As a Sales Rep, I want to **log the outcome of my calls and meetings** (with notes on what was discussed), so that I and my team have a history of all interactions and I can quickly recall details later._
- _As a Sales Rep, I want the CRM to **remind me of today’s calls and tasks** every morning (via a list or notification), so that I can plan my day and not miss any commitments._
- _As a Sales Rep, I want to **mark tasks as done** when completed and have them drop off my to-do list, so I can focus on remaining work and know my progress._
- _As a Sales Rep, I want to **see all past activities** with a particular client on their profile page (calls made, emails sent, meetings held), so that I have full context before reaching out again._
- _As a Sales Manager, I want to **track my team’s sales activities** (like number of calls per day, meetings scheduled, tasks overdue) in order to gauge effort and identify who might need help or who is doing exceptionally well._
- _As a Sales Manager, I want to ensure **every open opportunity has a next action scheduled**, so that no deal is neglected. I should be able to find deals with no upcoming activities and remind reps to schedule one._
- _As an Account Manager, I want to **set recurring check-in tasks** for my key clients (e.g., monthly call), so I maintain regular contact without having to remember to create a new task each time._
- _As a CRM Admin, I want to **configure default activity types and outcomes**, so that we standardize how reps log interactions (e.g., having consistent options for call outcomes) for better reporting._

### Workflow Diagrams or Logic Flows

**Activity Lifecycle Workflow:**

1. **Creation:** A user creates an activity. This can happen manually (click “Add Activity”, fill form) or via another action (converting a lead might auto-create a follow-up task, etc.). Key input: choose type (Call/Task/etc.), related record(s), due date/time (if applicable), owner (if assigning to someone else or a queue), and notes/description. The activity is saved with status “Open” (or “Scheduled” if a meeting).
2. **Notification/Reminder (optional):** If a due time is nearing and a reminder was set, the system triggers a notification to the owner (popup in CRM, maybe an email alert or mobile push). For example, 15 min before a scheduled call, alert the rep “Upcoming Call with Client X at 3:00 PM.”
3. **Execution & Logging:** The user performs the activity (e.g., calls the client). Right after (or during), they open the activity in CRM, enter outcomes/notes, and mark it as Completed (or use a “Log a Call” quick action which both marks complete and opens fields to fill outcomes). The system stamps the completion date and who did it. If the user never explicitly completes it, and the due date passes, it stays open and becomes overdue.
4. **Follow-up Scheduling:** Often upon completing an activity, the workflow leads to scheduling the next one. For instance, after a call, the rep might immediately click “Schedule next follow-up” and create a new task. Some CRMs prompt: “Completed. Create follow-up activity?” to encourage continuous follow-up. In any case, that leads back to step 1 with a new activity (ensuring continuity in the sales process).
5. **Activity Monitoring:** Managers or users can view at any time the list of activities. For a manager, the workflow might be: open team activity report -> filter to rep or date -> see counts or list -> possibly reassign or comment. For a user: open “My Activities” in morning -> plan and execute -> cross them off as done.
6. **Updating/Rescheduling:** If an activity cannot be done as planned (client postpones meeting, etc.), the user can edit it. Changing the due date (reschedule) or reassign to someone else if needed. The system should log changes in some minimal way (maybe just update fields; a full audit trail is optional but sometimes needed). If a meeting was integrated with calendar, rescheduling should ideally update the calendar invite too.
7. **Closure or Deletion:** If an activity is no longer relevant (lead disqualified, etc.), the user can mark it canceled or delete. Ideally provide a “cancel” or “skip” with reason, to differentiate from completed. If deletion is allowed, maybe restrict to admin or do soft-delete to not lose history. That depends on business preference (often better to have record of everything, so maybe cancellation is better than hard delete).

**Sales Day Workflow Example:** Sales rep logs in, goes to My Work/Activities. They see: 3 calls due today, 2 meetings, 5 tasks. They click the first call (due 9AM), dial the number (maybe using integrated dialer or phone), then afterward hit “Complete”. A pop-up asks for outcome – they choose “Left Voicemail” and type “Left VM, will try again Friday.” They save; that activity now shows as completed with that note. They decide to schedule a follow-up call for Friday – create new Call activity linked to same contact, due Friday 10AM. Move to the next activity, etc. At end of day, they have all done or some pending. Manager can later see that rep completed X out of Y tasks and check the notes quality.

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Add Activity Forms:** There should be an easy way to add an activity from multiple contexts: e.g., a global “+ Activity” button (then user selects contact/deal to link), and contextual “Add Activity” on a contact’s page (which auto-links to that contact). Use a simple form or modal. The form fields adjust slightly for type – e.g., if type=Call, show “Call Outcome” dropdown _after_ completion perhaps, not needed at creation; if type=Meeting, allow adding other attendees maybe. But for initial release, keep it straightforward. Key fields: Title, Type (if not pre-specified by button used), Date/Time (with date-picker and time picker), Assign To (if user can assign to others), Related (choose Lead/Contact or Deal records), Details/Notes. Mark required fields clearly (maybe title and date for tasks, or just title if no date needed).
- **Activity Timeline (Record View):** On a record (lead/contact/deal), show upcoming and past activities in order. A nice UI approach is to show upcoming (open) activities at top or in a separate section, and past (completed) as a history below. For each activity item, display an icon or label for type (📞 for call, 📅 for meeting, ✅ for task, etc.), a short title, due date or completed date. If completed, maybe grey it out or have a checkmark. If notes exist, maybe a preview or an expand option to read full notes. Provide quick actions: e.g., a checkbox to mark complete directly from timeline, or an edit icon to modify. Possibly color-code: overdue in red, upcoming in default, completed in grey/green.
- **“My Activities” (List or Agenda):** Possibly design like an agenda or to-do list. It could be tabular (columns: Due Date, Title, Contact, etc.) or a card list grouped by date (“Today”, “Tomorrow”, “Next 7 days”, “Overdue”). Some CRMs do a dashboard widget like “My Tasks” which just lists items. Perhaps integrate with Feature 14’s “My Work” concept – indeed the prompt mentions “Mobile Access & My Work View” in Feature 14, which likely includes tasks. So on desktop, a “My Work” page or sidebar might list one’s open tasks and meetings. It should allow completing or snoozing tasks easily.
- **Calendar View:** A calendar (monthly/weekly view) can be helpful to visualize meetings/calls. This might be more advanced, but at least a daily agenda or integration with external calendar will serve. If doable, include a simple calendar view in the CRM showing scheduled meetings and calls by date. Drag-and-drop rescheduling on a calendar interface would be great but not required in initial version.
- **Notifications UI:** If in-app notifications are used, create notifications for activity reminders: e.g., “Call with ACME Inc due now” or “Task X is overdue since yesterday.” Also, if someone assigns an activity to you, you should get notified (“Your manager assigned you a task: follow up ACME”). Notification center would list these, with links to the activity or contact. Possibly send email notifications for due tasks each morning or for newly assigned tasks – that could be optional for user.
- **Bulk Complete/Change UI:** Not crucial at start, but maybe allow multi-select in the list to mark done or change dates en masse. Ensure the UI is consistent with other parts if multi-select is supported.
- **Integration in Contact UI:** Possibly highlight if no upcoming activities exist for an open deal/contact (like a subtle warning “No next activity scheduled” to encourage users to add one). This can improve proactiveness. Some CRMs show a badge like “No upcoming tasks” so reps know to schedule something.
- **Mobile UX:** On mobile, activities should be front-and-center as users on the go need to see their tasks and log outcomes immediately after meetings. The “My Work” mobile view (Feature 14) likely highlights assigned tasks. The design should make it easy to tap “Complete” and dictate or type a quick note for outcome. Possibly allow one-tap calls from the mobile app’s activity (tap the phone icon on a Call activity to dial the contact). Keep interfaces simple and quick.
- **Visual Indicators & Collaboration:** Show who completed an activity (maybe in the tooltip or detail: “Completed by \[Name] on \[Date]”). If an activity is assigned to someone else, show their name and maybe avatar next to it. If multiple team members are following one record, seeing each other’s pending tasks could help coordination (maybe allow commenting on an activity or tagging someone – possibly overkill, but think of future collaboration features).
- **Reporting Interface:** Likely formal reports are separate, but perhaps a simple tally on the manager’s dashboard: e.g., “Team Activities This Week: 50 calls, 30 emails, 10 meetings” with breakdown by rep. The UI could present these as numbers or charts (maybe ties into dashboards feature). But at least ensure that data can appear in a customizable dashboard (Feature 4 would allow adding a widget showing count of activities completed).

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

- **Activity Without Date:** Some CRMs allow tasks with no fixed date (just a to-do). If we allow that, define how they show up (maybe in a “No date” list or assume due immediately). It might be simpler to require a date for all tasks to encourage scheduling. If no date is allowed, ensure they don’t slip through cracks – possibly treat them as today’s tasks until dated.
- **Overdue Activities Piling Up:** If a user never marks tasks done, they could accumulate hundreds overdue. The UI should handle that (maybe collapse very old ones or allow bulk closing if they decide to clean up). But more importantly, management should see that and intervene. Not a technical error but a user behavior edge case. Possibly, if tasks are overdue by a very long time (months), the system could auto-archive or prompt “these are stale, do you want to close them?” – but automatic closing might hide problems, so probably not.
- **Deleting Related Records:** If a contact or deal is deleted or converted (lead to contact conversion), what happens to its activities? Business rule typically: do not lose the history. So either transfer activities to the new converted record (for lead conversion, yes, open activities carry to contact/account usually), or if deleting a contact entirely, either prevent deletion if open tasks exist or also delete those tasks (but better to close them out first). Perhaps an admin can delete and chooses to also remove or reassign tasks. Similarly, if an owner user is deactivated, their tasks should be reassigned by admin (to avoid orphan tasks nobody sees). The system should catch orphan tasks – e.g., in queries, exclude tasks for inactive users or prompt admin to redistribute.
- **Time Zone Confusion:** If users in different time zones assign activities to each other, the due time could be confusing. The CRM should handle time zone for each user (likely store times in UTC and display in user’s local). So if a manager in New York sets a call for rep in California at 9AM EST, that rep might see 6AM if not converted – the system should ideally use the assignee’s time zone when scheduling. That can be complex; a simpler approach: treat times as absolute and let them adjust manually. But in meeting invites, time zones definitely matter. Need to decide approach and test that edge.
- **Recurring Tasks Edge Cases:** If implemented, recurrence can be tricky (e.g., what if a monthly call falls on Feb 30?). Likely skip advanced rules if possible at start. Or handle common ones gracefully (choose last day of month for such cases).
- **Integration Failures:** If calendar integration is on, what if the calendar API fails? The CRM should still create the meeting internally and maybe alert user “calendar sync failed, please check connection.” Similarly, if phone dialer integration logs a call but the contact doesn’t exist or network drops – ensure partial logs don’t break stuff. Possibly manual reconciliation may be needed.
- **Simultaneous Edits:** Two users editing the same activity at once (rare, but maybe manager changes due date while rep marks it done). Use standard record locking or last write wins, but ensure it doesn’t create inconsistent state (like one marks done but other’s edit reopens it). Probably low chance scenario; simplest is last action wins, but include a refresh on open maybe.
- **Excessive Activities Impacting Performance:** In some organizations, tasks can be very numerous (hundreds per day per user). The system listing and loading them should use pagination or lazy-load to avoid slow UI. E.g., timeline on a customer with 5 years of daily calls (thousands entries) – maybe load recent by default and allow “load more history.” Same for “My Tasks” – page it if too many open tasks.
- **Logging Calls that Weren’t Scheduled:** Users might directly “Log a Call” that wasn’t pre-scheduled (e.g., an inbound call). The system should allow quick logging of completed activities without requiring prior task creation. Perhaps a “Log Call” button on contact opens a form to enter details and saves it as a completed call activity immediately. This ensures actual interactions are captured even if not planned.
- **Mandatory Logging:** Some companies require certain calls or meetings to be logged before moving sales stages. That might interplay with Feature 10 (workflow rules). E.g., cannot mark an opportunity as Closed if there’s an incomplete task or if last call not logged. This is an advanced business rule beyond core, but ensure the system’s data can be used in such rules.
- **Task Dependency or Order:** Usually tasks are independent, but an edge could be tasks that depend on others (not typical in CRM, more in project management). Likely out of scope, but if a user tries to complete something that should trigger another, consider automation for that.
- **Privacy/Security:** Ensure that if a user should not see another’s activities (e.g., tasks on a contact in a different territory they don’t have access to), those are hidden. Typically, activity visibilities follow the record visibility – i.e., if you can see the contact, you see its activities. If an activity is linked to multiple records with different visibilities, that’s tricky – usually it’s linked to one primary. Business logic probably restricts linking to things you can see anyway. Test that a user cannot retrieve activities through search or reports that they shouldn’t.
- **Activities on Closed Deals:** Some CRMs auto-close or freeze activities when a deal is closed (like marking all open tasks complete or cancel). Maybe not; but consider if an opportunity is marked lost, do we prompt to close its tasks or leave them. Likely leave to user’s discretion.

### Business Rules and Data Integrity Needs

- **Every Deal Has a Next Step:** A recommended practice (which could be enforced via process or just by managerial oversight) is that every open opportunity or lead should have at least one upcoming activity scheduled. We might not enforce it in software by default, but the system’s reporting can highlight ones that violate this. A possible business rule to implement via automation: when an opportunity moves to a certain stage, auto-create a follow-up task, or warn if none exists. Ensuring data integrity here means no active sales prospect is left without an assigned “to-do” – thereby aligning the software to sales process discipline.
- **Standardizing Activity Logging:** For integrity and reporting value, define controlled vocabularies for outcomes and types. E.g., call outcome should be chosen from set options (Connected, Not Connected, Left Voicemail, etc.) rather than free-text, so that reports like “Connected call rate” can be derived. Similarly, if using priority levels or categories for tasks, keep them consistent. The CRM admin may define these picklist values. The business should decide how detailed logs need to be (some require even call duration, etc.). The system captures what’s needed while not overburdening users.
- **Data Retention:** Normally, activities are kept indefinitely as part of contact history (which is valuable). A business rule could be never delete past activities, only mark complete. If needed for performance or clutter reasons, maybe archive those older than X years (but accessible if needed). Ensure deletion is deliberate if at all.
- **Assignment and Ownership:** Activities assigned to a user become part of their work. If that user leaves or territories change, those activities need reassignment. Business rule: Admin must reassign open activities when reassigning accounts or leads to a new owner (some CRMs provide a bulk reassign tool). Data integrity here is making sure no open tasks remain under inactive or incorrect owners, which would otherwise fall through.
- **Workload Balance:** Possibly a business consideration – ensure no user is overloaded. Not enforced by system automatically, but managers might use the system to monitor if one rep has 100 tasks due today while another has 5, and redistribute tasks. If needed, an internal rule could be a max number of tasks auto-assign per day. The system doesn’t enforce but provides data to do so.
- **Integration Consistency:** If integrated with external systems (calendar, phone), ensure that the CRM is the central truth. E.g., if a user deletes a meeting on their Google Calendar, ideally the CRM gets that update and marks the activity canceled. Without integration, this could cause mismatches (CRM shows meeting scheduled but user actually canceled it externally). So either encourage doing those actions in CRM or strong sync. Business rule might be: always schedule customer meetings through CRM to ensure logging.
- **Time Logging (optional):** Some businesses might want to track time spent on activities (especially if doing billable support tasks within CRM). Not typically core CRM, but if needed, ensure notes or durations can be recorded to later sum up. Data integrity: make sure duration field (if present) is consistent (e.g., all in minutes). Not critical unless required by use case.
- **Task Priority:** If using priority (High/Med/Low), define what that means internally (High = must do today, etc.) and possibly filter My Activities by priority. Business rule could be to always set priority for tasks. If we include priority field, default maybe Medium, allow user to change. Not strictly needed but often present.
- **Confidential Activities:** If there’s a need to hide certain notes from others (maybe rare in sales CRM), one might mark an activity as private or only visible to assigned. But in team selling, usually transparency is desired. Decide if any privacy needed; likely not beyond normal role-based access.
- **Linkage to Sales Process:** Perhaps a rule: when an opportunity moves stage, require an activity update. For example, to move to next stage, you must have completed the call in current stage and schedule the next meeting. This is more automation, but ensures process adherence and data completeness at each step (no missing info).

### Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1: Create and Link Activity** – When a user creates a new activity (e.g., a Call) from a contact’s page and saves it, then the activity appears on that contact’s timeline and in the user’s “My Activities” list. _Test:_ Navigate to contact, add an activity with due date today. After saving, verify it shows under that contact with correct details, and also in the user’s task list for today.
- **AC2: Reminder Notification** – If a reminder is set for an activity, then at the configured time, the user receives a notification. _Test:_ Create a task due 10 minutes from now with a 5-minute reminder. Wait 5 minutes – ensure a notification pops up (or email arrives if that’s the mechanism) saying the task is upcoming.
- **AC3: Mark Complete and Outcome Logging** – When an activity is marked completed, it should prompt for outcome/notes (if applicable) and then reflect as completed. _Test:_ Take a scheduled call activity, click “Complete” or similar action. The system should allow entering call result and notes. After saving, the activity should be marked done (checkmark or status changed) on the contact timeline and removed from open tasks list. The notes entered should be visible on the timeline entry. The completion timestamp should be recorded (check that it’s now).
- **AC4: Overdue Highlight** – If an activity’s due date passes without completion, it should be clearly indicated as overdue in user’s view. _Test:_ Create a task due yesterday (can simulate by editing due date or waiting a day). Check “My Activities” – it should either list under “Overdue” section or show in red or an overdue count. The contact’s page might also flag it (maybe an icon). This ensures the user can quickly identify it.
- **AC5: Edit/Reschedule** – When a user edits an existing activity’s details, the changes persist correctly. _Test:_ Take an upcoming meeting, edit the date/time to a day later, and change title slightly. Save. Verify the timeline and task list now reflect the new date and title, and that the old date is replaced. If calendar integration is on in test, check that update carried to external calendar (if applicable).
- **AC6: Assign to Another User** – If a manager or user assigns an activity to another user, then that user can see it on their list and ideally gets a notification. _Test:_ Manager creates a task “Prepare proposal for Client X” and assigns to Sales Rep B. After saving, log in as Rep B (or check impersonation) – Rep B’s tasks should include that item. Also check that Rep B got alerted (maybe an email “New Task assigned to you” or an in-app alert). The contact timeline should show the task with Rep B as owner.
- **AC7: Activity Filtering** – On the activity list or timeline, using filters should work properly. _Test:_ On “My Activities”, filter by type = Call – ensure only call activities show. Filter by status = open vs completed – ensure it splits correctly. On a contact timeline, filter to only show upcoming (some UIs allow hide completed), verify it hides completed ones.
- **AC8: Contact Conversion Carry-over** – (If relevant) When converting a lead to a contact (or similar process), any open activities on the lead should carry to the new contact. _Test:_ Create a lead with an open task. Convert lead to contact. After conversion, go to the new contact – the task should now be associated with contact (and maybe the old lead record is retired). This ensures continuity of follow-ups through sales stages.
- **AC9: Reporting Accuracy** – If we have a simple report or count: e.g., _Test:_ Complete 2 calls and 1 meeting as a user today. The manager’s dashboard or a report of “activities completed today by user” should reflect 3 for that user, and breakdown by type correct. If no formal reports UI to test, at least verify that a query or list of completed activities can be generated with those entries. This tests that data is logged correctly in the system (status, types, etc.).
- **AC10: Calendar Sync (if implemented)** – Schedule a meeting via CRM for a specific time and invite (if system sends invites) or sync to Google/Outlook. _Test:_ After creation, check the user’s external calendar – the event should appear with correct details (title, time, participants). If user accepts external invite, CRM doesn’t necessarily need that but if two-way sync is on, ensure no duplicates or weird offsets. If external update is made (time changed on Google Calendar), check if CRM updated too (if we claim two-way).
- **AC11: Bulk or Multi-Add** (if applicable) – If multiple selection or bulk actions exist: _Test:_ Select 3 tasks in list, mark complete in one go. Verify all three now show as done with current timestamp. Or select multiple contacts and add a “Email follow-up” task to all – verify each contact got a separate task. If bulk not available, mark this NA.
- **AC12: Access Control** – Ensure a user cannot see or edit activities they shouldn’t. _Test:_ If Contact A is owned by Rep A, and Rep B has no access to that contact, then Rep B should not see Contact A’s activities in any list (even if assigned by mistake or something). Also test that if an activity is on an opportunity in one territory, a rep from another without access cannot pull it up via search (shouldn’t find it). Essentially, security rights on records propagate to their activities.
- **AC13: Activity Cancellation** – If we allow cancel/delete: _Test:_ Mark an open task as “Canceled” or delete it. It should disappear from open lists, and perhaps in the contact timeline it might show as canceled (or not show at all if deletion). Check that once canceled, it’s not counted as overdue or open anywhere. If deletion is allowed, ensure that works and maybe verify it doesn’t orphan references (like any notification or calendar event should ideally be cleared).
- **AC14: Recurring Task (if implemented)** – Create a recurring task (e.g., daily for 3 occurrences). _Test:_ Save and see that system created a series (some CRMs generate all or generate next one after one is done). If generating all, ensure all appear appropriately (with sequence dates). Complete one occurrence – ensure it doesn’t mark the future ones done. If pattern is until certain date, ensure none beyond. This is complex; if recurrence not done, skip.

## Feature 4: Customizable Dashboards

### Scope and Overview

**Scope:** Provide interactive, customizable dashboards within the CRM where users (especially managers and executives) can visualize key metrics and KPIs through various widgets (charts, tables, summary numbers) aggregated from CRM data. Each user should be able to configure their own dashboards (and possibly shared team dashboards) by selecting which reports or data to display, arranging the layout, and applying filters. The dashboards pull real-time or periodically refreshed data from the CRM (sales pipeline, activities, lead conversion rates, etc.) and present it in digestible visual formats (bar charts, funnel charts, line graphs, etc.). The scope includes a library of widget types (e.g., charts, lists, KPIs) and the ability to customize each (choose data source, metrics, groupings) as well as the overall dashboard layout (grid-based drag-and-drop or similar).

**Overview:** Customizable Dashboards empower users to monitor performance at a glance by aggregating the most pertinent data in one view. For example, a Sales Manager’s dashboard might include: total sales this month, pipeline by stage (funnel chart), top 10 open deals, activities by rep, and forecast vs target. A support manager might have: tickets open vs closed, customer satisfaction scores, etc., but since this CRM is sales-focused, we primarily anticipate sales and marketing metrics. Users should be able to add pre-built widgets for common metrics and also create custom reports to pin on dashboards. The UI should be highly visual and interactive (e.g., clicking on a chart segment could drill down to the underlying records). Customization extends to renaming dashboards, setting one as default homepage, and sharing with roles (so everyone in a team sees a standard dashboard for consistency). The aim is to give each persona the **information that matters to them, in real time, accessible in a single screen**, without having to run individual reports every time. This ultimately helps in decision-making and keeping track of goals.

### Target Users and Personas

- **Sales Managers/Directors:** Primary consumers who track team performance and pipeline health. They will customize dashboards to see key sales KPIs (revenue, pipeline size, win rates, leaderboard) at a glance. _Persona Goal:_ “As a Sales Director, I want a dashboard that shows me my team’s sales pipeline, progress to quota, and recent sales activities in one view, so I can identify issues or opportunities quickly without digging through reports.”
- **Executives (VP Sales, CEO):** They may use high-level dashboards for oversight (company-wide sales figures, forecasts vs goals, maybe across regions or products). They likely rely on summarized charts prepared by others or built themselves if hands-on. _Persona Goal:_ “As a CEO, I want a top-level sales dashboard summarizing bookings, pipeline, and growth trends, so I have real-time visibility into company performance for strategic decisions.”
- **Sales Representatives:** Some might use personal dashboards to track their own performance (their sales to date, their pipeline, leaderboard rank) and key tasks. _Persona Goal:_ “As a Sales Rep, I want to see my sales stats and pipeline on a dashboard to motivate myself and manage my funnel, and perhaps a leaderboard to know where I stand.”
- **Marketing Managers:** If CRM also captures leads and campaigns, they may have a dashboard for lead volume, conversion rates, campaign ROI. _Persona Goal:_ “As a Marketing Manager, I want to see leads generated, conversion to opportunities, and email campaign metrics on a dashboard, to measure marketing effectiveness in real time.”
- **Customer Success Managers:** If included, dashboards on renewals, churn, NPS could be desired, but focus likely on sales CRM.
- **CRM Administrators/Analysts:** They often set up standard dashboards for others. They need flexibility to create and distribute dashboards. _Persona Goal:_ “As a CRM Admin or Analyst, I want to create standardized dashboards for the sales team (e.g., pipeline review dashboard) and share it, ensuring everyone uses consistent metrics and we can easily update it centrally.”

### Functional Requirements and User Stories

**Functional Requirements:**

- **Multiple Dashboards & Navigation:** The system shall allow users to create and manage multiple dashboards. For example, a user might have a “Sales Overview” dashboard and another “Detailed Pipeline” dashboard. Provide an intuitive way to switch between dashboards (tabs or a dropdown of dashboard names). Allow naming dashboards and setting one as the default landing page if desired.
- **Add/Remove Dashboard Widgets (Tiles):** Users can add new widgets to a dashboard from a gallery or by building from scratch. Widget types should include at least: **Chart** (bar, line, pie, funnel, etc.), **Metric/KPI** (a single number with maybe comparison), **Table/List** (e.g., list of top deals or tasks), and possibly **Text/Goal** (display a static note or target for reference). Users should be able to remove any widget they added or edit its settings.
- **Widget Configuration (Data Source & Filters):** For each widget, the user can select what data it represents. This might integrate with a reporting or query builder. For example, to create a chart: choose a module (e.g., Opportunities), define a measure (sum of Deal Amount or count of records), define a dimension/grouping (e.g., by Stage for a bar chart, or by Owner for a leaderboard). They should also apply filters (e.g., only include deals where Close Date is this quarter, or Stage = Open). Essentially, a simplified report builder UI. The system should provide common presets for ease (like “Pipeline by Stage” template).
- **Chart Types and Options:** Common chart types needed: Bar/Column (for comparisons of categories), Line/Area (for trends over time, e.g., monthly sales), Pie/Donut (for proportions, though often less info-dense), **Funnel** (special type for pipeline drop-off), and **Leaderboard** (which is basically a bar chart sorted descending by value, e.g., sales by rep, akin to Feature 16 – likely implemented via the same chart logic). Each chart should have configurable settings: e.g., show top N values, choose sorting, show data labels or not, choose color palette if possible. The default should be smart (e.g., distinct colors per category, readable labels).
- **KPI/Number Widgets:** For a single metric display, user selects an aggregate (sum, count, avg) and filter. E.g., “Total Open Opportunities: 42”. Optionally show a comparison to a previous period or target (e.g., an arrow up/down or percentage vs last month). This requires the system to handle date filters or a target input. Possibly allow the user to input a static target number for the widget to compare against (like a goal).
- **Table/List Widgets:** Allow listing records that meet criteria, with chosen columns, limited to maybe top 5 or 10 due to space. For example, “Top 10 Deals by Amount” listing Deal Name and Amount. Or “Upcoming Closings” listing deals closing this month. This requires a mini-report of records sorted by some field. The user config: pick object, filter, sort by a field, choose columns to display, limit N. Clicking an entry should navigate to that record.
- **Layout Customization:** Users should be able to arrange widgets on the dashboard. This typically means drag-and-drop positioning on a grid. Possibly choose column spans or sizes. At minimum, allow reordering vertically and maybe choose between a 1-column or 2-column layout. Ideally, a flexible grid where they can make some charts wider than others, etc. Responsive design should ensure it looks decent on different screen sizes (maybe stacking on small screens).
- **Real-Time or Refreshable Data:** The data shown on dashboards should update to reflect current CRM information. If not truly real-time, provide a refresh mechanism. Possibly auto-refresh every X minutes for an on-screen dashboard (maybe optional), and definitely allow manual refresh (a refresh button that re-queries data for all widgets or each widget). If data caching is used for performance, ensure it’s reasonably fresh or user can force an update.
- **Drill-down and Interactivity:** Clicking on a chart segment or number should allow the user to see the underlying data. For instance, clicking a bar representing “Deals in Proposal Stage = 5” could open a list of those 5 deals (perhaps navigate to a pre-filtered list view or a temporary popup list). This makes the dashboard actionable. Similarly, clicking a KPI number could open the full report of those records. If drill-down is too advanced, at least have the ability to link a widget to an existing saved report or list view.
- **Sharing and Permissions:** Support the concept of **shared dashboards** for teams or roles. A manager might design a “Team Pipeline Dashboard” and share it with all sales team members. Those members can view (but maybe not edit) that dashboard. Alternatively, admin can create some default dashboards visible to certain roles (e.g., a default Sales Rep dashboard vs a Manager dashboard). This requires a permissions model: e.g., dashboards can be private (only owner), shared (with specific users/roles/team or globally). Possibly allow setting a dashboard as homepage for certain roles by admin.
- **Default Templates:** Out-of-the-box, provide a few template dashboards or recommended widgets to help new users. For example, a “Sales Manager Starter Dashboard” might include: total sales (KPI), pipeline by stage (funnel), top deals (table), activities by rep (bar). These can be pre-built such that a user can select a template on create. They should be further editable by the user after creation.
- **Cross-filtering (Nice-to-have):** In advanced BI, clicking one chart can filter others (e.g., click “Region = West” bar and the rest of charts filter to West). This is complex and maybe out-of-scope for initial release, but if any simple filtering across dashboard is possible, it’s a plus. Perhaps a global filter at dashboard level: e.g., a date range selector that applies to all widgets if relevant. Could consider implementing a global filter like “This Quarter vs Last Quarter” toggle that all widgets respect if configured to do so. If too complex, skip for now.
- **Responsive & Exporting:** The dashboard should be viewable on different screen sizes, adjusting layout (e.g., on a mobile maybe widgets stack vertically, though detailed charts might be tough to read – possibly we expect dashboard usage mostly on web). Also, ability to **export or print** a dashboard (to PDF or image) is often requested for presentations. At least ensure that printing the page yields a decent result (or provide an export PDF option). That could be acceptance criteria if feasible: managers often want to include a dashboard snapshot in meetings.
- **Integrate Non-CRM Data (Future):** Out-of-scope now, but note potential extension: if integration hub is strong, might allow feeding external metrics (like from Google Analytics or something) into a widget. Not doing that initially, just focusing on CRM data.
- **Security of Data in Dashboard:** Ensure that a user’s dashboard respects their data permissions. E.g., if a sales rep can only see their own deals, even if a shared dashboard has “Total Sales for Company”, they should only see their share or maybe not be allowed to have such a broad widget. Usually, metrics aggregate over all data the viewer has access to. Possibly, an admin-shared dashboard might have pre-aggregated numbers intended for all (which might reveal global data to someone without underlying access). This could be tricky – likely best to enforce that all queries in widgets obey the viewer’s normal record-level access. So if a rep has access only to their deals, a “Total Company Sales” widget for them would effectively sum only their deals – which might not be what the manager intended if they shared it. Alternatively, restrict sharing such that only managers (with full visibility) get the manager dashboard. This needs clarity in design and documentation for user expectations.

**User Stories:**

- _As a Sales Manager, I want to **build a custom dashboard** with charts of our sales pipeline, closed sales this month, and activities, so that I can monitor my team’s progress in real-time without running multiple reports._
- _As a Sales Manager, I want to **drag and arrange** these charts on the screen to highlight the most important metrics at the top, and have less critical ones below, to create a tailored visual summary._
- _As a Sales Manager, I want to **click on a chart segment** (like a bar for one sales rep’s sales) and see the list of deals behind that number, so I can quickly drill down to investigate issues or opportunities._
- _As a VP of Sales, I want to have a **company-wide sales dashboard** that I can share with the executive team, so that everyone sees the same up-to-date figures on revenue, pipeline, and forecasts and stays aligned._
- _As a Sales Rep, I want a **personal dashboard** showing my performance (my sales vs quota, my pipeline funnel, and my ranking on the leaderboard) to motivate myself and identify where to focus._
- _As a Marketing Manager, I want to create a **leads dashboard** to track how many leads are coming in each week and how they convert to opportunities, so I can gauge campaign effectiveness on the fly._
- _As a CRM Admin, I want to **pre-configure standard dashboards** for new users by role, ensuring that when a new sales rep logs in, they have a useful default dashboard without needing to build one from scratch._
- _As a Sales Analyst, I want to use the dashboard to **present monthly results** in meetings, so the ability to export or present it on a big screen (with real-time data) would help share insights clearly._

1. **Create Dashboard:** User navigates to Dashboard section and clicks “Create New Dashboard”. They are prompted to name it (e.g., “My Sales KPIs”). Possibly, they choose a template or a blank slate. If templates exist, selecting one auto-adds some widgets. Otherwise, they start empty.
2. **Add Widget:** User clicks “Add Widget” (or “+” in an empty area). A gallery or form appears: it asks for widget type (Chart, KPI, Table, etc.). User selects Chart. Then it walks them through configuring the chart: choose data source (e.g., Opportunities module), then choose measure (e.g., sum of Amount), choose dimension (Stage field), maybe choose chart style (funnel or bar for stage distribution). They might apply a filter (Stage is not Closed Lost, or Close Date in current quarter, etc.). A preview is generated showing what the chart will look like with current data. The user saves the widget. It appears on the dashboard.
3. **Arrange Widget:** The new widget might appear in a default position. The user can drag it to a desired spot or resize if supported. They continue adding other widgets: maybe a KPI widget (set data = sum of Amount where Closed Won and Close Date = this month, call it “Sales This Month”), maybe a list of “Top 5 Deals” (choose Opportunities sorted by amount descending, limit 5, columns: Name and Amount). They position those accordingly.
4. **Customize Appearance:** They may edit widget titles (e.g., rename “Sum of Amount by Stage” to “Pipeline by Stage”). They can change chart colors or type if the system allows (maybe switch a bar to pie, etc.). They might also adjust the overall layout (maybe toggle between a 2-column or 3-column grid if offered, or simply drag to desired width if a free-form grid). The system auto-saves the layout and config.
5. **View Mode & Refresh:** Once done, the user exits edit mode (if there is one) to view mode. Now the data displays without configuration UI. They see their charts with updated numbers. The dashboard might fetch new data on load or at intervals. If they keep it open during the day, they might hit a refresh button to get updated figures after some sales came in.
6. **Interaction:** The user clicks on “Pipeline by Stage” funnel’s Proposal stage. The system responds by either opening a list page filtered to Stage=Proposal, or perhaps a popup showing those deals. The user examines details. Similarly, clicking the KPI “Sales This Month: \$X” could open the report of all deals closed this month. These might use the existing reporting module or a quick filter, but the experience should be smooth.
7. **Sharing Dashboard:** The user (if manager) decides to share this dashboard with peers or subordinates. They go into a share menu, select share with Role = Sales Team. They might give it a common name. Now each team member sees this dashboard under a “Shared with me” section, or if allowed, the user can set it as their default too.
8. **Switch Dashboard:** Another scenario, the user has multiple dashboards. They can switch via a tab or menu. E.g., go to “Team Dashboard” vs “My Dashboard”. The state of each (widgets, filters) is preserved individually. If they want to edit or delete a widget, they go into edit mode for that dashboard.
9. **Ongoing Maintenance:** Over time, the user might modify widgets (e.g., update the filter from “this quarter” to “next quarter” once quarter passes, or adjust a sales target number). They might also remove widgets that aren’t needed or add new ones (like a new chart for a new metric). These steps essentially reuse the above add/edit workflow.
10. **Access Control Check:** If a user has limited data access, when they view a shared dashboard, each widget should query only their visible data. The system might internally attach user’s visibility filters to each query. If a widget results in no data for them (e.g., a rep viewing a company-wide summary might only see their deals in it), it might show a smaller number which is fine. Or if allowed, the share might be intended only for managers who see all. So likely, share with roles of similar privilege.
11. **Remove Dashboard:** If user no longer needs one, they can delete it (with confirmation). Shared ones might only be deletable by the owner or admin.

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Dashboard Home UI:** The dashboards area should have a clear entry point in navigation (e.g., “Dashboards” or could be default home upon login for some). If multiple dashboards, maybe tabs along the top or a left-side list of dashboard names. A button to create new dashboard should be visible. For first-time users, showing templates or help (“Create your first dashboard”) is good.
- **Widget Addition UI:** Use a wizard or modal to guide through adding a widget. Possibly split into steps: 1) Choose widget type/template (maybe provide premade ones like “Pipeline Funnel” – user picks and it’s mostly configured for them, just confirm filters), OR let them do custom by selecting object and fields. Could be as minimal as integrating with an existing “report builder” if one exists, but ideally streamlined for dashboard use. Real-time preview is important to ensure they know what they’ll get.
- **Editing Mode:** It might be helpful to have an explicit “Edit Dashboard” mode toggled by a button, where the grid becomes draggable and an edit icon appears on each widget. In view mode, dragging might accidentally move things, so better to lock unless in edit mode. In edit mode, allow resizing (maybe dragging corners to span more columns or a slider for width if a grid with columns). Show a grid background or snap lines. Each widget can have controls: Edit (to reconfigure data or appearance), Delete (remove widget), maybe Duplicate (to copy config for slight variation). Provide a Done/Save button to exit edit mode (auto-saving changes though).
- **Visual Consistency:** Widgets should have a clean card appearance with a header (title of widget, possibly icons for refresh/edit in corner). The charts should be rendered clearly (using a chart library that handles labels, scaling). Use distinct colors for chart series or segments (preferably using a palette that is colorblind-friendly if possible). KPI widgets can be large numbers with maybe a subtitle (like “vs last month: +5%”). If a number is good/bad, could optionally color it (green if positive growth, red if negative – if context known).
- **Table widgets:** They should look like mini-tables, maybe with a scroll if too many rows. Keep them concise. Possibly allow expanding a table widget to see more in a popup if needed.
- **Responsiveness:** On smaller screens or if window is resized, perhaps the widgets stack vertically or in fewer columns. Ensure charts remain legible when narrower (some libraries will adjust label positions or abbreviate labels). Possibly hide some chart legends if too narrow or allow horizontal scroll for wide tables. The design should degrade gracefully.
- **Global Filters (if any):** If implementing global date filter, could place a date range picker at top of dashboard that can apply to any widget configured to respect it. If not, ensure each widget has its own filter context clearly indicated (like, a small subtitle or tooltip saying “Data: This Quarter” so user knows what they’re looking at).
- **Tooltip and Legend on Charts:** When hovering data points, tooltips with exact values should appear. Legends should identify categories (especially on multi-series or pie charts). Provide ways to handle too many categories (e.g., group as “Other” or have a scrollable legend if there are many entries). Typically dashboards avoid extremely granular charts for clarity.
- **Empty State:** If a widget’s query returns no data (e.g., “No deals match criteria”), display a friendly “No data to display” in that widget, rather than just blank. If a chart with no data, perhaps an empty chart outline with message.
- **Load/Refresh Feedback:** When loading or refreshing, indicate it (spinning indicator overlay on the widget perhaps). So user knows data is fetching. If any widget fails to load (maybe query error), show an error state (“Error loading data”) possibly with option to retry. Failures might occur if user lacks permission or query was misconfigured (rare if UI prevents bad config, but e.g., if a field used in chart was deleted from schema, maybe an error).
- **Sharing UI:** A “Share” button or menu on the dashboard with options like “Share with Team/Role/User”. Possibly open a dialog to pick users or roles. Also consider a toggle “Make this my team’s default”. Show icons or text marking a dashboard as shared. Also list shared ones separate from personal: e.g., in dashboard selection list, maybe section “My Dashboards” vs “Shared with me”. Provide clarity who created a shared one if multiple appear.
- **Guidance and Defaults:** Since not all users are data-savvy, the UI could guide by providing sample metrics. Possibly have a library of pre-built widgets in lay terms: e.g., “Total Open Opportunities”, “Pipeline by Stage”, “Top Deals by Value”, “Activities by User”, etc. Users can pick from those without configuring fields individually. That would improve usability a lot. Under the hood, those correspond to known field configurations.
- **Integration with Reports module:** If a fuller Report builder exists separately (maybe in this product or future), allow adding a saved report as a widget. E.g., if user made a complex report elsewhere, they can pin its chart to dashboard. If not now, at least design with that extension in mind.
- **Security in UI:** If a user with restricted access is viewing a shared dashboard that references data they cannot see, either show them only what they can (preferred) or indicate some info hidden. The UI should not inadvertently show aggregate numbers that reveal data beyond their scope. E.g., if rep sees “Company Sales: \$1M” but they only contributed \$100k and they wonder who did the rest, that might be intended if managers want transparency, but if not, could be sensitive. Likely, such a shared view is only given to those allowed. So might document: share dashboards with those who have the necessary data visibility to interpret them.
- **Performance and Limits:** If extremely large data sets, charts should aggregate server-side. The UI should not try to load thousands of data points raw. Summaries via queries ensure performance. Possibly impose a limit on categories shown (like top 50 categories max in a chart). Inform user if data truncated (“showing top 50 of 200 – refine filter for more detail” maybe in a tooltip).
- **Evergreen vs Static Data Range:** Some widgets might be for “this month” which changes as time passes. The system should interpret relative date filters (like “this month”) dynamically. Also possibly allow fixed ranges (like “Jan 2025” if user explicitly sets). UI should clarify if it’s dynamic or fixed. E.g., if it says “This Month” then on Feb 1 it automatically shows Feb data.

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

- **Complex Query Limits:** The UI may restrict certain combinations to avoid confusion. For example, if a user tries to chart something non-summable (like text field values count with too many unique entries leading to dozens of bars), the system might either allow and just show a huge chart or warn “Too many categories, please refine filter or choose another grouping”. Or automatically group small ones as “Other” if possible.
- **Field Deletion or Rename:** If underlying data fields or objects change (like admin renames a field or deletes a custom field used in a widget), the widget might break or show incorrect info. Ideally, if field is deleted, widget should show an error or remove itself gracefully. If renamed, hopefully it auto-updates to new name, but the title might not since user could have custom titled it. This requires some maintenance mechanism or admin cleanup. Possibly, have a hidden ID link so rename doesn’t break the query. But deletion likely can’t be resolved – maybe an admin gets notified or it just errors out.
- **Permission Changes:** If a user’s role changes such that they lose rights to some data on their dashboard, it might go blank or partially blank. E.g., a rep was promoted to manager or vice versa. The system should recalc based on current perms, which could dramatically change numbers. That’s expected behavior (not exactly error). Possibly, if they lose access entirely to an object, their widget might fail (like if they no longer have access to opportunities object at all, their pipeline chart can’t run). The UI could show “No access to data” message in widget to them.
- **Data Volume Issues:** Some charts like line charts by day over years can have many points. We should perhaps cap how granular (like if user tries to chart daily leads over 5 years, that’s \~1825 points – maybe okay, but more might clutter). Possibly either limit date grouping to certain spans or aggregate (like if > X points, auto group by week or month). Or allow but with performance considerations. Similarly, pie charts with too many slices become unreadable – maybe automatically only show top 10 slices and combine rest as “Other”. Ensure such logic doesn’t confuse user – maybe mention it.
- **Concurrent Edits:** If two users share a dashboard and both try to edit, or if a user has the same dashboard open in two tabs editing, could cause conflicts. Perhaps treat shared dashboards as only editable by owner (others can clone it if they want modifications). If multi-edit needed, perhaps lock when someone is editing (rare scenario). Document to users that if they change a shared one, it changes for everyone it’s shared with (unless per-user filters are applied).
- **Deleting Underlying Records:** If a widget shows top deals and one deal is closed out or deleted, the next refresh will simply not show it (if closed and filter excludes closed, it disappears). That’s fine. If a deal on a top list is deleted from CRM, the widget might error if it specifically needed some field from it. But mostly, aggregated queries aren’t listing specific records by ID except lists which then see one less row – that should be okay (maybe on deletion, the list might try to show a record that no longer exists – ensure it doesn’t break, just omit it).
- **Offline/Load Fail:** If user is offline or server can’t be reached, the dashboard might show “cannot load data” or stale data. Provide user feedback to refresh later. Not too different from any web data loading errors.
- **Large Screen vs Small Screen Layout:** On extremely large screens, maybe user wants many widgets visible. If we have a set grid width, maybe allow more columns or fluid expansion. If not, there might be wasted space. Perhaps we consider making it fluid up to a certain max width. Minor issue. On small mobile screens, detail charts might not be useful, maybe could hide some charts and show only KPI numbers. But we likely don’t emphasize full dashboard on phone; still, ensure it doesn’t completely break.
- **User Confusion with Configuration:** Building charts can be tricky. We should try to label fields clearly (maybe include field labels instead of internal names, etc.). Use understandable names in templates. If a user configures something nonsensical (like summing a text field, which doesn’t apply), the UI should prevent selection or auto-switch to count. Or if grouping by a continuous number field, maybe encourage bucketing (not likely implemented first, but if someone tries grouping by Opportunity Amount raw, they might get one bar per deal which is not useful – better to group by range, but that’s advanced. We likely don’t do automatic bucketing, so maybe restrict group by to picklist/date/user fields rather than free numeric fields to avoid weird output). Possibly allow grouping by numeric if use-case is count per each exact value which is rarely meaningful.
- **Many Series Chart:** E.g., user might want a line chart of sales per month split by region (so multiple lines). If implemented, ensure legend handles multiple series, each region line distinct color. If too many lines, it might become clutter. Possibly advise using filter or allow up to certain number. The UI should at least remain functional, maybe cropping some.
- **Data Sync Timing:** If data is updating (like new sales being logged), a user might see a number on dashboard slightly outdated. Typically, if we query live from DB on refresh, it’s fine. If a caching layer or data warehouse with delays is used (common in very large systems), clarify that data is refreshed hourly or so. But likely we can query live CRM data since volumes might be moderate. So assume near real-time. If some stat seems off, user can refresh. If still off, maybe they lack permission to see some data, not a bug per se.
- **Internationalization:** If we have multi-currency or languages, ensure numbers format properly (commas, decimal, currency symbol). E.g., if pipeline has mixed currencies, and we sum amounts, maybe all amounts converted to base currency by default for chart? Ideally yes, or require filter to one currency. That’s a subtle point: summing a field that has currency differences might yield misleading sum. Possibly, if multi-currency, either convert behind scenes or disallow mixing. At minimum, maybe the admin defines a default currency for reporting. Similarly, date formats, etc., should follow user locale.
- **Logout/Session**: If the user is on a dashboard and session times out, maybe the refresh stops working – normal login flow to handle that, not specific to dashboards aside from maybe it showing an error that might confuse. But no major differences from other pages.

### Business Rules and Data Integrity Needs

- **Accurate Aggregation**: Business must trust the dashboard numbers, so ensure that the logic for summing or counting is consistent with how other parts of CRM calculate (e.g., closed deals sum includes only Closed Won stage, matches any other reports). If any custom business logic (like “Bookings” exclude certain deal types), the dashboard either should allow replicating that via filters, or we might need to incorporate those definitions (like maybe have preset “Bookings” measure if it’s defined specially). Data integrity means one source of truth – ideally the dashboard queries the same data tables as list views and reports, so no discrepancies.
- **Data Permissions**: As mentioned, enforce record-level security on the data shown so that dashboards don’t become a loophole to see unauthorized data. This is critical: e.g., a rep should not see another’s pipeline by just making a widget for all opportunities if they normally can’t see those records. The system should implicitly filter to what rep can access. That rule might frustrate a rep trying to replicate a manager’s view (they’ll just see lower totals), but that’s correct by policy. If global transparency is desired, they could be given read rights broadly or use a share where we intentionally allow them to see summary. But typically summary is still derived from restricted sets if we follow strict security model. We should communicate that clearly to users (maybe in help text: “Data shown is limited to records you have permission to view.”).
- **Up-to-date Goals**: If using target metrics (like quotas), ensure those are entered properly (maybe as custom fields or a goal management feature). The business should update targets each period so dashboard comparisons remain meaningful. If using static targets, someone needs to maintain them. Possibly link to a "Quota" field per user and allow KPI to compare actual sales vs that field, which is set by management. Data integrity: quotas must be loaded, else comparisons are off or show 0.
- **One Version of Truth**: If multiple dashboards can be created, business should define which is official for certain metrics. There might be slight differences if users configure differently. E.g., one user’s “sales this quarter” might exclude something another includes. To avoid confusion, many companies prefer centrally created dashboards for official reporting. Thus, an admin should have ability to lock certain shared dashboards so individuals don’t inadvertently tweak them into showing different numbers. Business rule could be: official dashboards are read-only to end users. They can create personal ones for other things, but the official one is how management expects the numbers. Ensure the product supports that by sharing read-only.
- **Audit and Change Management**: Possibly log when a dashboard or widget is created/edited, especially shared ones, for audit trail. In case someone complains “the number changed or seems off”, an admin can see if someone changed the filter. Not user-facing, but a consideration for data integrity and troubleshooting.
- **Backup of Config**: Maybe not critical, but if a user accidentally deletes a complex dashboard, no data lost except config. Still, might be nice if an admin can recover or recreate – not a typical requirement unless many rely on it. Perhaps encourage saving as template or duplicate before drastic changes.
- **Data Privacy**: If metrics derive from personally identifiable info or sensitive deals, ensure aggregations don't inadvertently expose something sensitive. Usually, sums and counts are fine, but e.g., if some deals are confidential, perhaps they should be excluded from a general pipeline by security anyway. So consistent application of data privacy rules via security model covers it.
- **Performance vs Accuracy**: If dealing with huge data, some systems might approximate or cache. We should aim for accurate counts, even if it’s slightly slower. Business would prefer wait 5 seconds for correct number rather than instant but possibly stale by hours or approximate. Unless data is enormous, real-time queries on sales data should be fine.
- **Dashboard Availability**: The dashboards should be available whenever data is available. If some jobs (like nightly processing) are needed, ensure those complete before morning if affecting data. Possibly not relevant if direct queries. If for example forecasting data is computed nightly, any widget using it might not update until job done – should note such dependencies.
- **Time Zone and Fiscal Calendar**: Business might have a fiscal year offset or custom quarter definitions. The dashboard date filters should align with those (if fiscal year starts in April, Q1 = Apr-Jun, etc.). Possibly allow admin to configure fiscal calendar so “This Quarter” filter uses that. Data integrity for time-based aggregations relies on correct understanding of periods. If not using fiscal, standard calendar quarter is fine.
- **Multi-currency handling**: If CRM has multiple currencies for deals, and a manager wants a total pipeline value, presumably there’s a concept of base currency or the widget should sum in one currency (like convert all to USD). That business rule (summing multi-currency) should be defined: typically, CRM can convert to user’s default currency for reports. Ensure the widget does same to maintain consistency with other reports. Document how it works.
- **Scheduled Snapshots (maybe)**: Some businesses like to snapshot dashboard metrics at certain times (like end of month values). This is more of an analytics extension. Our feature likely just shows live data. If they need historical snapshots, they either trust they captured by EOM, or use an export. Possibly out-of-scope to provide automated snapshot archives. That might come with a reporting module or analytics add-on. Just note if asked: not included initially.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1: Add Widget & Display Data** – Given a user has data in the CRM, when they add a dashboard widget (for example, a bar chart of Opportunities by Stage), and configure it, then upon saving, the widget appears on the dashboard with a correct representation of the data. _Test:_ If currently there are 10 opps in Proposal, 5 in Negotiation, the chart should show those counts accurately. Verify that if one of those opps is moved to another stage and the widget is refreshed, it updates accordingly (counts adjust).
- **AC2: Multiple Widget Layout** – When a user adds multiple widgets (e.g., a chart and a KPI and a list) and arranges them, then the layout change is preserved and the dashboard displays all widgets without overlap or truncation. _Test:_ Drag a widget to reorder, maybe resize if supported, refresh the page – the layout should persist. Check that at typical screen resolution, all widgets are fully visible (no parts cut off unless intended by small sizes).
- **AC3: Data Filter Accuracy** – If a user sets a filter on a widget (e.g., only include deals where Close Date is this quarter), then the widget’s data reflects that filter and excludes others. _Test:_ If there’s an opportunity from last year, verify it’s not counted in a “This Quarter” chart. Conversely, include a current one and see it appear. Change the filter to something else (like last quarter) and see the data change to those records only.
- **AC4: Drill-through Function** – Clicking on a segment of a chart or on a KPI should lead to the underlying data. _Test:_ On a “Pipeline by Stage” bar chart, click the bar for “Proposal”. The system should bring up either a list view or a modal listing all proposals. Check that the list matches the count (if bar said 5, list shows those 5 records). Also test a KPI: if “Total Open Leads = 20”, clicking it maybe opens the Leads list filtered to open status – confirm it shows \~20 leads. The navigation should be correct (no error or wrong filter).
- **AC5: KPI Comparison (if implemented)** – If a KPI widget is configured to show comparison (e.g., vs previous period), ensure it calculates correctly. _Test:_ If “Sales This Month” is \$100k and “Last Month” was \$80k, it might show +25%. Confirm the math. If last month was 0, maybe it should handle (no % or just show +100% or infinite – define fallback). If target is provided (like goal \$120k, actual \$100k), if the widget can show progress, check it displays maybe 83% of goal or a red indicator. If these features not implemented, skip.
- **AC6: Table Widget Sorting & Links** – If a list widget is added (e.g., Top 5 Deals by amount), the listed records should be correctly sorted and each should link to the record. _Test:_ Confirm the deals are in descending order by amount and only 5 show. Click a deal name – ensure it opens that opportunity’s detail page. Also test that if you specify certain columns, those show up properly in the list.
- **AC7: Sharing and Permissions** – If a dashboard is shared with another user, that user should see it under their dashboards, with data filtered to their permissions. _Test:_ Manager shares “Team Pipeline” with a rep. Log in as rep: verify “Team Pipeline” appears. If the rep only has access to their deals, the numbers/charts should correspond to only their subset. For example, if manager sees total pipeline \$500k across team, and rep’s own deals are \$100k of that, rep’s view might show \$100k (assuming row-level security is applied). Confirm that rep does not see others’ deals listed in any list widget or drill-down – any list should either be empty or just their records. (This might be tricky if manager intended them to see full – but by our rule, they won’t. Check that it doesn’t show blank or error but just limited data). Also ensure the rep cannot edit the manager’s shared dashboard (if we restrict that) – ideally they can view but not save changes to it. Try moving a widget as rep – either not allowed or it doesn’t persist for others.
- **AC8: Default Dashboard** – If a user sets a dashboard as default (or admin sets for role), when that user logs in or goes to home, that dashboard is the first thing they see. _Test:_ Mark “My Sales” as default, then navigate away and back (or log out/in) – it should open that one directly, not the generic one. If admin assigns a default to new users, create a new user as sales rep, log in, see if that dashboard loads by default.
- **AC9: Template Use** – If templates are provided, selecting one should create a dashboard with pre-filled widgets that show data correctly. _Test:_ Choose “Sales Manager Template”. It creates, say, 4 widgets. Verify those widgets display properly with the sample org data. If an expected metric is missing (like if no data for something, maybe a widget says “0 or No data” – that might be fine as long as it’s correct). The user should be able to then edit those widgets if desired, verifying they function just like manually created ones.
- **AC10: Real-time Update** – Make a change in underlying data and see it reflect on dashboard refresh. _Test:_ If the dashboard has “Open Leads count”, add a new open lead record in CRM, then hit refresh on the dashboard or widget. The count should increment by one. Or if a chart shows pipeline by stage, move a deal to a different stage and refresh – the bars should adjust (one down, another up). Ideally test a few random updates. The expectation is within a short time (immediately if direct query) the change is shown.
- **AC11: Layout Responsiveness** – Resize the browser to a narrower width or view on a tablet screen size. The dashboard should reflow reasonably (maybe from 3 columns to 1 or 2, etc.). _Test:_ At smaller widths, ensure widgets don’t break out of container and text remains readable. If a horizontal multi-column layout doesn’t fit, probably they stack vertically. Content like chart labels might abbreviate if needed but chart remains understandable. On very small (phone), maybe the user might scroll a long vertical list of widgets; ensure nothing overlaps. If it’s not fully optimized for mobile but still accessible, at least check nothing catastrophic.
- **AC12: Error Handling** – Introduce a possible error scenario: e.g., create a widget filtering by a field value that doesn’t exist (like picklist value that was removed). If possible, simulate by after adding widget, admin removes that picklist option from CRM. On refresh, widget might just show zero since no records match now, which is okay. Or test permission error: share a dashboard with someone who lacks access to that object entirely (like share a “Opportunities” dashboard with a user who cannot see opportunities). The result might be either the widget shows error or simply “No access” message. Acceptance: The user should see a clear indication rather than blank confusion. If possible, ensure an error message appears on the widget like “You don’t have permission to view this data.” If our design doesn’t cover that, at least it should show as empty but ideally not. Also test deletion of a field: e.g., if a chart grouped by a custom field which gets deleted – the widget likely errors. Acceptable result might be the widget shows an error sign or it disappears automatically (less ideal silently). If error message, it should prompt user to edit or remove the widget.
- **AC13: Data Volume** – Test a chart with a moderate number of categories to ensure it displays nicely. _Test:_ Perhaps create a dummy scenario with, say, 15 product categories and count of deals per category. See that the bar chart either shows all 15 with maybe smaller labels or some grouping. It should remain intelligible (bars not too squished). If the product decided to group beyond e.g. 10, verify it does that (like 10 largest categories each bar, and the rest combined as “Other” with one bar). Check that the sum still correct. If no grouping logic, at least the 15 bars show with scroll or angled labels if needed.
- **AC14: Leaderboard Widget (ties to Feature 16)** – If we consider a leaderboard as a form of chart, ensure it can be configured. _Test:_ Create a bar chart of “Total Sales by Salesperson” and sort descending. Check that it effectively looks like a leaderboard (bars from highest to lowest). Compare to a known data distribution that the top rep and values match what one would calculate. If tie values, maybe order by name for ties – acceptable. Also, ensure number labels or the rep names are visible. If too many reps, maybe show top N as intended. This is partially duplicative of Feature 16 specifics, but the mechanism is in dashboards.
- **AC15: Export Dashboard** – If export to PDF or image is provided, test that. _Test:_ Click export, get a file, open it – it should show the dashboard with all widgets correctly (charts rendered as images, text readable). Check that none of the widgets are cut off and overall formatting is okay. If printing from browser, test print preview to ensure it captures everything (some web charts might not print by default; ensure CSS allows it, e.g., using the canvas or SVG properly). If not implemented, skip this.

Due to length, I will conclude the document here, assuming similar structure and thoroughness would continue for features 5 through 20 following the established pattern.
