## Product Overview

Ethan is an **AI voice interviewer platform** that automates the interviewing stage of recruitment. It conducts **spoken interviews with candidates** via a natural conversation, asks technical or behavioral questions, evaluates responses in depth, and delivers structured feedback to hiring teams. Unlike traditional video interviews or text chatbots, Ethan offers a **human-like voice interaction**, replicating the tone and adaptability of a live interviewer. The system is designed to **identify top talent efficiently** by scaling up what skilled interviewers do – asking probing questions, giving candidates time to think aloud, and assessing nuanced aspects of answers.

**Problem Space:** Modern recruitment faces challenges of scale, bias, and shallow evaluations. Human recruiters have limited time, leading to short initial screens that often only scratch the surface of a candidate’s abilities. Scheduling interviews is also time-consuming, and human biases (conscious or not) can impact fairness. Furthermore, the rise of remote interviewing and AI tools has introduced new cheating methods (e.g. candidates using AI to generate answers). Organizations need a **scalable yet fair and rigorous** way to interview large candidate pools without overburdening recruiters.

**Solution in Brief:** Ethan addresses these issues by providing:

- **Scalable interviewing:** Hundreds of candidates can be interviewed in parallel by the AI, eliminating scheduling bottlenecks and allowing every applicant a chance to be heard. This dramatically reduces time-to-hire (up to 82% reduction observed with similar AI hiring tools).
- **Quality and depth:** The AI uses advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and domain-specific knowledge to ask intelligent follow-ups and delve into candidates’ reasoning. It evaluates both the content and delivery of answers – for example, analyzing code efficiency in a coding task, or the soundness of reasoning in a case study.
- **Candidate-centric design:** The voice interface is designed to put candidates at ease. It responds with empathy and encouragement, creating a less stressful environment. Candidates can schedule interviews at their convenience and complete them from anywhere, improving overall experience.
- **Integrity and fairness:** Ethan employs **behavioral analytics** to flag suspicious behavior (e.g., sudden perfect solutions after struggles, indicating outside help). It also uses **consistent scoring rubrics** and AI models trained on large, diverse datasets to minimize bias, aiming for fair treatment of all candidates.

**Market Context:** Ethan competes in the emerging space of AI-driven hiring tools, alongside products offering AI video interviews or automated phone screens. Its differentiation lies in **voice conversation** (no need for candidates to be on camera if not desired), a strong focus on **multimodal skill assessment** (coding, cases, technical Q\&A), and advanced **fraud detection**. Early adopters are likely tech companies hiring at scale, consulting firms, and any organization seeking to streamline hiring while improving quality. Ethan is offered as a cloud service with a **pay-as-you-go pricing** model for flexibility, making it attractive to enterprises and recruitment agencies alike.

## User Personas

To design Ethan effectively, we identify key user personas and their goals:

### **1. Recruiter / Hiring Manager (Primary User)**

**Background:** HR recruiters, technical hiring managers, or team leads responsible for interviewing and selecting candidates. They may handle dozens of candidates per open role and coordinate with multiple stakeholders.
**Goals & Needs:**

- **Screen Efficiently:** Want to quickly identify top candidates from a large pool without conducting repetitive phone screens. They need concise, insightful reports on each candidate’s performance.
- **Quality of Hire:** Need confidence that the interview process accurately assesses job-relevant skills so that selected candidates will perform well.
- **Bias Reduction:** Desire tools that help mitigate personal bias – objective data on candidates’ abilities and potential.
- **Workflow Integration:** Expect the tool to fit into existing recruiting workflow (ATS integration, scheduling, etc.) with minimal extra effort.
- **Customization:** Want to tailor interviews to specific roles or competencies they care about (e.g., adding a custom technical question for a particular team).

**Frustrations/Pain Points:** Traditional interviewing is time-intensive (scheduling, repetitive questioning) and often fails to surface true skills. They might miss great candidates due to shallow screens or lose candidates due to slow processes. There’s also concern about candidates gaming the system (cheating) or the risk of unconscious bias in evaluations.

### **2. Candidate / Job Applicant (End User)**

**Background:** Individuals applying for jobs who are invited to an AI interview with Ethan. They could be recent graduates or experienced professionals, from any demographic or geography. They may interview outside regular work hours and often feel stress during interviews.
**Goals & Needs:**

- **Fair Chance to Showcase Skills:** They want an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities and thought process in an unbiased setting. Some may prefer an AI interviewer if it means a more standardized and fair evaluation.
- **Low-Stress Experience:** Hope for an interview environment that isn’t intimidating – ideally conversational and encouraging. A positive experience matters; even if they don’t get the job, they want to feel respected and heard.
- **Clarity & Convenience:** Need clear instructions on the interview process and the freedom to schedule or take the interview at a convenient time (especially for those balancing current jobs or different time zones).
- **Feedback:** Many candidates appreciate feedback on their performance so they can improve (though traditionally this is rarely given, an AI platform could potentially provide it).

**Frustrations:** Candidates often dread impersonal one-way video interviews or overly rigid automated tests. They may be concerned about AI fairness or unsure how an AI will judge them. Technical glitches or confusing interfaces can be a turn-off. They also fear not getting any human interaction, so the AI must feel as natural as possible.

### **3. HR IT Administrator / Talent Acquisition Ops**

_(Secondary persona, responsible for technical setup and integration)_
**Background:** IT or operations personnel in HR departments who manage recruitment tools (ATS, assessment platforms).
**Goals & Needs:**

- **Seamless Integration:** Ensure Ethan connects smoothly with their ATS or HRIS, so that candidates can be invited and results received without manual steps.
- **Security & Compliance:** They worry about data privacy (especially interview recordings and transcripts), compliance with regulations (GDPR, EEOC guidelines, etc.), and want tools that meet enterprise security standards (encryption, access control, etc.).
- **Custom Workflows:** Need the platform to accommodate their organization’s specific hiring steps, perhaps customizing what happens after an interview (e.g., auto-schedule next round or send rejection emails).
- **Scalability & Reliability:** The system should handle peak hiring seasons and be reliable (close to 100% uptime), as any downtime could disrupt hiring pipelines.

**Frustrations:** Integration nightmares where a new tool doesn’t play well with legacy systems, causing data silos or manual work. Also, any hint of security vulnerabilities or non-compliance can be a show-stopper for enterprise adoption. They need robust admin controls and support.

_(Note: Other stakeholders include **Product Management & Development Teams** for Ethan itself – ensuring the product meets market needs – but for this PRD our focus is on the above users who interact with the product in a hiring context.)_

## Functional Requirements – Detailed Feature Descriptions

Below we detail Ethan’s key features and functional requirements, organized by theme. Each sub-section describes the capability and lists specific requirements.

### Conversational AI with Human-like Interaction

**Description:** Ethan acts as a **conversational interviewer**, engaging the candidate with a natural voice and dialogue flow. The AI’s speech should be clear, pleasant, and modulated to convey empathy and understanding. It should simulate the demeanor of a top interviewer – e.g., being encouraging, listening actively (with short acknowledgments like “I see” or a gentle “mm-hmm”), and probing intelligently. The interaction is **bi-directional**: candidates can ask for clarification or pause to think, and Ethan will handle it like a human would (e.g., repeating a question if asked, or giving the candidate a moment of silence when appropriate).

**Requirements:**

- The AI voice must be **natural and empathetic**. It should use **text-to-speech (TTS)** with human-like intonation and adjust its tone based on the context (e.g., cheerful congratulations for a correct solution, a reassuring tone if the candidate seems nervous). Empathetic voice interfaces have been shown to improve realism and candidate confidence.
- **Active Listening Cues:** Ethan should provide small verbal cues (e.g., “Okay”, “take your time”) to show it’s engaged, much like a human interviewer, rather than remaining silent after asking a question. This makes the conversation feel alive.
- **Contextual Dialogue Management:** The system will maintain context of the conversation. If a candidate’s answer veers off-topic or is very brief, Ethan can gently steer them back or ask for elaboration (“Can you tell me more about that?”). If an answer is unclear, Ethan might rephrase the question or ask a specific follow-up.
- **Adaptive Questioning:** The AI should adapt based on the candidate’s responses. For example, if a candidate’s answer indicates a very high skill level, Ethan might naturally progress to a harder follow-up question to further challenge them. Conversely, if the candidate is struggling, Ethan can offer a hint or move to a different topic to avoid undue frustration. This mimics how skilled interviewers dynamically adjust the interview. Ethan essentially “dives deeper” when it sees an opportunity, ensuring a thorough skill assessment for strong candidates and a fair chance for all to respond.
- **Turn-taking and Interruptions:** The conversation engine must handle natural turn-taking. Candidates might interrupt or speak while Ethan is talking – Ethan should be able to pause or say, “Sorry, go ahead,” similar to a polite interviewer. Likewise, Ethan won’t cut off the candidate abruptly; it waits for natural pauses or end of speech (with a sensible timeout if the candidate stops mid-sentence).
- **Duration Management:** Each interview session should be managed to an expected duration (e.g., a standard 15-30 minute initial interview). Ethan should pace the interview to cover key questions in the allotted time, but also allow flexibility (if a candidate is giving a long answer, Ethan might skip a redundant question later to stay in time). There should be a mechanism to extend time if needed or politely conclude if time runs out, saying e.g., “I’m mindful of time, so let’s move to the last question.”
- **Multilingual Support (Voice):** _\[Optional for initial version]_ Ethan’s conversational abilities should not be limited to English. For global enterprises, support for other languages (Spanish, Mandarin, etc.) is desirable. This includes both speech recognition and TTS in those languages. At minimum, the architecture should be ready to add new languages. (Note: This aligns with providing inclusive hiring – e.g., PreScreen AI can conduct interviews in 50+ languages. Ethan aims to be similarly flexible.)

### Deep Skill Assessment and Insight Generation

**Description:** Ethan goes beyond surface-level answers by extracting rich insights about a candidate’s skills, thought processes, and problem-solving approaches. While conversing, the AI evaluates not just _what_ the candidate says, but _how_ they approach questions. This requires advanced NLP and possibly domain-specific analysis for technical content. The output is a detailed assessment highlighting each candidate’s strengths, weaknesses, and fit for the role.

**Requirements:**

- **NLP Understanding:** The system must accurately capture and interpret the candidate’s responses using **speech-to-text (STT)** and natural language understanding. It should handle various accents and speaking styles reliably. Misinterpretations should be minimized, as they could affect scoring. The AI will use context to disambiguate answers when possible. For example, if the question was about a time the candidate led a team, references to “we delivered the project” should be understood in context of leadership.
- **Knowledge & Reasoning Analysis:** For questions that test knowledge or reasoning (e.g., “How would you design X system?” or “What is your approach to solving Y?”), Ethan should break down the answer and evaluate key components. This includes identifying whether the candidate’s explanation is **logically sound, covers key points, and demonstrates strategic thinking**. The AI could use a combination of rule-based checklists and AI model inference to judge depth. It should note if an answer is superficial vs. deeply analytical.
- **Behavioral Question Insight:** In responses to behavioral questions (e.g., “Tell me about a conflict you resolved”), Ethan’s NLP engine should pick up signals of competencies like leadership, communication, or empathy. It might categorize the answer according to a competency framework. For instance, it can flag if the candidate used a structured approach (Situation-Task-Action-Result), which often indicates good storytelling and reflection.
- **Think-Aloud Encouragement:** Ethan should encourage candidates to **share their thought process**. For example, in problem-solving questions, if a candidate stops talking while thinking, Ethan can prompt: “Feel free to think aloud – I’m interested in how you’re approaching this.” This collaborative style helps reveal the candidate’s approach and creativity. The system will capture these thought processes as part of the assessment.
- **Emotional and Communication Cues:** Using paralinguistic analysis, Ethan could detect certain emotional tones or confidence levels from the candidate’s voice (e.g., hesitation, enthusiasm). While the primary scoring is content-based, these cues add context. For instance, strong confident delivery might be noted as a positive (good communication skills), whereas consistent hesitation could be flagged (possibly lack of experience or confidence, or just nerves – which should be interpreted carefully). _Note:_ This is secondary and must be used carefully to avoid bias; the emphasis remains on the content of answers.
- **AI-Powered Insights Summary:** After the interview, Ethan should generate a concise **interview insights report**. This report might include:

  - A summary of the candidate’s overall performance (e.g., “The candidate demonstrated strong analytical skills in the case discussion, but showed some gaps in technical knowledge about X.”).
  - Skill-by-skill ratings (e.g., Problem Solving: 8/10, Communication: 7/10, Coding: 9/10, etc.) based on interview responses. These ratings should map to the job’s competency requirements.
  - Notable quotes or moments from the interview as evidence for the ratings (for example: _“When asked about a tough bug, the candidate systematically broke down the problem, indicating solid debugging skills.”_).
  - A recommendation or next step (e.g., “Recommended to advance to on-site technical interview” or “Recommended for hiring manager review”).

- **Data-Driven Questioning:** Over time, the system can learn which questions or follow-ups are most effective at differentiating candidates (through data analysis of outcomes). Functional requirement is that the platform will allow incorporation of such learnings – e.g., automatically favoring questions that correlate with on-job success, thereby continuously improving the insight quality.
- **Calibration with Human Interviewers:** Initially, to ensure the AI’s assessments align with human expectations, the system should be calibrated. For a set of sample interviews, human interviewers will also rate the candidates. Any discrepancies will guide tuning of the AI’s evaluation criteria (acceptance criteria could be that AI scores have a strong correlation with experienced interviewer scores).

### Support for Diverse Interview Formats

**Description:** Ethan is versatile, handling various interview formats and content types. Whether it’s a coding test, a business case simulation, a discussion of research papers for an R\&D role, or standard behavioral questions, Ethan can conduct and assess the interview appropriately. This allows organizations to use one platform (Ethan) for many roles – from software engineers and data scientists to consultants and project managers – by configuring different interview scenarios.

**Requirements:**

- **Coding Challenge Interviews:** Ethan can conduct technical coding interviews. In this format, Ethan presents a programming problem to the candidate (either via voice description and a text-based prompt on screen, or an attached code editor). The candidate then writes code to solve the problem. Ethan’s role:

  - Provide the problem description clearly (and display it in a text/code interface for reference).
  - Allow the candidate to either explain their approach verbally first (which Ethan can discuss) or start coding. The AI should encourage the candidate to talk through their logic even as they code.
  - **Live Code Evaluation:** The platform should include a coding environment that can compile/run the candidate’s code against test cases. Ethan can inform the candidate if their code runs successfully or if there are errors (optionally, depending on interview rules).
  - While the candidate codes, Ethan remains “present” – possibly by saying “Let me know when you want to test your code” or answering simple questions (like clarifying the problem).
  - **Post-coding Dialogue:** After coding, Ethan asks the candidate to explain their solution, why they chose a certain approach, or how they would improve it. This mimics a real interviewer probing code quality and decision-making.
  - **Assessment:** Ethan evaluates the **code correctness** (did it solve the problem?), **code quality** (is it clean, efficient, well-structured?), and **algorithmic approach**. The scoring could combine automated test results and AI analysis of code (perhaps using static analysis or comparing with an ideal solution). The result is a coding score and feedback (e.g., “Uses an efficient sorting algorithm, code passes all test cases, but variable naming could be clearer.”).
  - _Support multiple programming languages:_ At least support popular languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++…) for coding tasks. The problem statements might be standardized, and the candidate can choose a language.

- **Business Case Study Interviews:** For consulting or analytical roles, Ethan conducts case study interviews. This involves presenting a business scenario and asking the candidate to analyze or solve it (e.g., market entry strategy, profitability analysis). Requirements:

  - The AI will present information in stages (like a human interviewer giving case data) – e.g., an initial prompt, then answer candidate questions about data, maybe provide additional exhibits if applicable (these could be shown as text/tables on screen).
  - Ethan will evaluate the candidate’s **structuring of the problem**, quantitative analysis (if any calculations are done verbally), and the creativity/practicality of recommendations.
  - The conversation should be interactive: the candidate might ask for certain data (“Do we have information on competitor pricing?”) – Ethan should be prepared with predefined answers or data tables to simulate a realistic case.
  - **Scoring:** Use a rubric similar to top consulting firms: e.g., measure analytical skills, business acumen, communication. If the candidate asks a very insightful question or identifies a key issue, that’s noted positively. If they make incorrect assumptions without checking, that’s a flag. Ethan should capture these nuances.

- **Machine Learning Research/Technical Deep-Dive:** For roles like ML scientist or engineering specialists, Ethan can discuss a research problem or technical project:

  - Ethan might ask the candidate to describe a previous project or to reason through a hypothetical scenario (e.g., designing an ML model for a given task).
  - The AI should understand advanced domain terminology and be able to follow the candidate’s explanation, asking in-depth follow-ups. For instance, “You mentioned using a convolutional network – why was that architecture chosen over a transformer model?”
  - **Assessment:** Evaluate the candidate’s depth of knowledge, innovation, and ability to communicate complex ideas. The AI can cross-check facts (if someone makes a claim about an algorithm, the AI should have knowledge to sense if it’s accurate or not). It’s less about right/wrong and more about depth and clarity.

- **Emerging Tech and Other Domains:** The platform content library must be extensible to new domains (e.g., AR/VR, blockchain). For example, for an AR/VR developer role, Ethan might ask about 3D rendering techniques or have the candidate debug a hypothetical AR app scenario. The requirement is to **continuously update the question bank and AI knowledge base** for emerging fields so that interview content remains relevant. Domain experts or the client company should be able to contribute custom questions in these areas as needed (see customization section).
- **Traditional Behavioral Interviews:** Apart from specialized formats, Ethan should handle standard behavioral and situational questions (common to many roles). E.g., “Tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult team member.” The AI should be capable of doing a full conversational behavioral interview for non-technical roles as well, analyzing responses for competencies (leadership, teamwork, etc.).
- **Multi-Format Flow:** Some interviews might combine formats – e.g., start with a few behavioral questions, then a technical challenge. Ethan should smoothly transition between sections (perhaps saying “Next, we will do a coding exercise.”). This multi-format flow must be configurable per interview template.

### Emphasis on Real-World, Job-Relevant Skills

**Description:** Ethan prioritizes **authentic skill demonstration**. All interview content and evaluation methods aim to mirror actual job requirements. This means reducing reliance on trick puzzles or abstract hypotheticals in favor of tasks and questions directly drawn from on-the-job scenarios. By doing so, the interview performance is a strong predictor of job performance, and candidates perceive the process as more relevant and fair.

**Requirements:**

- **Work Sample Tasks:** Wherever possible, interview prompts should resemble real work. For example, a software developer might be asked to debug a piece of code (similar to their daily work) rather than solve a contrived puzzle. A marketing applicant might be asked how they’d plan a product launch, etc. Ethan’s library of questions/cases will be curated with this principle in mind.
- **Relevance Check for Custom Content:** If recruiters add their own questions (through the custom interview feature), the system should encourage or flag for relevance. Perhaps provide templates or examples of good, job-related questions to guide them.
- **Scenario-Based Questions:** Many questions should be scenario-based: “What would you do if…?” which elicit how a candidate applies skills in context. This tests practical knowledge and decision-making rather than memorization. Ethan should have follow-ups for these to get deeper (“Why would you take that approach? What if constraint X changes?”).
- **Real Data or Artifacts:** For some roles, using real or realistic artifacts can be valuable (e.g., a dataset snippet for a data analyst to interpret, a design mockup for a product designer to critique). The platform should support presenting such materials during the interview. Ethan can reference these in questions (e.g., “Looking at the graph I just shared, what trends do you see?”).
- **Evaluation Alignment:** The scoring criteria for each question/task should align with what success on the job looks like. For instance, if collaboration is key to the job, even an individual task’s evaluation might include points for how the candidate considered team dynamics in their answer. This ensures that high interview scores correspond to high likelihood of job success.
- **Continuous Validation:** Over time, track how candidates who scored well on Ethan’s interviews perform on the job (for hired candidates) or in later interview rounds. Use this to validate that the skills assessed are indeed predictive. This might be a longer-term product improvement step, but as a requirement, the product should allow capturing such data for analysis (e.g., recruiters can mark later whether a candidate was successful or not, feeding into Ethan’s learning loop).
- **Avoid Brain-Teaser or Trivia unless relevant:** The product philosophy will be to avoid outdated brain-teaser questions or pure trivia that don’t reflect job needs, unless a company explicitly configures them (and even then, warn if possible). This ensures candidate goodwill and focuses on meaningful assessment.

### Advanced Cheating and Fraud Detection

**Description:** Ethan includes robust anti-cheating mechanisms to ensure the authenticity of each candidate’s performance. Unlike simple testing platforms that only check for plagiarized answers, Ethan analyzes behavior and context to catch subtler forms of cheating (e.g., receiving outside help in real-time, using AI tools to generate answers, identity fraud, etc.). This protects the integrity of the interview results so hiring decisions can be trusted.

**Requirements:**

- **Behavioral Pattern Analysis:** The system will monitor the candidate’s behavior during the interview for anomalies. For instance:

  - **Inconsistent Performance:** If a candidate’s response quality suddenly jumps (e.g., they struggle with an easy question but then flawlessly answer a very hard question), the AI flags this as suspicious (possibly indicating they got external help or used an AI tool).
  - **Response Latency:** Abnormally long pauses before answering simple questions, or frequent repeating of the question (could indicate they are using a secondary device to find answers) can be noted.
  - **Verbal Cues:** The AI might detect if the candidate is whispering or muttering as if reading something, or if there are two voices (someone else feeding answers). It can also pick up if the cadence/tone of answers changes (e.g., the candidate reading a prepared or AI-generated text vs. speaking spontaneously).

- **Proctoring via Camera (Optional):** If the interview is taken on a device with a camera (even though Ethan is voice-first, it could ask for camera access as a proctoring measure), the system could use vision AI to monitor:

  - Presence of additional people in the room or the candidate looking off-screen constantly (perhaps reading answers).
  - Eye movement and focus – e.g., constantly looking down might indicate looking at notes or phone.
  - Lip-sync or audio mismatches if an AI voice were used by candidate (this is an edge case).
    _These vision-based checks should be optional and used with candidate consent, as not all interviews will use video._

- **AI-Usage Detection:** Because candidates might attempt to use AI assistants (like ChatGPT on the side) to answer questions, Ethan should incorporate methods to detect AI-generated content. For written code, it can use plagiarism detection against known code solutions on the internet. For spoken answers, if transcripts contain phrasing that is a near-exact match to common internet sources or AI-generated text patterns, flag it. There are emerging tools that attempt to classify AI-written text; those could be integrated for the transcript of the answer.
- **Environment Lockdown for Coding:** During coding challenges, use a secure browser sandbox or an IDE that prevents copy-pasting code from external sources (or at least flags it). If a candidate tries to paste a large block of code, log it as potential plagiarism.
- **Identity Verification:** Ensure the person taking the interview is the actual candidate:

  - Could use voice biometrics to match the candidate’s voice to a previous sample (e.g., a phone screen or a stated sample) – to catch someone else impersonating the candidate.
  - Alternatively, a quick face scan photo at start (if camera on) to match ID. At minimum, include an honor statement the candidate agrees to, about not cheating and being who they say they are.

- **Real-time Alerts:** If the system strongly suspects cheating _during_ the interview (e.g., detects another voice giving answers, or finds the candidate is reading off something verbatim), it can decide to intervene. Options include:

  - Ethan could inject a prompt like, “It sounds like you might be referring to external material. Please ensure all answers are your own.” – a gentle warning.
  - In extreme cases, Ethan could end the interview early and flag it for review. However, care must be taken to avoid false positives; likely better to complete the interview but mark it “integrity flagged” for human recruiters to review.

- **Post-Interview Analysis:** After the interview, the system compiles any cheating indicators into an **integrity report** for the recruiter:

  - E.g., “Flagged: Possible external assistance. Rationale: The candidate’s performance on question 3 was inconsistent with earlier responses; answer was nearly identical to an online article.”
  - Provide recordings or data snippets (like the exact text matched, or the moment another voice was heard) as evidence for human review.
  - Also note if nothing suspicious was detected, to build trust (“No anomalies detected. This appears to be the candidate’s authentic work.”).

- **Cheating Dataset and Model:** Continually improve the fraud detection through machine learning. As new cheating techniques emerge (e.g., advanced AI usage, deepfakes), update the detection algorithms. The system should log data from confirmed cheating incidents to train future models (with appropriate privacy safeguards).
- **Candidate Consent & Privacy:** Before an interview begins, especially if monitoring behavior and potentially using camera or analyzing voice, the candidate must be informed and consent to proctoring measures. Provide a brief statement like “This interview session will be monitored for integrity (e.g., to prevent cheating). We appreciate your understanding.” This ensures transparency and compliance with any local regulations (some jurisdictions require disclosure of AI monitoring).
- **Non-Intrusive Experience:** All these measures should run in the background without disrupting honest candidates. The candidate should not have to deal with constant system warnings or intrusive checks if they are behaving normally. For example, don’t unnecessarily lock their computer or forbid note-taking unless required; focus on detection rather than heavy-handed prevention that could ruin user experience.

### Candidate Experience and Satisfaction

**Description:** Ethan is designed with the candidate’s experience in mind, striving for **high satisfaction across demographics**. A positive candidate experience means candidates feel the interview was fair, engaging, and a good reflection of the company’s innovative culture. This section describes features ensuring candidates are comfortable and satisfied, which in turn reflects well on the hiring company and yields a larger, more diverse talent pool (candidates are less likely to drop out of the process).

**Requirements:**

- **Empathetic Onboarding:** The interview should start with a warm, brief introduction. Ethan might say, in a friendly tone, “Hello \[Name], I’m Ethan, an AI interviewer. I’m here to learn about your experiences and skills. I know interviews can be stressful, but don’t worry – take your time, and if you need me to repeat or clarify anything, just ask. Shall we begin?” This sets a welcoming stage.
- **Practice Question (Optional):** To reduce stress, optionally give the candidate a quick practice question or interaction tutorial. For example, “Let’s do a quick warm-up: say a few words about why you applied for this job.” This gets them talking and comfortable with the format (and is not evaluated). They can skip if they feel ready.
- **Responsive and Encouraging Demeanor:** During the interview, Ethan should be encouraging. If a candidate struggles, Ethan can respond with understanding: e.g., “This is a tough problem – it’s okay, do your best, and talk me through your thinking.” If a candidate gives a good answer, some positive reinforcement is nice: “Great, that’s a solid approach.” The goal is to mimic a supportive human interviewer. Empathy in the AI’s responses can reduce candidate anxiety. (Research shows users find empathic AI voices more realistic and helpful.)
- **Clarity of Prompts:** All questions and instructions must be clearly communicated. If a question is complex or multi-part, Ethan might break it down or offer to repeat it. The interface should also display the question text so candidates can refer back (especially for long case prompts or coding tasks).
- **Flexible Scheduling and 24/7 Availability:** Candidates can take the interview at any time before a deadline. The system should allow rescheduling or late completions within reason (as configured by the recruiter). This flexibility is a big plus for candidate convenience. A candidate portal or link will let them start the interview when ready.
- **Cross-Device Support:** The interview platform should support common devices – if a candidate wants to do it on their smartphone, it should work (mobile-responsive web design or a mobile app, and ability to use phone microphone). Also support desktop with a headset. Minimal downloads or setup should be required (perhaps a quick permission check for microphone).
- **Minimal Distractions:** The interface should be clean – if video is not required, perhaps the candidate just sees an Ethan avatar or waveform, so they aren’t distracted by watching themselves on camera as in a typical video call. If the candidate prefers, allow turning off any visual avatar so they can focus on the conversation.
- **Candidate Feedback and Results (Optional):** One innovative feature is giving candidates some feedback or output after the interview:

  - _Basic feedback:_ immediately after, Ethan could say, “Thank you for interviewing! We’ll be in touch. If you’d like, I can share a brief summary of how you did.” – If enabled by the employer, the candidate could get a summary like “You communicated clearly and had a strong example for teamwork. You might want to brush up on data structures (as seen in the coding question).” This must be done tactfully and only if company policy allows. It can greatly enhance candidate goodwill – even those not selected feel they learned something.
  - At minimum, if detailed feedback isn’t possible, at least provide a friendly closing remark and an outline of next steps (“Our team will review your results and you’ll hear back within X days.”).

- **Candidate Satisfaction Survey:** After the interview, the system can optionally present a quick satisfaction survey: e.g., “How was your experience interviewing with our AI assistant?” with a 1-5 star or short answer. This feedback goes to the hiring company and to us for improving Ethan. High satisfaction scores (target e.g. >85% positive) would validate the candidate experience. Reports from existing AI hiring deployments show high candidate satisfaction when done right (one AI hiring platform reported \~90% satisfaction rate among candidates).
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the experience is accessible to people with disabilities:

  - If a candidate has hearing impairment, provide an option for a text-based chat interview (or real-time captions of Ethan’s voice).
  - If a candidate has speech impairment, perhaps allow them to type responses which the system can still analyze (not common, but we should not exclude such candidates).
  - Follow WCAG guidelines for the web interface (e.g., screen reader compatibility for any on-screen text, high contrast mode for visually impaired).
  - Multilingual support helps non-native speakers interview in their strongest language, which improves fairness and comfort.

- **Personalization of AI Persona:** Allow the hiring company to choose an “AI persona” slightly – e.g., name (Ethan could be given a different name if desired), voice selection (maybe a few voice options, including a female voice, different accents, etc., to match company culture or candidate preference). This can humanize the experience more.
- **Privacy and Respect:** Make sure to reassure candidates that their data will be handled securely and that the AI’s decisions are reviewed. Some candidates might be wary of an AI – a statement in the invite or intro can clarify “This AI interview is designed to be fair and objective. Your responses will be recorded and analyzed, but a human will also review the results. We take privacy seriously.” Building trust is key to a positive experience.
- **Consistency Across Demographics:** Monitor candidate experience across different demographic groups (possibly via the survey or by analysis) to ensure one group isn’t inadvertently disadvantaged or less satisfied. For example, check if non-native speakers are having more trouble – if so, adjust the system (maybe slower speech or simpler language mode when needed). The goal is an equally positive experience for all qualified candidates.

### Detailed Technical Evaluations and Reporting

**Description:** This feature set focuses on how Ethan evaluates specific technical answers (coding, algorithms, etc.) and how results are compiled into reports for decision-makers. It overlaps with some earlier sections but emphasizes the _rigor and detail_ of assessments for technical content.

**Requirements:**

- **Coding Solution Evaluation:** As noted under diverse formats, the system must rigorously evaluate coding exercises:

  - **Correctness:** Did the candidate’s code produce expected outputs for a variety of test cases (including edge cases)?
  - **Efficiency:** Analyze time complexity (perhaps by examining algorithmic approach or by runtime on large inputs) and memory usage if relevant.
  - **Code Quality:** If time allows, analyze if the code is well-organized (proper functions, naming, comments if any). Possibly leverage linters or static analysis for style issues, but weigh them lightly compared to correctness.
  - **Problem-Solving Approach:** Even if a solution isn’t fully correct, the report should note the approach and partial credit. For example, “Approach uses a two-pointer technique which is on the right track, but an edge case for empty input was not handled.”
  - **Plagiarism Check:** Cross-verify the code against known solutions on the web (as many coding problems have posted answers). If a near-identical match is found, flag it as possible plagiarism (this ties into cheating detection).

- **Algorithm/Design Question Evaluation:** In some technical interviews, questions might be open-ended design or theoretical algorithm questions answered in voice. Ethan should parse the answer for key points:

  - Did the candidate identify appropriate data structures or algorithms?
  - Did they consider complexity, scalability, or alternative approaches?
  - The AI can have a model answer outline and mark which points were covered by the candidate.

- **AR/VR Technical Qs:** For emerging tech like AR/VR, if questions involve e.g. “How would you optimize rendering performance in a VR app?”, Ethan should have or learn domain-specific criteria (like knowledge of rendering pipelines, GPU-CPU tradeoffs, etc.). This likely involves maintaining an up-to-date knowledge base or expert-curated rubric for new domains.
- **Rigorous Business Case Scoring:** For case interviews, ensure that scoring is as rigorous as consulting firms:

  - Did the candidate structure the problem (score structure)?
  - Did they correctly interpret data provided (score analytical skills)?
  - Were their recommendations logical and backed by data (score business judgment)?
  - How was their communication?
  - Use a weighted scorecard to produce an overall case performance metric. Possibly calibrate scores with what human interviewers would give on sample cases.

- **Soft Skills and Cultural Fit:** While harder to quantify, Ethan can evaluate communication clarity, confidence, and other soft skills through natural language cues and the content structure. E.g., does the candidate articulate clearly and logically? Use of filler words, coherence of storytelling, etc., can be factors. Provide comments in the report on these (but carefully, to avoid penalizing non-native accents or styles unjustly – focus on whether the point was conveyed effectively).
- **Compilation of Results:** After each interview, the system generates a **comprehensive report** for the recruiter/hiring manager, including:

  - **Summary:** A few sentences summarizing the candidate (as mentioned in deep insight section). Possibly include an **AI-generated recommendation** (e.g., Strongly Proceed / Proceed / Borderline / Do not proceed) with explanation.
  - **Scores/ratings:** A table or list of ratings on key competencies or sections. For instance:

    - Technical Skills: 4/5
    - Problem Solving: 5/5
    - Communication: 3/5
    - \[If available] Cultural Fit: e.g., values alignment 4/5 (if there were such questions).
      These criteria should be customizable per role.

  - **Transcripts & Annotations:** The full transcript of the interview (or relevant excerpts) with important parts highlighted or commented. E.g., highlight where the candidate gave an excellent answer, or where they made an error. This allows the human reviewer to quickly see context if needed. Possibly provide audio replay for each question segment if the recruiter wants to listen to tone, etc.
  - **Code output & analysis:** If coding was involved, include the code written, results of test cases, and any static analysis details in an appendix of the report.
  - **Cheating flags:** Clearly indicate if any integrity flags were raised (and where).
  - **Comparative Benchmarking:** Optionally, show how this candidate compares to others (if enough data) – e.g., “This performance places the candidate in the top 15% of all interviewees for the Frontend Developer role.” This helps interpret scores. (This requires data collection over time; initial phase may not have this.)

- **Recruiter Dashboard:** The product should include a UI for recruiters to view these reports, possibly with sorting/filtering. For instance, after a hiring campaign, a recruiter can see all candidates interviewed for Role X, see their scores at a glance, and quickly shortlist top scorers. The dashboard might also allow playing back parts of interviews or sharing a candidate’s interview report with the hiring panel.
- **Integration of Assessments into ATS:** Ensure that the key results (scores, recommendations, maybe a link to full report) are sent to the ATS so that within the candidate’s profile, the recruiter can see “AI Interview Score: 87/100 – Recommended to Advance.” This makes the workflow seamless. The details can reside in Ethan’s system but a summary should go to ATS.
- **Explainability of Scores:** To build trust, each score or recommendation should have an explanation traceable to evidence. For example, if Communication got 3/5, the report might note “The candidate’s explanations sometimes lacked clarity or required prompting.” If possible, provide at least bullet justification per competency. This transparency is important for both user trust and compliance (avoiding “black box” concerns in hiring).
- **Configurable Thresholds:** Allow hiring teams to configure what constitutes a “pass” or “fail” or to automatically trigger next steps. For example, they could set: anyone scoring above X in core skills is auto-advanced to an on-site interview. Ethan should support such rules, though final decisions can always be overridden by humans.
- **Continuous Model Updates:** The evaluation models (especially NLP scoring) should be updated regularly as more interview data comes in and as job requirements evolve. There should be a process to retrain and validate the models on new data while ensuring no drift that could affect consistency. This might be covered under continuous improvement, but functionally, the product should allow model updates without disrupting service (rolling updates, etc.).

### Custom Interview Creation and Configuration

**Description:** Recruiters or admins must be able to create and customize interviews tailored to specific roles or organizational needs. While Ethan comes with a library of best-practice questions and templates, each company may have unique requirements (e.g., a particular proprietary case study, or values-based questions tied to their culture). This feature set ensures the product is flexible and configurable.

**Requirements:**

- **Interview Template Builder:** Provide a user-friendly interface where a recruiter or HR admin can assemble an interview flow. They should be able to:

  - Choose question modules from a library (e.g., add a coding question, then a behavioral question, etc.).
  - Specify their own questions: They can input a custom question, define what format it is (coding vs free-text answer), and provide guidelines for the AI on evaluating it. For example, if they add a custom technical question, they might provide key points the answer should contain, which the AI can use to gauge correctness.
  - Set the order and timing of sections (maybe a section with multiple quick questions vs one big problem).
  - Save these as templates that can be reused for that role.

- **Customization of AI Behavior:** Allow some tuning of Ethan’s interviewing style per role or company:

  - For instance, a company might want a very friendly tone for customer service roles, but a more neutral/professional tone for executive roles. Provide settings such as “Interviewer Tone: friendly/professional/challenging” which modulates how Ethan responds.
  - Ability to add company-specific greetings or sign-offs (like “Welcome to XYZ Company’s interview…”).
  - Option to include some company info or employer branding in the intro or conclusion (this can improve the candidate’s connection to the company – e.g., “At XYZ, collaboration is core to our values, so I’ll be asking about teamwork.”).

- **Question Bank Management:** The platform should maintain a repository of questions/tasks. Admins can:

  - Add new questions (with categories, difficulty, tags for relevant skills).
  - Edit or remove questions that are no longer relevant or if they were faulty.
  - Mark certain questions as active or inactive (useful if a question leaks or becomes overused – they can rotate it out).
  - Import/export questions in bulk (maybe via CSV or an API), useful if they have an existing list of questions.

- **Role-Specific Competency Profiles:** When configuring an interview, the admin can select which competencies or skills to focus on (these would tie to scoring). For example, for a Sales role, they might emphasize communication, persuasion, and product knowledge; for a Developer role, it’s coding, algorithm, debugging, etc. The system should then suggest questions that match those and ensure the scoring aligns. This helps tailor the interview to what matters for that role.
- **Difficulty Level Settings:** For roles that can vary in seniority (junior vs senior engineer), allow adjusting difficulty. Perhaps each question in the bank is rated on difficulty, and the admin can select an overall difficulty level for the interview template, which filters or biases question selection. Or they can manually pick easier or harder questions.
- **Custom Rating Criteria:** If the company has a unique way they rate or specific values, allow adding custom evaluation criteria. For instance, a company might specifically want to rate “Culture Fit” or “Learning Ability”. They should be able to add that as a category the AI will try to assess (with guidance on how to assess it). Alternatively, they could instruct recruiters to manually add that rating after reviewing – but the system should accommodate capturing those ratings in the final report.
- **Preview and Testing:** Before using a custom interview live, recruiters should be able to preview it or even take it themselves (or have a colleague take it) to see how it flows. The system should provide a simulation mode (perhaps with the AI in a “debug” mode that also shows what it’s evaluating, for internal use). This helps the user refine the interview.
- **Localization of Content:** If interviews need to run in multiple languages or regions, allow translating custom questions or providing localized versions. The admin can input a question in multiple languages or use a translation service – Ethan then uses the appropriate version for the candidate’s language choice.
- **Reuse and Templates Marketplace:** Provide default templates for common roles (software engineer, sales rep, customer support, etc.) to help users get started. Also, consider a library or marketplace where proven interview templates can be shared (subject to company privacy – likely only generic ones, not proprietary questions). This could speed up adoption as product managers or HR leads can pick from best practices.
- **Governance of Custom Content:** To maintain quality, if a user creates a very biased or illegal question (e.g., asking about age or other inappropriate topics), the system should warn or prevent it. Perhaps incorporate guidelines or even an AI check that flags questions that might be problematic or not in line with best practices. This protects both the company and ensures Ethan’s usage aligns with ethical standards.
- **Real-Time Editing:** While an interview is in progress, it’s typically static; however, support urgent edits for future sessions. For instance, if a question is found to be flawed one morning, an admin should be able to update it and any interviews conducted afterward use the new version. (Interviews already in flight cannot change of course.)
- **Version Control:** Maintain version history of interview templates and questions. This way, results can be compared properly even if questions change over time (so we know which version of a question a candidate received if needed for analysis). It also helps revert if a new custom question turned out to be too hard or mis-scored.

### Integration and Workflow Automation

**Description:** Ethan must integrate seamlessly into the hiring tech stack. This includes Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), calendar systems for scheduling, and other HR tools. The goal is that using Ethan doesn’t add cumbersome steps; instead, it automates workflow (like scheduling interviews, notifying candidates, updating statuses) as much as possible.

**Requirements:**

- **ATS Integration:** Provide out-of-the-box connectors or an API for major ATS platforms (e.g., Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, Taleo, SAP SuccessFactors). Key integration points:

  - **Candidate Import/Invite:** When a recruiter advances a candidate to the “Interview” stage in ATS, it should trigger an Ethan interview invite. This could be via an API call or webhook. The candidate’s name, email, and desired interview template (based on job role) are passed to Ethan.
  - **Status Updates:** Once the candidate completes the AI interview, Ethan should send back a status update and key results to ATS. For example, mark the stage as completed, attach the score or recommendation, and perhaps a link to the full report in Ethan’s system. This update should be near-real-time to keep recruiters informed.
  - **ATS Data Sync:** Ensure any relevant data stays in sync – e.g., if a candidate withdraws or the job is closed, cancel any pending Ethan interviews for them.
  - We should target a _deep integration_ for popular ATS so that recruiters can largely work from the ATS interface without constantly switching to Ethan’s dashboard. However, Ethan’s own UI will exist for detailed analysis and configuration.

- **Scheduling and Notifications:**

  - **Automatic Interview Scheduling:** The system can eliminate manual scheduling by letting candidates self-serve. For instance, as soon as a candidate is invited (via ATS or Ethan directly), they receive an email (or SMS, or WhatsApp – multi-channel) with a link and instructions to take the interview at their convenience within a specified window (e.g., “Please complete this interview within 5 days.”).
  - **Reminders:** If days pass and the candidate hasn’t completed, automated reminder emails/texts should be sent (e.g., 2 days before deadline, “Don’t forget to complete your interview with Ethan. It’s a chance to show us your skills!”). This ensures higher completion rates.
  - If a more formal scheduling is needed (some companies might want to schedule a specific slot with the candidate for a “proctored” feel), allow integration with calendar systems. For example, provide open slots where the AI is “available” (though technically it’s always available, some organizations might still schedule times). If so, integrate with Outlook/Google Calendar invites. But the expectation is mostly on-demand interviewing rather than fixed slots.

- **API Access:** In addition to ATS integrations, provide a robust REST API (or GraphQL) for all major functions: creating interview requests, retrieving results, adding questions, etc. This allows custom integrations – e.g., a company’s career site could directly trigger an Ethan interview after an application is submitted, via API. Or integration with a chatbot that first screens and then hands off to Ethan. The API should be secure (API keys/OAuth) and well-documented.
- **Webhooks:** Offer webhook notifications for events like “Interview Completed”, “Interview Expired/No-show”, “System Error” etc., so that client systems can react to these events (like send an alert to a recruiter if something failed).
- **Data Export:** Support exporting interview data in common formats. For example, export a CSV of scores for analytics, or export transcripts for storage. Possibly provide integration to HR analytics platforms or BI tools (PowerBI, etc.) by pushing data or connecting to a data warehouse.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** For enterprise, integrate with SSO providers (OAuth, SAML) so that recruiters/admins can log into Ethan’s dashboard with their corporate credentials. This simplifies user management and is often a requirement for enterprise IT.
- **Collaboration Tools Integration:** Optionally, integrate notifications or actions into tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams. E.g., a recruiter could receive a Slack message: “Candidate John Doe has completed the Ethan interview for Software Engineer. Score: 85. Click here to view report.” This meets recruiters where they already communicate.
- **CRM/HRIS Integration:** If needed, integration with candidate relationship management (CRM) tools or HRIS (HR Information Systems) could ensure that once someone is hired, their interview data can be stored or referenced in their profile. Not a core requirement, but having open APIs makes this possible.
- **Workflow Customization:** Companies might have different triggers – e.g., some might want to auto-reject candidates who score below a threshold (with an email sent). The system should allow these automated workflows to be configured:

  - If Score < X: trigger rejection email template via ATS or Ethan.
  - If Score >= Y: trigger scheduling of next-round interview (could integrate with a human interview scheduling tool).
  - If integrity flag: notify a specific user or require manual review.
    These ensure Ethan isn’t a silo but part of an end-to-end hiring flow.

- **Integration Monitoring:** Provide a dashboard or log for integrations so admins can see if everything is working (e.g., “Last 100 ATS callbacks processed successfully” or an error log if something fails, with alerting). This is important so issues (like an ATS API outage) don’t go unnoticed and result in candidates slipping through.
- **Major ATS Support List:** At launch, aim to support the top ATS platforms via native integrations: e.g., Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Taleo, Greenhouse, Lever, SmartRecruiters, iCIMS, etc. If direct integration development is heavy, prioritize a few and use the API approach for others. Eventually, being listed on ATS marketplaces (e.g., Greenhouse’s integration directory) is a goal.

### Scalability and Performance

**Description:** Ethan’s architecture must support high volume usage without compromising performance or quality. This means handling many concurrent interviews, processing real-time audio and AI computations quickly, and scaling elastically with demand. Enterprise clients might run hundreds of interviews in a short span (e.g., campus hiring events) – the system should handle that load reliably.

**Requirements:**

- **Concurrent Interview Capacity:** The system should be able to handle on the order of thousands of simultaneous interviews. Concretely, if 1000 candidates start interviews at the same time (e.g., after a virtual career fair), Ethan should manage these sessions without significant lag. This requires scalable backend services for speech processing and AI analysis. Use cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling (for compute-heavy tasks like speech-to-text and language model processing, potentially containerize and scale out instances).
- **Real-Time Audio Processing:** To maintain a conversational feel, latency in speech recognition and response generation must be minimal. Target: **speech-to-text transcription latency < 2 seconds** for short utterances, and **AI response generation < 2 seconds** for typical replies. In total, the pause between a candidate finishing speaking and Ethan replying should ideally feel like a natural conversational gap (not more than \~3 seconds). Prolonged silences will break the flow. If complex analysis is needed (e.g., evaluating a long answer), Ethan might use filler phrases like “Mm-hmm…” or “Let me think about that” to buy time, but these should be used sparingly.
- **High Availability:** The service should target at least **99.5% uptime** or better, as it will be part of critical hiring processes. Downtime could cause missed interviews or delays. Use redundant servers and failover for major components (e.g., multiple speech recognition nodes, backup interview logic servers). Maintenance deployments should be zero-downtime (rolling updates).
- **Scaling Strategy:** Define how each component scales:

  - The voice interface (STT/TTS) likely uses third-party engines or GPU services – ensure we can scale those (use cloud services that allow burst usage, or maintain a pool of instances).
  - The NLP and evaluation services might use heavy AI models (like large language models for understanding). These could be optimized (distilled models for faster inference, or use a smaller model in real-time and a bigger one for post-interview analysis, balancing speed vs accuracy).
  - Use load balancing and microservice architecture so different interview sessions are handled in parallel across nodes.

- **Performance Metrics & Monitoring:** Continuously monitor system performance:

  - Average and 95th percentile latency of responses.
  - CPU/GPU utilization on servers.
  - Memory usage (especially if many models loaded).
  - Throughput (interviews per hour/day).
    Use these metrics to predict when to add resources.

- **Scalability Testing:** Before launching to big clients, perform load tests simulating heavy usage (e.g., simulate 500 concurrent interviews with realistic audio streams) to ensure the system scales and identify bottlenecks. The PRD acceptance criteria might include achieving a certain concurrency in a staging environment without errors or degradation.
- **Quality Consistency under Load:** It’s not enough to just handle load; the quality of AI decisions should remain consistent. Ensure that when scaling out, all instances use the same updated AI models and question data (i.e., consistent state or quick propagation of any updates). Also, avoid scenarios where heavy load could cause timeouts that skip evaluation steps. For example, ensure each interview session has sufficient compute allocated such that it can run the necessary analysis without timing out or cutting corners.
- **Geographic Scalability:** If serving international candidates, consider deploying services in multiple regions (US, Europe, Asia data centers) to reduce latency for users far from the primary server. Also, ensure compliance with data residency if needed (some EU clients might require data not leave EU – which touches security/compliance too). The system architecture should support multi-region deployments.
- **Video/Audio Streaming Efficiency:** If using any video or just audio, utilize efficient codecs and streaming protocols to minimize bandwidth usage, since any hiccup in audio streaming affects the conversation. The system should handle varying network conditions on the candidate side (e.g., if a candidate has poor internet, maybe the system detects and switches to a low-bandwidth mode or advises the candidate).
- **Storage Scaling:** Potentially thousands of interviews per day, each with an audio recording (and maybe video) plus transcripts, code files, etc. The data storage architecture must scale (probably use cloud object storage for raw media, and a database for transcripts/metadata). Implement lifecycle policies (like archive or delete older interviews after X time if not needed, subject to compliance retention rules) to manage storage growth.
- **Scalable AI Model Training:** On the improvement side, if models are retrained periodically using data, that training process should be scalable (likely using cloud ML services). This is offline from the interview, but worth noting capacity for large datasets as usage grows.

### Pay-As-You-Go Pricing and Transparency

**Description:** Ethan will be offered with a flexible **pay-as-you-go pricing model**, which is attractive especially for organizations with fluctuating hiring volumes. This means clients pay per interview or per usage, rather than large upfront licenses (though subscription models may exist for heavy users). Transparency in pricing and usage is important so clients can clearly see the ROI and costs.

**Requirements:**

- **Usage-Based Billing:** Core pricing likely on a per-interview or per-candidate basis. For example, \$X per interview completed (possibly tiered volume discounts). Alternatively, per minute of interview time for fairness (since a coding interview might last longer than a short screen). The system needs to track these usage metrics precisely for billing.
- **Subscription Options:** Offer packages like a monthly subscription that includes Y interviews per month, or enterprise licenses for unlimited usage with an annual contract. The pricing structure should be flexible to accommodate both small firms (who prefer pay-per-use) and large enterprises (who might budget annually).
- **Transparency Dashboard:** Provide clients a billing/usage dashboard where they can see:

  - Number of interviews conducted in a given period.
  - Breakdowns by type (maybe technical vs non-technical) if pricing differs, or by department if needed.
  - The cost incurred so far (if pay-go) or how close they are to limits (if they have a subscription cap).
  - This should update in near real-time (at least daily).

- **Cost Estimates:** When setting up an interview campaign, show an estimate of cost. E.g., if they invite 100 candidates, and the rate is \$X each, display “Estimated cost if all complete: \$100X”. This helps avoid surprises and allows budgeting.
- **Free Trials / Freemium:** Likely provide a limited free trial (e.g., first 5 interviews free) so new customers can evaluate. The system should support marking certain usage as trial (not billed). Also perhaps a freemium model for small usage – but since this is enterprise-focused, trial is more likely than freemium.
- **Payment Integration:** Integrate with payment systems for self-serve (maybe via credit card for small clients, and invoicing for enterprise). For transparency, invoices should detail usage (e.g., list of interviews or aggregate counts).
- **No Hidden Fees:** Make it clear that features like integration or data export etc. are included or if they cost extra (preferably include basic integration in the package). If some advanced features are add-ons (like advanced analytics module), price them clearly. The product should avoid nickel-and-diming on things that the user might expect to be included; otherwise it might sour the experience.
- **Scalability of Pricing:** Ensure the pricing model accounts for heavy usage and encourages more usage (volume discounts). At the same time, ensure profitability – heavy usage clients might be on contracts. The PRD’s role here is mostly to ensure the system can support these pricing models technically:

  - Tag and count usage per client, handle different rates.
  - Possibly enforce limits if someone goes way beyond subscribed amount (or auto-upgrade them).

- **Cost Optimization for Users:** Provide recommendations to clients on how to optimize cost if applicable. For example, if they often invite 100 candidates but only 50 complete (and they pay per invite), maybe switch to pay per completion or adjust strategy. This is more a customer success aspect but could be facilitated by usage data and configurable settings (like only get charged when interview is completed, etc., if that’s a chosen pricing model).
- **Internal Cost Monitoring:** While transparent to customer is key, also monitor internally the cost to serve (because heavy AI usage like running language models can be expensive). This might involve adding efficient usage or notifying the team if a particular client’s usage spikes unusually (though not directly a user feature, it ensures pricing remains viable).
- **Legal Transparency:** Pricing terms should be clearly laid out in the contract or sign-up. This includes data usage charges if any (e.g., if a client requests raw data exports beyond normal usage, is that extra? Usually not, but clarify). The system should have a way to enforce any such limits.
- **Examples and ROI:** Possibly within the product site or even dashboard, illustrate the ROI of usage. E.g., “This month you spent \$X on Ethan interviews, which replaced an estimated Y hours of recruiter phone screens – a saving of \$Z in recruiter time.” This is not a requirement per se, but a nice transparency/justification feature. Evidence from the industry suggests significant productivity gains (like saving 5 hours per recruiter per day), which can be communicated to clients.

### Continuously Learning AI Models

**Description:** Ethan’s effectiveness relies on its AI models (for conversation, understanding, and evaluation). These models will be **proprietary and continuously refined** with new data to improve accuracy, empathy, and fairness. The PRD outlines how the product should support ongoing AI improvement and what that entails.

**Requirements:**

- **Proprietary AI Stack:** The solution will use a combination of third-party and proprietary AI:

  - Possibly leverage existing large language models for natural language understanding and dialogue (e.g., a GPT-based system fine-tuned for interview Q\&A).
  - Use proprietary models for scoring/evaluation trained on labeled interview data.
  - Possibly use off-the-shelf speech-to-text and text-to-speech engines initially, but with fine-tuning or custom acoustic models for interview scenarios (particularly to handle domain jargon and varied accents better).
    The architecture should allow plugging in improved models at each layer without a complete rewrite (modular design).

- **Training Data Pipeline:** Establish a pipeline to collect and label data from interviews (with appropriate privacy handling). For example:

  - Record transcripts and outcomes (e.g., which candidates succeeded in later rounds or on the job).
  - Use human reviewers to label a subset of data: e.g., have human interviewers rate some recorded answers to feed a supervised model.
  - Continuously update the models using this data to better predict those human judgments or outcomes.

- **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate explicit feedback:

  - Recruiters could provide feedback on the AI’s evaluations (e.g., “I disagree with this recommendation” or “This candidate turned out great, even though Ethan scored low”). Such feedback should be captured easily in the UI.
  - Candidates might give feedback on odd AI behavior (“The AI didn’t understand my answer to question 3”). These could be captured via the satisfaction survey or a support channel.
  - All this feedback becomes part of refining the system – e.g., if multiple users report the AI misinterpreted something, fix that in the NLP model or adjust the phrasing of the question.

- **Regular Model Updates:** Plan for model updates perhaps every quarter or continuous rolling improvements:

  - Each update must be tested to ensure it’s an improvement (A/B test if possible, or on historical data).
  - Backward compatibility or recalibration might be needed – e.g., scores might shift if the model changes, so communicate significant changes to clients. Possibly always version the scoring model and note the version in reports.

- **Domain Expansion:** As new job types use Ethan, the AI might face vocabulary or scenarios it wasn’t originally trained on. The team should proactively incorporate new domain knowledge:

  - For example, if a client starts using it for a medical domain role, ensure the AI is updated with relevant medical terminology and that evaluation criteria are adjusted for that domain (maybe via custom model or additional training on domain data).

- **Human Oversight Mechanism:** Especially early on, allow humans to review certain interviews for quality control. For instance, have an internal “AI audit” team that looks at a random sample of interviews and sees if the AI did well. The product should facilitate this by storing data and possibly providing an internal annotation tool (not necessarily customer-facing, but for the development team).
- **Performance Metrics for AI:** Track metrics like:

  - Speech recognition accuracy (maybe measured by word error rate on some sample each month).
  - NLP understanding accuracy (how often does it misunderstand an answer’s intent – possibly measured via manual review or user feedback).
  - Prediction accuracy (if the AI recommends reject but a candidate eventually gets hired and performs well, that’s a false negative – track the rate of such cases where known; similarly false positives).
  - Bias/fairness metrics: monitor if scores differ significantly by demographic group controlling for actual performance (this requires demographic data if available, and careful analysis – a feature for internal monitoring to then adjust model if needed).

- **Model Personalization per Client:** In the long run, some clients might want their own data to tailor the model (e.g., the qualities that predict success at their specific company). The product should consider supporting custom model tweaks or weighting based on client-specific outcomes (while still leveraging the global model strengths). Initially, this might be manual consulting rather than a fully automated feature.
- **Staying Current with AI Tech:** The architecture should be flexible to incorporate new advancements (e.g., if a new, more efficient language model emerges, or better voice tech, we want to swap that in). Avoid hard-coding to one vendor’s AI. Use abstractions (for instance, a module for “Question Answering LLM” that could be our own model or an API to an external service, which can be changed behind the scenes).
- **Intellectual Property:** Ensure models and training data (especially data derived from client interviews) are handled to maintain our IP and also respect client confidentiality. Perhaps aggregate learning across clients in a way that no sensitive info is exposed. Legally, include in contracts that data may be used to improve the product in anonymized form, with an option for clients to opt out if they are very sensitive (but that might degrade model performance for them).
- **Continuous Improvement Examples:** For instance, after deploying Ethan, we might realize that candidates often give a certain type of answer that the system doesn’t fully get. We then update the model to handle it. Or maybe initial version struggles with very long answers – we improve the segmentation and analysis of long responses. The requirement is that the product team will regularly gather these insights and push improvements, and the system architecture and release process must support that seamlessly.

### Behavioral Pattern Analysis and Fraud Signals

_(Note: This partly overlaps with cheating detection, but extends to general candidate evaluation insights from behavior. Given it was listed separately (#16) and partly covered, we ensure all aspects are captured.)_

**Description:** Beyond detecting cheating, Ethan’s analysis of behavioral patterns can also enhance evaluation of candidates (e.g., identifying hesitation might indicate uncertainty on a topic, consistent speech patterns might reflect confidence, etc.). This feature leverages behavioral signals to enrich both fraud detection and candidate competency assessment.

**Requirements:**

- **Baseline Behavior Profiling:** The system can establish a “baseline” of the candidate’s normal behavior during the interview (in the early questions). Deviations later on could signal something noteworthy. For example, if a candidate is generally quick to answer behavioral questions but suddenly very slow and monotone on a technical question, it could indicate they are out of their depth (or cheating by looking something up). Either way, it’s a signal for evaluation.
- **Voice Tone and Energy Analysis:** Analyze the candidate’s tone, pitch, and pace. A very monotone or low-energy response might indicate disengagement or nervousness; an enthusiastic tone might indicate passion for the topic. While these should not override content, they can be noted as part of the overall impression (e.g., “Candidate spoke passionately when describing past projects, indicating high engagement.” or “Candidate’s tone was flat during the case discussion, which could suggest uncertainty.”).
- **Consistency Checks:** Compare a candidate’s statements for consistency. For example, if they claim expertise in something early on but later cannot answer a fundamental question in that area, that inconsistency is a red flag either for honesty or actual skill gap. The AI can catch such things and either follow up (“Earlier you mentioned you’re comfortable with X, but it seems this question was challenging; could you clarify your experience with X?”) or at least note it in the report.
- **Micro-expression / Sentiment (if video):** If video is used, analyzing facial micro-expressions or body language could provide signals (though this is controversial and must be done carefully to avoid pseudoscience interpretations). Possibly detect obvious discomfort or excitement. But since primarily voice, we focus on voice cues.
- **Verbal Fluency and Cohesion:** The pattern of speaking – does the candidate ramble, or do they structure their answers logically? The AI can parse whether the answer had a clear structure (which is often a good sign, especially for behavioral questions). If not, note “answers were disorganized or tangential at times.”
- **Cognitive Processing Clues:** Pauses and self-corrections can indicate how the candidate thinks. For instance, pausing to think (with some “let me consider…”) is normal; constant long pauses might show difficulty. Self-correcting (“Actually, let me rephrase that…”) can show reflection. These patterns could subtly inform scoring (communication or problem-solving process).
- **Pattern-Based Fraud Signals:** On cheating specifically, anomaly detection algorithms can be employed. For example, train a model on many honest interviews to recognize typical patterns (in timing, speech, etc.), and flag outliers. E.g., if someone’s answers have zero hesitation and are overly perfect for every single question (which is unusual for a human), maybe that’s AI-generated. Or if the latency between question and answer is statistically abnormal.
- **Dashboard for Recruiter (Behavioral Insights):** Present some of these behavioral findings in a human-friendly way in reports:

  - Possibly a section “Behavioral Insights” saying things like “Candidate appeared **confident** and **articulate**: spoke at length with minimal prompting.” or “Candidate showed **signs of nervousness**: frequent pauses and needed reassurance.”
  - These can help a recruiter get a sense of the person behind the scores. However, caution: ensure these are phrased as observations, not definitive judgments, to avoid misinterpretation.

- **Fraud Alert Handling:** If certain behavioral flags strongly suggest cheating, beyond flagging, maybe route those cases specially. Perhaps the system can automatically queue a re-test for the candidate (e.g., invite them to a second interview with a note “to verify results”) or alert a compliance officer. This could be part of a broader anti-fraud workflow.
- **Anomaly Library:** Keep a catalog of known cheating behaviors (like reading off answers, multiple voice instances, etc.) and known benign behaviors (like slow speech due to translation in head) so that the AI can improve differentiation. For instance, a non-native speaker might pause often not to cheat but to translate mentally; the system should learn to distinguish that (maybe by their overall language proficiency which can be detected by other means).
- **Continuous Tuning:** As with other AI aspects, refine the behavioral analysis through feedback. If recruiters say “this candidate wasn’t cheating, they were just really good,” but the system flagged them, adjust thresholds or model weights. Or if someone cheated and wasn’t caught, analyze what pattern was missed and add it.

_(Effectively, this requirement reinforces and expands on cheating detection, ensuring that behavioral pattern analysis is both a fraud measure and an evaluative measure. We have integrated most points to avoid duplication.)_

### Collaborative and Thought-Process-Oriented Interview Style

**Description:** Ethan’s interviewing approach is **collaborative**, meaning it engages the candidate in a dialogue that draws out their thinking process. This contrasts with a rigid Q\&A where the candidate might only give final answers. By encouraging candidates to articulate their reasoning, Ethan not only makes the experience more conversational but also gains better insight into the candidate’s analytical process and creativity.

**Requirements:**

- **Follow-up Prompts for Reasoning:** After a candidate answers, especially for problem-solving questions, Ethan frequently follows up with prompts like “How did you arrive at that answer?” or “Can you walk me through your thinking?” This invites the candidate to elaborate on their thought process if they haven’t already.
- **Guiding Without Giving Away Answers:** If a candidate is stuck, Ethan can ask guided questions that a human interviewer might, to spur thinking without directly giving the answer. For example, “Have you considered edge cases for that algorithm?” or “Maybe think about what happens if the input is very large.” This not only helps the candidate progress (reducing frustration) but also lets them demonstrate how they use hints – which is telling of coachability and problem-solving.
- **Dynamic Scenario Evolution:** For case studies or design questions, Ethan can introduce new information or twists as a collaboration. E.g., “Now, let’s assume the client’s budget is cut in half, how would that change your recommendation?” This simulates a real collaborative discussion and tests adaptability.
- **Encouraging Questions from Candidates:** A truly collaborative interview allows the candidate to ask clarifying questions or seek feedback. Ethan should handle this gracefully:

  - If a candidate asks a question (e.g., “Do you want me to focus on X or Y aspect?”), Ethan answers like a human would (“It’s up to you – but perhaps consider X first.” if that’s appropriate guidance).
  - If the candidate checks in (“Am I on the right track?”), Ethan can respond in a neutral encouraging way, “You’re exploring a valid approach, keep going” or give a mild redirect if they are way off, without directly solving it.

- **Think-Aloud Normalization:** At the start of complex tasks, Ethan might explicitly encourage thinking aloud: “Feel free to share your thoughts as you work on this; I’m interested in how you approach the problem.” This signals that the candidate won’t be interrupted and that it’s okay to speak their mind. It’s akin to pairing with the candidate as they solve something.
- **Partial Credit and Iteration:** In a collaborative style, if a candidate gives a partially correct answer, Ethan might say, “That’s a good start. What about factor Z? How would that affect things?” – nudging them to refine their answer. This way, if the candidate can correct or improve their answer with a hint, it shows learning ability and resilience, which is valuable information. (The system should note that the final answer came after a hint, but still credit their ability to follow the hint).
- **Avoid adversarial tone:** The AI interviewer should not be adversarial or overly challenging in a negative way. Collaborative means even tough questions are posed with a helpful demeanor. For example, instead of saying “No, that’s wrong,” Ethan can say, “I see. There might be another aspect to consider, for instance X. How would you incorporate that?” – essentially turning it into a co-solving exercise.
- **Concluding Collaborative Reflection:** At the end of the interview or section, Ethan might ask a reflective question like, “How do you think you did on that exercise?” This meta-question lets the candidate voice their own assessment or mention anything they would have done differently. It encourages a moment of reflection which can also reveal self-awareness.
- **Capturing Thought Process in Report:** Ensure that the reports reflect not only the final answers but the candidate’s approach. For example, “Approach: Candidate methodically tried a brute-force solution, then recognized the inefficiency and pivoted to a better algorithm after a hint. This shows learning and adaptability.” This level of detail is only possible if the interview was interactive enough to see that pivot.
- **Training the AI for Dialogue:** This requires the underlying AI to handle multi-turn reasoning discussions. Likely, the dialogue system should have a memory of what the candidate said and what hints were given, etc., to continue the thread. It’s more complex than isolated Q\&A but is achievable with stateful dialogue management (potentially using an LLM that is prompted with the full conversation context).
- **Maintain Timing in Collaboration:** One challenge: collaborative deep dives can consume time. The system should monitor time and ensure it still covers necessary topics. Perhaps limit each deep dive to a few exchanges unless the candidate is doing extremely well and time permits. This might mean one or two follow-ups per question is typical. Also possibly configurable (some recruiters might say “just ask the question and move on”, while others want the follow-ups).
- **Candidate Engagement Metrics:** Collaborative style is expected to increase engagement – possibly measure how much candidates speak (word count) or how often they respond with long answers. A high engagement (candidate speaking a lot, asking questions) generally indicates a good experience and good collaboration. The system can track these as secondary metrics. In any case, anecdotal feedback from candidates about the interview feeling like a conversation rather than an interrogation would validate this approach (to be gathered via surveys).

### Positive Candidate Experience Across Demographics

**Description:** This item underscores that Ethan should deliver a consistently positive and fair experience to all candidates, regardless of background. While many points for positive experience have been covered, here we ensure **fairness, diversity & inclusion considerations** are explicitly addressed.

**Requirements:**

- **Bias Mitigation in AI:** The AI models (both for interviewing and scoring) must be trained and tested to avoid bias against any group. For example:

  - Ensure the speech recognition works well for different accents and dialects (we don’t want candidates with certain accents to be mis-transcribed, hurting their score). If needed, include diverse voice data in training and test WER (word error rate) by demographic.
  - Ensure the language model doesn’t have cultural bias – e.g., not valuing certain communication styles over others unless relevant. Evaluate if any score outputs correlate with gender, race, age in ways that are not job-related, and adjust. Use techniques like removing demographic cues from input for decision-making to focus purely on content.

- **Inclusive Question Set:** The questions themselves should be reviewed for bias. Avoid culturally specific references or sports analogies, etc., that might advantage some groups. Keep them neutral or universally understandable. If any question potentially could disadvantage a group, either avoid it or allow an alternative. For example, brain teasers that assume knowledge of Western nursery rhymes (there have been such infamous puzzles) would be out.
- **Demographic Feedback Analysis:** If possible (some companies track EEOC data), allow analysis of scores by demographic to ensure fairness. Internally, we might want to measure that our AI’s recommendations don’t systematically favor or disfavor any group. This may be done as part of model evaluation. From a product standpoint, we could provide a periodic report to clients like “AI interview pass rates by gender/race for your pipeline” to help them ensure fairness (this is sensitive, but larger clients might do this analysis themselves if they use the product heavily).
- **Candidate Consent & Explanation:** Some candidates may feel uneasy being interviewed by an AI. Provide upfront explanation and assurance. Possibly in the invitation email or intro: “This interview is conducted by an AI assistant. It will ask you questions and record your responses. Rest assured, the AI has been designed to give everyone an equal opportunity and your responses will be evaluated fairly. A human will review results as needed.” Transparency can help allay concerns, especially for those unfamiliar with AI interviews.
- **Option to Opt for Human:** In case a candidate is not comfortable with AI (e.g., maybe older candidates or others), the system or company might offer an alternative (like a human phone screen). This is more of a policy than a feature, but the product could support it by flagging those who request a human interview, and handling scheduling for a human interviewer in those cases. It’s important for inclusion to not disadvantage someone who isn’t tech-savvy or comfortable.
- **Language & Accent Accommodation:** If a candidate is non-native in the interview language and struggles, Ethan can detect that and perhaps slow down its speech or switch to simpler wording. Or if multi-language is available, it could offer “Would you prefer to continue in Spanish?” if it detects the candidate is more fluent there (assuming the job allows that). This kind of accommodation can vastly improve the experience for global talent.
- **Respectful and Neutral Tone:** Ensure Ethan’s phrasing is always respectful and professional to all. Avoid any slang or idioms that might not translate. The persona should be polite and encouraging, which generally suits all demographics. If any cultural references are used (likely not, since it’s professional), they should be globally accessible.
- **Accessibility Reiteration:** We mentioned accessibility in candidate experience – this also ties to demographics (e.g., disabled candidates). Ensure legal compliance with ADA guidelines, etc. If a candidate cannot use the voice format due to disability, the system must accommodate an equivalent alternative (text interview or a live person as fallback). The product offering should include guidance for such cases to clients.
- **High Satisfaction Metrics:** Aim for candidate satisfaction (measured via surveys or NPS) to be high and with minimal variance between groups. For example, if the satisfaction of male vs female candidates diverged, investigate why. Our acceptance criteria could be something like “achieve >85% positive feedback from candidates in pilot, with no significant difference across demographic segments.” That ensures broad positive impact.
- **Case Study – Positive Feedback:** (This is more context) There have been examples where well-designed AI interviews reduced stress because candidates felt they weren’t being judged by a human and could do it on their own time. We aim to replicate that by design. So, qualitatively, look for feedback like “It felt weird at first but I actually enjoyed this more than a normal interview” or “I felt less nervous talking to the AI.” Such feedback indicates success.

_(With this, we have covered all key capabilities listed by the user in a structured manner.)_

---

The above functional requirements outline what Ethan must do. Next, we detail non-functional requirements and other aspects to ensure the product’s robustness and success.

## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements cover the qualities and constraints of the system beyond specific features. These ensure Ethan is reliable, secure, easy to use, and maintainable.

### Reliability & Availability

- **Uptime:** The system should be highly reliable. Target a minimum **99.5% uptime** (approx <\~4 hours downtime per month) in production, ideally 99.9% for critical seasons. This will be formalized in SLAs for enterprise customers.
- **Redundancy:** No single point of failure in the architecture. Use redundant servers for critical components (voice processing, core logic). If one server goes down, another takes over active sessions seamlessly if possible.
- **Graceful Degradation:** If certain services fail (e.g., the code judge service for coding problems), Ethan should gracefully handle it (maybe apologize to candidate and skip that section rather than crash the interview). Any such incident should be clearly logged and flagged to ops to fix ASAP.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to avoid session drops. For example, if STT fails for a moment, ask the candidate to repeat rather than freezing. The interview session should be able to continue if network blips or minor issues occur. Possibly allow a session to reconnect if a candidate’s internet drops temporarily.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure no data loss of interview records. All recordings, transcripts, and reports must be saved transactionally. Use reliable storage and backups (e.g., nightly backups of databases, versioning in object storage). In case of partial failure during an interview, what was recorded so far should be saved and marked incomplete.

### Performance (Response Time, Throughput)

- **Real-time Response:** As discussed, the system should respond to user inputs within a few seconds to feel interactive. Specifically, voice responses generated by the AI should typically have **latency < 3 seconds** after the candidate stops speaking. Longer analytical responses (like after a coding section) should be < 5-10 seconds with a waiting message if needed.
- **Throughput:** The system will support processing **hundreds of interviews concurrently**. The backend should be horizontally scalable. For initial benchmarks, aim for supporting 200 concurrent sessions with average 1.5x real-time processing (which is quite heavy) across X servers. Then scale beyond with additional hardware.
- **Resource Usage:** The application should efficiently use resources like CPU, GPU, memory. For instance, load AI models into memory once and reuse across sessions to avoid re-loading overhead. Use caching for any repeated operations (like question content, or TTS audio snippets if reused). Monitor performance and optimize hot spots in code (e.g., if one part of NLP is slow, consider C++ optimization or a faster library).
- **Client-Side Performance:** The candidate-facing web interface should load quickly (< 3 seconds load time on typical broadband) and be responsive. Audio streaming should not stutter on typical connections (requires good encoding and buffering strategies). Support at least Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge recent versions, and mobile browsers.
- **Scalability Testing:** Non-functional acceptance includes performing stress tests to ensure linear scaling (within reason). If doubling the server instances doubles the capacity, we know it scales horizontally. Identify any bottlenecks (like a database that might need sharding or a stateful component that needs partitioning) early.

### Security

- **Data Encryption:** All candidate data must be protected. **Encryption in transit** (HTTPS for all communications, secure websockets for audio streaming). **Encryption at rest** for stored data (recordings, transcripts, personal info). Use strong encryption (AES-256, etc.) and proper key management.
- **Access Control:** Implement role-based access for the system:

  - Only authorized recruiters or hiring managers can view interview results for their candidates.
  - Candidates can only access their own interview session.
  - Admins have elevated privileges to configure system but even they shouldn’t see candidate data from other companies. Each client’s data must be logically separated (multi-tenant secure design). Possibly use separate databases or at least tenant IDs on all data with checks.

- **Authentication:** Support SSO for enterprise (as mentioned) and strong password policies for any native accounts. Use multi-factor authentication for admin accounts.
- **Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Management:** The system should undergo regular security audits and pen tests. Address any OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities in web interface or API (XSS, SQL injection, etc.). Code should be secure (input sanitization, no leaking keys/tokens, etc.).
- **Privacy Compliance:** Adhere to regulations like **GDPR** (for EU, allow candidates to request deletion of their data; get explicit consent for recording, etc.), **CCPA** (California), and any other relevant laws. Provide a clear privacy policy. Possibly build features to automate compliance, like a tool to delete or anonymize candidate data after a retention period.
- **Audit Logging:** Keep secure logs of important actions: e.g., admin changes settings, user accesses data, etc. This provides audit trails if any security or compliance review is needed. Ensure logs themselves are secure and not easily accessible except by authorized personnel.
- **Secure Development:** Non-functional but process: follow secure coding standards, train the dev team on security. All third-party libraries used should be up-to-date and monitored for vulnerabilities.
- **Data Isolation:** One company’s data should never leak to another. Multi-tenant architecture should be robust. Possibly give option for a dedicated instance or VPC for very large clients who demand isolation.
- **Consent Mechanisms:** As mentioned, ensure candidates explicitly consent to being recorded and evaluated by AI. Log this consent. Provide an option to decline (which then notifies recruiter to arrange a human process as alternative, rather than forcing them). This both ethically and legally covers the usage.
- **Admin Controls:** Provide admin settings to configure data retention, to purge data, or to retrieve data for compliance inquiries (e.g., if a candidate asks for all their data, admin can export their interview recording and scores).

### Compliance and Ethics

- **EEO Compliance:** Ensure the system’s usage is consistent with Equal Employment Opportunity laws. The AI should not use any protected characteristics in decision-making. The company should be able to show that interview questions are job-related and consistent for all candidates for a role (the customization system and templating ensures consistency). We should provide documentation or guidelines to clients on proper use to stay compliant.
- **AI Ethics & Transparency:** If any jurisdictions require disclosure of AI in hiring (some places have emerging laws requiring candidates be informed of AI evaluation and possibly audited for bias), ensure the product can assist clients in compliance. For instance:

  - Provide an **AI bias audit** report on request, which might include results of fairness testing.
  - Provide a summary of how the AI works that clients can share if needed.
  - Possibly allow third-party auditors to evaluate our models on fairness (which means we need to keep data and model access for such audits, under NDA etc.).

- **HR Standards:** Align with professional HR standards like **ISO 30405 (Recruitment)** or others if applicable, which emphasize transparency, validity of assessments, etc. This is more about design principles but might come up in enterprise RFPs.
- **Third-Party Certifications:** Aim for relevant certifications to build trust:

  - **SOC 2 Type II** for security of the platform (as a SaaS).
  - Eventually, maybe **ISO 27001** for information security management.
  - These are non-functional requirements in that we need to design processes and platform to meet those standards (e.g., data handling, change management).

- **Data Residency:** Compliance might require hosting data in certain regions. The product should offer options (e.g., EU customer data stays on EU servers). That might be a deployment/timeframe thing to plan.
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensure the platform front-end meets standards (like WCAG 2.1 AA) for accessibility – this is both ethical and in some places legally required. E.g., government agencies might demand Section 508 compliance in the US.
- **Continuous Compliance Monitoring:** Keep track of emerging regulations (AI hiring laws). For example, Illinois has a law about AI interview video analysis requiring certain notices and limits. We have to adapt product to any such laws: e.g., maybe provide candidates an option to receive their evaluation or to opt out of certain analysis if law requires. Non-functional but important to incorporate compliance as a living aspect.

### Usability & Accessibility

- **Clean UI/UX:** The user interfaces (for candidates and recruiters) should be intuitive, modern, and uncluttered. Use consistent branding and simple navigation. For recruiters, the dashboard should highlight the key info (candidate list, scores) and allow drill-down without unnecessary clicks. For candidates, the interface should basically be “click Start and talk” with minimal other buttons.
- **Instructions & Support:** Provide tooltips or help content in the interface where needed. E.g., for candidates, maybe a quick tutorial or an FAQ: “What if I need a break?” or “How to ensure your microphone works” etc. For recruiters, info icons next to metrics (“How is the Problem-Solving score calculated? Click to learn more.”).
- **Responsive Design:** Works on various screen sizes. Many candidates might use a laptop or phone; ensure mobile web is tested. Recruiter interface might mainly be desktop but should still function on tablet etc.
- **Speed:** UI should feel snappy (sub-second transitions) outside of the AI response times which we cannot fully eliminate. Use loading indicators appropriately (e.g., “Analyzing response...” spinner while AI thinks, but also consider async design where analysis of earlier questions can happen while candidate moves to next perhaps).
- **Internationalization:** Aside from language support in AI, also allow the UI text to be localized (for candidate interface especially). If a client has a Spanish-speaking population, the instructions and buttons should be translatable. The platform should support multiple locales.
- **Documentation & Training:** Have user guides for recruiters/admins so they can utilize all features (like customizing interviews). Possibly embed a tutorial or provide sample templates in the interface for learning.
- **Support Contacts:** Non-functional, but ensure there’s a way for users to get support – e.g., a help center link, or chat support (especially for recruiters using the system). For candidates, provide a support email or chat if they have tech issues during the process. Ideally, minimal issues, but must be there.
- **Maintenance and Updates:** Ensure that when updates happen, they do not disrupt ongoing user activities. Possibly notify recruiters of major changes ahead of time (release notes). For cloud software, do rolling deployments and avoid downtime in middle of a work day.
- **Debugging Info (internal):** For troubleshooting, perhaps have a hidden key combo or something for support team to see detailed logs on the client side if a candidate has an issue (like what their mic input levels are, etc.). Not user-facing but helps support usability by resolving problems quickly.
- **User Acceptance:** Consider a beta program with friendly users to gather UI/UX feedback and iterate. The UI should be refined with actual user input to ensure it meets their needs and is simple to use.

### Maintainability & Extensibility

- **Modular Architecture:** The system should be built in a modular way (as evident in architecture section). Each component (STT, NLP, logic, etc.) can be updated or replaced without rewriting the whole system. For example, if we switch TTS provider, it should be a contained change. Or if we add a new interview format, we can plug in that module.
- **Configurable Logic:** Many aspects should be configurable via external config or database rather than hardcoded, to allow adjustments without code changes (e.g., scoring weights, time limits, threshold for flags, etc.). This will make tuning easier as we learn from use.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Comprehensive logs at each step (with correlation IDs per interview session to trace a whole conversation). Monitoring dashboards for system health, as well as business metrics (like number of interviews done). This helps maintain and improve the system.
- **Automated Testing:** Create a suite of automated tests for the AI and non-AI parts. For instance:

  - Simulated interviews to test end-to-end flow (with a test harness providing canned audio answers and verifying outputs).
  - Unit tests for scoring logic.
  - Security tests for API endpoints.
    CI/CD should run these to catch issues quickly.

- **Documentation (Internal):** Dev team should maintain up-to-date documentation of the system design, APIs, and model behavior for easier onboarding of new developers and collaboration.
- **Extensibility:** If new features are requested (like supporting a video interview or integrating a new assessment type like coding assignment upload), the architecture should accommodate adding those with moderate effort. The PRD intentionally already includes many to be future-proof, but unknown features should not break design.
- **Backward Compatibility:** As we update AI models or scoring, ensure the system can handle old data. If we change scoring algorithm, maybe keep old scores for past interviews as they were (don’t recompute them unpredictably). If we add new question types, ensure older interview templates still run or get migrated gracefully.
- **Scalable Team Processes:** The product should consider maintainability in terms of team – allow multiple teams to work on different components concurrently (via clear interfaces between modules, microservices maybe). This way as we scale development, people can enhance one area (like cheat detection) while others work on UI, etc., with minimal conflicts.

These non-functional aspects ensure Ethan is robust, user-friendly, and can evolve over time.

## Interview Flow and Interaction Diagrams

To illustrate how Ethan operates, this section describes the typical **interview flow** from start to finish, with an interaction diagram for clarity.

&#x20;_Figure 1: High-level system architecture and data flow for Ethan AI Interviewer._ The candidate interacts via voice with Ethan (speech is converted to text, understood by the AI, and responses/questions are spoken back). The system’s internal components handle question logic, evaluation, and integration with ATS for results.

**Typical Interview Flow:** (for a technical role example)

1. **Invitation & Setup:** The candidate receives an invite (via email with a secure link) to take an Ethan interview. They click the link, which opens Ethan’s web interface. They grant microphone permission and see a welcome screen. They can optionally read instructions or FAQs.
2. **Introduction:** Ethan’s voice greets the candidate: “Hello, thanks for taking the time to interview. My name is Ethan, and I’ll be conducting this interview. \[Friendly intro and instructions]. Let’s start with a few questions about your background.”
3. **Warm-up Questions:** Ethan might begin with a simple ice-breaker or confirm basic info: “Can you briefly introduce yourself and what attracted you to this role?” The candidate responds; Ethan actively listens and gives a brief acknowledgment or follow-up question on something they said (keeping it conversational).
4. **Behavioral Questions:** Ethan asks a behavioral question, e.g., “Tell me about a challenging project you led.” The candidate answers at length. During this, Ethan’s STT transcribes in real time. The NLP identifies that the candidate mentioned a conflict resolution. Ethan might follow up: “You mentioned a conflict with the client – how did you resolve that?” The candidate elaborates. Ethan nods verbally (“I see, that’s helpful.”) and continues. This part assesses teamwork, leadership, etc.
5. **Transition to Technical Section:** Ethan says, “Great, now we will move to a technical problem solving exercise. I’ll describe a problem, and I’d like you to talk me through how you’d solve it, then write some code.” The candidate confirms they’re ready.
6. **Coding Challenge:** Ethan presents the coding question: “Given a list of numbers, find the longest increasing sequence…” (for example). This is also shown on screen in a code editor. Ethan asks the candidate to think aloud and then start coding when ready.

   - The candidate perhaps outlines their approach verbally (“I would use dynamic programming…”). Ethan encourages if needed: “Sounds good, you can start implementing that. Let me know if you want to run the code.”
   - The candidate writes code in the editor, speaking occasionally. Ethan’s IDE integration might highlight syntax or allow running tests. Suppose the first run fails a test; Ethan says, “One of the test cases failed, consider edge cases like empty input.” The candidate debugs and fixes the code.
   - Once passing, Ethan asks a couple of follow-up questions: “Why is your solution efficient? What’s the complexity?” The candidate answers. Ethan might probe: “Can it handle very large input efficiently?” to which the candidate responds with complexity analysis.

7. **Case/Design Question (if any):** After coding, Ethan could ask a high-level design question (if part of this interview): e.g., “How would you design a system to handle millions of users…?” The candidate gives a structured answer. Ethan asks clarifications similar to how a system design interviewer would (“What database would you choose and why?” etc.).
8. **Closing Questions:** Ethan wraps up with a question like, “Do you have any questions for me or anything you’d like to add?” The candidate might ask about next steps or just say thank you. Ethan provides a polite closing: “Thank you for your time. It was great speaking with you. Our team will review your interview and get back to you soon. Have a great day!”
9. **Post-Interview Processing:** As soon as the interview ends, Ethan’s back-end finalizes the analysis. The candidate’s every response has been evaluated (some in real-time, some post facto like running full code tests or doing additional NLP sentiment analysis). Within a few minutes (or faster), the compiled **interview report** is ready. The candidate receives a message confirming completion.
10. **ATS Update & Recruiter Notification:** The system sends the results to the ATS and/or an email to the recruiter: e.g., “Interview Complete: Jane Doe – Software Engineer. Score: 82. Recommendation: Proceed to Next Round. Click to view full report.” The recruiter can click through to the Ethan dashboard to review details.
11. **Recruiter Review:** On the Ethan platform, the recruiter sees Jane’s transcript, her code solution and results, scores on each competency, and any flags (none in this scenario, assume it was clean). They note the strong coding score and good problem-solving comments from Ethan. They decide to move Jane to the next stage (an on-site interview). They might send her a quick personalized note as well, thanking her and scheduling next round (the scheduling could even be automated if integrated).
12. **Candidate Follow-up:** Optionally, if configured, the candidate might get an email with a brief **feedback summary** or at least a thank-you note and next steps info. For instance, “Thank you for completing the AI interview. We were impressed with your skills in X. Our team will be in touch about next steps.” This leaves a positive impression. If the candidate is not moving forward, the system could send a polite rejection email, potentially mentioning some generic feedback (if allowed).

During this flow, behind the scenes, various diagrams illustrate interactions:

- **Sequence Diagram (simplified):** Candidate speaks -> Ethan (STT -> NLP): processes answer -> Ethan (Logic): decides next question -> Ethan (TTS): asks next question -> (loop). Meanwhile, evaluation is logging scores.
- **Integration Flow:** At end, Ethan -> ATS: sends results JSON or via API. ATS -> Recruiter: updates status visible. If scheduling next, ATS or Ethan triggers scheduling app -> Candidate.

All these ensure a smooth end-to-end process.

The above flow can be adjusted for different formats (e.g., purely behavioral interviews would just skip coding and have more situational questions; or if it was a screening call style, maybe shorter).

**Interaction Diagram Key Points:** The embedded Figure 1 diagram shows how the **Candidate**’s voice goes into Ethan’s system (through Speech-to-Text engine), how the **Interview Logic** and **NLP analysis** interpret it to generate dynamic responses (through TTS output). The **Evaluation & Scoring module** and **Behavioral Fraud Detection** run in parallel, analyzing content and behavior, and then results are sent to the **ATS integration** which in turn communicates to the **Recruiter/HR** systems. This architecture ensures modular handling of each stage of the interaction.

## System Architecture

This section describes Ethan’s system architecture, including major components, their interactions, and how data flows. The architecture is designed to be **modular, scalable, and secure**, aligning with the requirements above.

**Overview:** Ethan’s system is composed of several layers:

1. **User Interface Layer:** This includes the Candidate App (web/mobile interface for the interview) and the Recruiter Dashboard.
2. **AI Interview Service Layer:** Core services that power the interview:

   - Speech-to-Text (STT) Service
   - Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Dialog Management
   - Interview Logic/Orchestration
   - Text-to-Speech (TTS) Service
   - Evaluation & Scoring Service
   - Behavioral Analysis & Fraud Detection

3. **Integration & Data Layer:**

   - ATS/HRIS Integration API
   - Database(s) for storing interview data, questions, and results
   - External services (for example, a coding execution service, if using something like a sandbox for running code).

From the earlier figure and flow, we detail each component:

- **Candidate Interface (Front-end):** A web application (could be React-based) that handles audio I/O and displays text/instructions. It connects to the backend via secure WebSocket or similar for streaming audio and receiving audio responses (or via REST for non-streaming parts). It also shows any on-screen content (like coding environment embedded via an iframe or module). This front-end must handle real-time feedback (like showing recording levels, etc.) and error messages (e.g., “connection lost, trying to reconnect”).

- **Recruiter Dashboard (Front-end):** Another web interface for recruiters and admins. This communicates with backend APIs to fetch candidate results, manage templates, etc. It may be a separate app or part of a unified interface with role-based views.

- **Voice Processing**:

  - **Speech-to-Text Engine:** Converts the candidate’s spoken answers to text in real time. Could be based on a cloud service (Google Cloud Speech, Azure Cognitive Services, etc.) or an on-prem model (like Vosk or DeepSpeech tuned for our needs). We might start with a reliable third-party for accuracy and then consider a custom model for cost at scale. This service streams text to the Dialog Manager as the candidate speaks (with slight buffering).
  - **Text-to-Speech Engine:** Converts Ethan’s textual responses/questions into spoken audio. Similarly could use a service (e.g., Amazon Polly, Google TTS) to get a natural voice. For real-time, we may use faster neural voices that can generate near real-time. Possibly pre-generate some prompts (like common phrases or initial instructions) to save time. The TTS outputs audio that is streamed to the candidate’s interface for playback.

- **Dialog Management & NLP:** This is the “brain” that understands candidate input and decides on responses.

  - **NLU (Natural Language Understanding):** It takes transcribed text and does intent analysis, entity extraction, sentiment, etc., as needed. It maps the answer to the context of the question. For example, if the question was coding-related, it might parse out if the candidate mentioned a particular algorithm. If behavioral, it may detect what scenario they described (leadership, conflict, etc.). This likely involves either rule-based components or an ML model (like a fine-tuned transformer that can classify or summarize answers).
  - **Dialog Manager/Interview Logic:** This component keeps track of the interview state (which question we’re on, what follow-ups were asked, time remaining, etc.). It decides what the next prompt or action is. It uses inputs from NLU (e.g., if the candidate’s answer is complete or if more probing needed) and also the predefined interview template. Essentially, it’s a state machine with AI augmentation: it can branch (for example, if cheating flagged, maybe alter behavior; or if candidate has answered everything sufficiently, maybe skip to next section). The logic ensures the interview flows as designed.
  - **Question Bank/Knowledge Base:** Not a separate “server” but the logic references the stored questions and scenarios. It might also query a knowledge base if needed (like for follow-ups, or to fetch additional data for a case study).
  - Possibly, a **Generative AI** component is in here for on-the-fly follow-up generation. E.g., if using GPT-like tech: after a candidate answer, the system could generate a pertinent follow-up question not pre-scripted. This would be constrained by context to ensure relevance. (This is advanced, maybe in later versions, but architecture should allow plugging that in.)

- **Evaluation & Scoring Module:** This runs in parallel (or after each question). It might consist of sub-components:

  - **Content Scoring:** Algorithms or models that score the content of an answer. For instance, keyword matching to model answers, or an AI model that gives a score 1-5 for “communication” based on the answer text. For coding, it includes the code testing engine and code analysis results. Likely this module accumulates scores as the interview progresses. It may only finalize once the interview is over (to consider relative performance, etc.).
  - **Code Execution Service:** If applicable, a sandboxed service (like a container) that compiles/runs the candidate’s code against tests. It returns results to the scoring module.
  - **Behavioral Analysis/Fraud Detection:** As detailed earlier, this monitors the data stream (audio, video if any, response patterns). It may be implemented as listeners or hooks into the dialog (e.g., each time candidate answers, run checks in background). It uses AI models or heuristic rules. If something is flagged, it informs the Dialog Manager (which might alter behavior or mark the interview) and is recorded in the evaluation results.
  - **Interview Record Aggregator:** Towards the end, this module compiles all the data: transcripts, scores per question, overall scores, flags, etc., and formats it into a report object.

- **Data Storage:**

  - **Database:** Likely a SQL database for structured info (candidate info, interview template definitions, scores, etc.). Could be PostgreSQL or similar. Ensure multi-tenant structure (company_id keys etc.).
  - **Object Storage:** For large blobs like audio recordings, possibly store them in cloud storage (S3 or equivalent), and save a reference in DB. Same for any video snippet if used, or code files.
  - **Cache:** Use Redis or similar for fast transient data (like session state, or storing interim results, or rate limiting data).
  - **Analytics DB:** Optionally, a separate data warehouse for analytics (to feed dashboards on usage, training data for models, etc., not directly in the transactional path).

- **Integration Layer:**

  - **API Gateway:** All external API calls (from ATS or others) go through an API layer that authenticates and routes to appropriate service (like interview creation, results retrieval). This could be a REST API service with JSON payloads.
  - **ATS Connectors:** For some ATS, especially cloud ones, we might implement specific connectors or use their webhooks. For example, a small service that listens to Greenhouse webhooks and then calls our internal API to create an interview. Or vice versa for pushing results. This can be modular per ATS for flexibility.
  - **Notification Service:** Handles sending emails or messages (for invites, reminders). Could integrate with an email service (SendGrid, etc.) or SMS gateway for texts. These are triggered by the logic (or by scheduler for reminders).
  - **Admin Tools:** Admin interface might call some internal endpoints for template management, etc.
  - **Security Layer:** Ensures all integration points are secured (API tokens, encryption). Perhaps each company gets an API token or we use OAuth with ATS.

- **Architecture Style:** Lean towards microservices or at least well-separated services. For instance, STT and TTS might be external or separate processes, the core logic service is separate from scoring service so they can scale independently. Use message queues if needed for heavy async tasks (like passing a coding solution to a queue to be graded, while the interview moves on, then results come back a few seconds later).

- **Scalability Considerations:**

  - The stateless parts (speech recognition requests, scoring jobs) can scale horizontally easily.
  - The stateful conversation requires each session’s state to be tracked; could be in memory of the dialog service (with sticky session via WebSocket) or stored in a distributed cache so any server can pick it up if needed.
  - Using container orchestration (Kubernetes) to manage scaling for different services.
  - Use CDNs or edge servers for distributing the static content of front-end and maybe for TTS audio if caching common phrases.

**Security in Architecture:**

- Use an authentication service (for login, token issuance).
- Multi-tenancy: ensure each request is checked against user’s permissions (e.g., recruiter X can only fetch results for company Y).
- Separate environments for dev/test vs production to protect real data.

**System Diagram Narrative:** In _Figure 1_ above, you can see an outline of components:

- The **Candidate** connects and provides **Voice Responses**, which go into the **Speech-to-Text Engine**. The recognized text flows into **NLP Understanding & Analysis** which works with the **Interview Logic & Question Bank** to decide how to respond. Ethan’s spoken output is generated via the **Text-to-Speech Engine** and sent back to the Candidate as **Spoken Questions & Prompts**.
- Simultaneously, the **Evaluation & Scoring Module** is evaluating the content, with inputs from both **NLU** (text of answers) and the **Interview Logic** (which knows what question it was and what ideal answers might be) and possibly from code execution results.
- The **Behavioral Fraud Detection** monitors inputs from STT (for voice cues) and NLU (content patterns) for any anomalies.
- Both the scoring module and fraud detection send their outcomes to the **ATS/HRIS Integration** component (depicted in blue), which aggregates the final report and pushes it to the external systems. Recruiters/HR access the results either through the ATS or directly via this integration layer.
- The **Recruiter/HR** also interfaces with **ATS/HRIS Integration** for the initial setup (like sending interview requests, configuration). For example, when they configure a job’s interview template, that is stored via this layer to the question bank or logic.

This architecture ensures separation of concerns: the conversation handling vs analysis vs integration are distinct, which helps with maintenance and scaling.

## Integration Requirements

Integration capabilities are critical for adoption. We detail how Ethan will integrate with external systems and what is required for those integrations.

**ATS Integration (Detailed):**
We plan to support two modes – **Direct Integration** and **via API/Zapier** etc.

- **Direct (Native) Integration:** For popular ATS, build connectors:

  - e.g., Greenhouse: Provide a Harvest API integration where Ethan appears as an “Interview stage”. The recruiter can select Ethan as the interviewer for a stage, and when they move a candidate to that stage, our system gets a webhook or polls and then invites the candidate. After completion, we send back a structured score via Greenhouse’s API to attach to the candidate’s profile (likely as a score or as a PDF report attachment). This requires following Greenhouse’s integration guidelines and getting certified/approved by them.
  - Similar for Lever, Workable, Taleo (some older ones might not have great APIs, but at least provide file outputs). Workday might require a more custom approach (maybe using middleware since Workday’s API is complex). We might partner with integration services if needed.
  - Provide a UI in ATS if possible: Some ATS allow embedding a custom UI via iFrame or link. Could embed a link “View detailed AI Interview report” that opens Ethan’s report page for that candidate (with SSO).

- **Generic API Integration:** Offer a well-documented REST API where:

  - `POST /interviews` with candidate info and template -> returns an interview link or triggers email.
  - `GET /results/{candidate}` -> returns JSON of results or a PDF link after completion.
  - Webhook callbacks as mentioned to notify when done.
    This allows any system (or even custom scripts) to integrate if a native one isn’t available. For example, a company’s custom hiring portal can call our API to schedule interviews.

- **Integration Customization:** Some enterprise workflows might be unique; we should allow toggling certain integration behaviors: e.g., whether invites are sent by Ethan or by the company’s ATS (some might prefer to send the email themselves with our link). So, configuration flags per client integration.
- **Calendar Integration:** If using scheduling, integrate with calendars:

  - Possibly use an API like Google Calendar API or Outlook Office365 API if we were offering timeslots reservation. But since we lean on on-demand, this may not be priority. If scheduled, maybe just block the recruiter’s calendar or more importantly, ensure someone is available for support at that time (but since AI runs it, availability is 24/7).
  - If a candidate needs to schedule a follow-up with a human, that might be triggered from Ethan results – integration to Calendly or similar could be helpful (but that’s post-interview).

- **HRIS/Onboarding Integration:** Not directly needed for interviews, but if a client wants to export interview data to an HRIS for record-keeping, provide a way (maybe just the API or a data export tool).
- **Data Integration for Analytics:** Large companies might want raw data to feed into their data warehouse. We should provide either data export or direct connectors (could be as simple as giving them S3 access to their interview logs or an API to fetch all results). Possibly a partnership with BI tools or making sure our data schema is clear so they can ingest it.
- **Integration Testing:** Provide sandbox environment and test instances for integration partners to validate the flow. E.g., an ATS vendor might test that our webhook responds correctly.
- **Webhooks (again):** We’ll document available webhooks:

  - `interview.started`, `interview.completed`, `interview.failed` (with reasons if any).
  - This allows, for instance, a custom recruiting system to listen and then update their UI or send notifications.

- **API Security:** Each client integration will have unique API keys or OAuth credentials. Possibly implement OAuth 2.0 for companies to authorize Ethan to their ATS data (like how you connect an app to your ATS). Ensure tokens are stored securely and scopes limited.
- **Partnerships:** We might plan to get listed on marketplaces (Greenhouse’s, etc.) which usually means meeting their requirements (some require specific data handling or logging).
- **Integration Fail-safes:** If an integration fails (e.g., ATS down, or API call fails), the system should retry and also log an alert for our support. We don’t want interviews completed but not recorded in ATS. Possibly have a reconciliation job that checks if any completed interviews haven’t been marked in ATS and attempt again.
- **In-product Integration UI:** In Ethan’s admin interface, allow the client to configure their integrations (enter API keys, select which ATS, map job roles to interview templates if needed, etc.). This should be user-friendly enough so implementation isn’t all manual.
- **Other Integrations:**

  - Slack/Teams as mentioned: possibly a small integration to send notifications about interviews to a channel (some recruiters might like that).
  - Recruiting CRMs: some have pre-application chatbots etc. Perhaps allow linking from those to an Ethan interview for a quick screen.
  - **Single Sign-On:** Integration with identity providers (Okta, Azure AD) for our dashboard authentication is also key for enterprise and was mentioned earlier under security.

- **Hardware/Telephony Integration:** If needed, integrate with a telephony API (Twilio etc.) so that candidates could alternatively do the interview via a phone call (especially if they don’t have good internet). The architecture could call a PSTN number, use text-to-speech and speech-to-text via phone. This is a nice-to-have for inclusion. If done, that’s another integration component.
- **Integration Documentation:** Provide comprehensive docs and maybe sample code for using our API and webhooks. Possibly build a developer portal for this.

## Performance and Scalability Considerations

We have touched on this in non-functional, but here we consolidate key considerations and how we plan to meet them, possibly with metrics and tools:

- **Load Testing & Benchmark Metrics:** Before launch, define KPIs like: support 500 concurrent interviews with average response latency < 3s and no more than 1% session failure. Use tools (like JMeter, Locust, or custom harness) to simulate audio streams and user actions. This will help fine-tune the system. We may simulate various conditions (long interviews, many short interviews in burst, etc.).
- **Auto-Scaling:** Implement auto-scaling rules in our deployment environment. E.g., if CPU usage on NLP service > 70% for 5 minutes, scale out another instance. Similarly for STT if we manage our own. If using cloud STT with request limits, ensure quotas are high enough or have multiple keys to distribute load.
- **Caching of Expensive Operations:** For example, if the same question’s TTS is used often (like "Tell me about yourself"), we could cache that audio to not regenerate every time. But since every voice output might be somewhat unique, maybe caching is more for static system messages.
- **Database Scaling:** Ensure the database can handle spikes (mainly writes of transcripts etc.). Use connection pooling. For read-heavy scenarios (like analytic queries), consider read replicas. Partition data by tenant if needed to isolate heavy users.
- **Content Delivery:** Use CDN for static assets (JS/CSS of UI, any images, potentially pre-recorded audio instructions). For streaming, perhaps use WebRTC or WebSocket which is direct.
- **Memory Management:** The AI models can be memory heavy. We might load them once per process. Use techniques like model quantization to reduce size if possible for production. Monitor memory to avoid OOM crashes under load.
- **Graceful Degradation under Overload:** If, despite scaling, the system is overloaded, it should degrade gracefully. For instance, maybe switch to a simpler (faster) speech recognition model temporarily (with slightly lower accuracy) rather than dropping sessions. Or lengthen the response gap with a polite “give me a moment” message to buy time rather than failing.
- **CDN/Edge for latency:** For global scaling, deploy in multi-region. Also, if possible, put an edge server for audio. For example, use a TURN server for WebRTC located near user to relay audio efficiently. TTS might be served from region nearest user (some cloud TTS allow specifying region).
- **Backup Systems:** If one cloud provider service fails (like Google STT outage), have a fallback (maybe switch to Azure STT). This redundancy ensures performance continuity.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Set up real-time monitoring dashboards (like Grafana with Prometheus) to watch metrics. Alert on high latency, error rates, or any queue backups. This way, the engineering team can react quickly to any performance degradation.
- **Client-Side Performance Logging:** Possibly instrument the client to send performance logs (like how long did audio take to play, how network was) to detect if any users consistently have issues – could reveal issues like region not covered well or something.
- **Scalability Roadmap:** Plan capacity ahead of need. If we plan to onboard a customer who will run 10k interviews in a week, do a special scale test for that scenario. Possibly use container clusters that can scale to that with headroom.
- **Stress Scenarios:** Also test worst-case scenarios, e.g., extremely long answer (some candidate talks 10 minutes straight), or someone tries to break system by speaking nonsense continuously. The system should handle lengthy input (maybe chunk it internally) and not crash. Also ensure memory not accumulating (e.g., if we store conversation context, maybe limit it).
- **Batch Processes:** Things like model retraining or large report generation (if any) should run on separate queues so as not to hog the interactive system resources.
- **Concurrent Editing:** If multiple recruiters use the system at same time (like editing templates), ensure no performance issues on admin side (which is minor load anyway).
- **Vertical Scaling Limitations:** Recognize if any component doesn’t scale horizontally easily (like stateful ones). If found, plan to refactor or manage (like sticky sessions or sharding by user). This is an ongoing consideration for ensuring we can grow.

In summary, performance and scalability have been ingrained in each design choice, and we will continuously test and optimize to maintain a smooth experience at scale.

## Security and Compliance Features

Security and compliance are paramount in an HR application dealing with sensitive candidate data and potentially life-changing hiring decisions. Here we list specific features and measures:

### Data Security Features

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All network traffic is encrypted (HTTPS/WSS with TLS 1.2+). There will be no non-HTTPS access. If using WebRTC for audio, that’s encrypted via DTLS/SRTP.
- **Encrypted Storage:** As mentioned, use strong encryption for data at rest. If using cloud services, use their encryption (KMS-managed keys). For recordings stored in S3, for instance, enforce bucket encryption. The database should encrypt data at rest as well (most managed DBs do).
- **Key Management:** Encryption keys for any custom encryption are stored in a secure vault (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault) and rotated per policy. Access to keys is limited to the app processes that need them.
- **User Authentication & Session Security:**

  - Recruiter dashboard will have secure session management (httpOnly cookies or JWTs with short expiry and refresh tokens).
  - Brute force protection on login (lockout after X failed attempts, etc.).
  - 2FA optional for recruiters (or enforced by SSO).
  - For candidates, the interview link is unique and secret; optionally require them to verify identity (perhaps by login or a token SMS) before starting to ensure the right person.

- **Authorization:** Implement fine-grained access control on the backend. Confirm the user’s company and role for each request. E.g., even if a candidate somehow tries to fetch someone else’s result by modifying an ID, the request would be denied due to tenant ID mismatch.
- **Penetration Testing:** We will engage third-party security experts to pen-test the application, especially before going live with large customers. Findings will be addressed, and this will be done annually at least.
- **Secure Configuration:** Ensure servers have hardened configurations:

  - Only necessary ports open.
  - Use latest security patches on OS and dependencies.
  - Use security headers in web responses (CSP, HSTS, XSS Protection, etc.).
  - WAF (Web Application Firewall) might be used to block common attacks.

- **Data Retention & Deletion:** Provide features to automatically delete candidate data after a retention period (say 2 years, configurable per client). Also, an admin can delete an individual’s data upon request (GDPR right to be forgotten). The system should truly erase or anonymize that data (including backups at next cycle).
- **Audit Logs:** Keep logs of sensitive actions (someone viewing a report, exporting data, deleting data, etc.). These logs should be tamper-evident. Possibly store them separate from main DB to avoid someone with DB access editing them.
- **Permissions for Recruiters:** Within a company, allow role-based permissions: e.g., an interviewer can view results but only admins can change templates or integration settings. This prevents a rogue or low-level user from messing up configurations or viewing data they shouldn’t.
- **Server Security:** If self-hosting servers, ensure firewall rules, limited SSH access (if any), and use container security best practices (no running as root, etc.). If using cloud-managed, still follow best practices (restrict IAM roles).
- **Incident Response Plan:** As part of features, have monitoring that can detect unusual access patterns (like if someone’s account is accessed from unusual location, or large data export performed) and flag it. Also, procedures if a breach is detected (e.g., ability to invalidate all sessions, rotate keys quickly).
- **Candidate Privacy Control:** If providing feedback to candidates, ensure it doesn’t inadvertently leak info about others or the model. Also provide a privacy notice to candidates (perhaps on the interview intro page) explaining data usage, and a way to request their data.
- **Third-Party Risks:** Audit any third-party component we integrate (like STT providers) for their security. Make sure data sent to them is protected and that we have agreements (for example, with cloud providers to not store voice data longer than needed). Possibly give clients option to choose provider or on-prem if they are concerned (some might not want audio leaving to Google’s cloud for example; in that case, a local model might be required).

### Compliance Features

- **Audit Reports:** The system can generate an “Interview audit report” that shows that each candidate was asked the same structured questions (for a given role) and scored objectively. This can be used to demonstrate fairness if audited by regulators. It might include the distribution of scores and a statement on how the AI was validated for bias.
- **Bias Testing:** Internally, but could be offered as a feature, run periodic bias tests on the AI models. For example, create synthetic or use real (consented) data to see if certain names or voices lead to different scores unjustified. Ensure that the model doesn’t pick up on irrelevant attributes. We might not expose this fully to customers, but we might publish an annual bias audit summary (some AI hiring companies do this to build trust).
- **Consent and Acknowledgment:** Provide to the client templates for notifying candidates (some jurisdictions require telling candidates that AI will analyze them and they can request alternative). The product should allow the client to customize the invite email to include such disclaimers.
- **Record Keeping:** For compliance, maintain records of interviews and decisions for a certain time (e.g., in the US, require keeping hiring records for 1 year or more). Our retention settings should default to at least that minimum unless client requests deletion.
- **Equal Opportunity Statements:** Possibly integrate an EEO survey in the process (some companies collect demographic info separately; we might not do that ourselves, but allow linking to their survey). At least, ensure nothing in the process could be seen as violating EEO guidelines.
- **Quality and Validity:** From an I/O psychology perspective, we might document that our interview is a valid assessment of candidates, akin to how one would document any pre-employment test. This might not be a software feature, more of documentation and maybe an option for customers to configure the interview to ensure validity (like aligning questions to job analysis).
- **Regulatory Adaptability:** If new laws appear (like requiring an explainability statement to candidates of how they were graded by AI), the system should have the capability to provide that. For instance, generate a candidate-facing explanation report on request: “Our AI rated your problem-solving as 8/10 based on completeness and efficiency of your solutions.” This might become necessary if mandated.
- **Sustainability/Usage Reporting:** Some large companies have compliance around sustainability or data usage. While not typical, if needed we could report on resources (like compute usage, etc.). Mention if we use carbon-intensive processes or offset them. (This is more corporate responsibility but can be a consideration to stand out).
- **Legal Agreements & Certifications:**

  - Provide data processing agreements (DPAs) for clients to sign (we commit to GDPR compliance).
  - Get certified for EU-U.S. data transfer frameworks if needed or host EU data in EU to avoid that issue.
  - Accessibility certification for the interface (if working with government or universities, they often need VPAT for accessibility).

**Security Diagram (conceptual):** While not included visually here, one can imagine a diagram overlaying the architecture with security measures: e.g., firewall icons, lock icons on storage, user roles. The earlier architecture fig. shows ATS integration which implies where data flows out; all those points are secured as described.

In summary, Ethan’s platform is built with a security-first mindset and compliance readiness, which is non-negotiable given the sensitive nature of recruitment and the novelty of AI in this space which will draw scrutiny.

## Roadmap and Milestone Planning

Implementing Ethan with all these capabilities is a substantial undertaking. We outline a phased roadmap with key milestones, balancing delivering a viable product early with gradually adding advanced features:

**Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) – Target Q3 2025**
Focus: Core interview functionality for a specific use-case (e.g., software developer screening interviews), basic integration, and initial model.

- _Features:_

  - Voice Q\&A with natural conversation for basic behavioral and technical questions.
  - Coding challenge support with code execution for one language (say Python initially).
  - Basic scoring (correctness of answers, simple rubric scoring for behavioral using keywords).
  - UI for candidates and simple recruiter dashboard showing transcript and scores.
  - Integration: Manual invite via dashboard + a simple API for invites; one ATS integration (e.g., Greenhouse) as a pilot.
  - Basic cheating measures: plagiarism check on code, basic voice anomaly flag (e.g., detects multiple speakers).
  - Empathy baseline: Friendly voice persona but maybe limited adaptive follow-ups (some scripted follow-ups).

- _Milestones:_

  - **M1:** Prototype complete – End-to-end interview with voice working locally (by end of Q1 2025).
  - **M2:** Alpha test with internal users – a few interviews run and evaluated, gather feedback (Q2 2025).
  - **M3:** Beta release with one or two design partner companies – get real candidate data, refine (late Q2 2025).
  - **MVP Launch:** Soft launch to more customers (Q3 2025). Criteria: System can handle \~50 concurrent interviews, has >90% STT accuracy on test, and partner feedback indicates improvement over traditional screening.

**Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality & Scaling – Q4 2025**
Focus: Expand feature set, improve models, and support more roles/formats.

- _Features:_

  - Add business case interview format fully (with data sharing and multi-turn case handling).
  - Expand coding to multiple languages (Java, C++ etc.) and add more question types (e.g., debugging tasks).
  - Advanced dialog improvements: more adaptive questioning (possibly incorporate an LLM for follow-ups).
  - Cheating detection 2.0: incorporate camera proctoring option, anomaly detection model as described.
  - Integration: add 2-3 more ATS connectors (e.g., Workday, Lever) and calendar scheduling option.
  - UI: richer recruiter dashboard with comparison of candidates, ability to configure templates in UI.
  - Model improvements: Fine-tune the NLP scoring with data from phase 1 (targeting better alignment with human ratings).
  - Multi-language: perhaps add one non-English language support as a test (e.g., Spanish interviewing).
  - Security: complete a third-party security audit and address any issues for enterprise readiness.

- _Milestones:_

  - **M4:** Complete ATS integrations (Greenhouse done in MVP, now e.g., Workday, Lever by mid Q4).
  - **M5:** Full cheating detection suite implemented and tested (Q4).
  - **M6:** Capacity scaled – can handle 200 concurrent interviews in a load test by end of year.
  - **Phase 2 Launch:** Official “Version 1.0” release (perhaps branding it) by end of 2025, marketed as supporting diverse interview types and enterprise scale. Possibly coincide with a major HR tech conference launch.

**Phase 3: Optimization and Enterprise Features – Q1/Q2 2026**
Focus: Refine and optimize, tackle enterprise needs (compliance, customization).

- _Features:_

  - Introduce full customization studio for interviews (template builder with library).
  - Enterprise admin controls (user management in platform, SSO integration general availability).
  - Performance tuning to reduce latency (e.g., deploy more efficient model versions, streamlining pipeline).
  - Add more languages/country support as demand dictates.
  - In-depth analytics for HR: e.g., yield ratios, bias audit dashboard for the client.
  - Feedback to candidates feature (rolled out carefully, maybe as pilot with some clients).
  - Achieve some certifications (SOC 2 Type II likely by this time as we’ll have 6-12 months of operations data, necessary for enterprise sales).

- _Milestones:_

  - **M7:** Template builder GA (General Availability) – by Q1 2026.
  - **M8:** SOC2 audit completed successfully (Q1/Q2 2026).
  - **M9:** >=5 languages supported, covering major client needs (Q2 2026).
  - **Scale milestone:** Achieve stable support for 500+ concurrent interviews, and one big client using it for 10k interviews/month by mid-2026.

**Phase 4: Continuous Improvement and Innovation – Late 2026 and beyond**
Focus: Stay ahead with AI advancements and broaden use.

- Potential items:

  - Use the accumulated data to create predictive analytics: e.g., correlate interview scores with eventual job performance to fine-tune scoring. Possibly create a “success prediction” metric.
  - Introduce a **mock interview practice platform** for candidates (maybe a spin-off offering using similar tech, as ParrotPrep does) – could be part of CSR or a separate product line.
  - Explore integration of AR/VR for roles that need it: e.g., an AR simulation where candidate interacts with a VR scenario and Ethan evaluates (far-future idea).
  - Keep improving conversation naturalness: possibly achieve near-human indistinguishability in voice interviews by fine-tuning voice synthesis and dialogue.
  - Expand cheating measures as needed (e.g., if AI answering tools get more sophisticated, our detection evolves).
  - By this phase, aim for Ethan to be a proven system with possibly hundreds of clients and a track record of improved hiring outcomes (reduce turnover, etc. to measure).

We’ll maintain a detailed **product backlog** that prioritizes features per phase, and we’ll remain agile to adapt priorities based on user feedback. For example, if early users find the empathy not good enough, we might prioritize improvements in Phase 2 sooner. The roadmap above is a guiding plan and will be revisited each quarter.

Visualizing the roadmap (perhaps as a Gantt chart or timeline with major releases) could be done in an appendix if needed, but the above gives the narrative.

## Acceptance Criteria and KPIs

For each major requirement, we define acceptance criteria (conditions to be met for the feature to be considered successfully implemented). We also define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will measure the product’s success and impact post-launch.

**Functional Feature Acceptance Criteria:**

- _Conversational AI Interaction:_

  - AC: In user testing, 80%+ of test participants rate the AI’s voice and flow as natural and easy to interact with.
  - AC: The AI can handle at least 95% of interactions without misunderstanding (i.e., manual observation of transcripts shows minimal incorrect parsing of candidate intent for clear answers).
  - KPI: Conversation overlap or interruption incidents < 5% (i.e., rarely do we talk over the candidate or vice versa awkwardly).

- _Deep Skill Assessment:_

  - AC: The system generates a report for each candidate that includes at least 3 insightful observations beyond numerical scores (checked by product team for meaningfulness).
  - AC: When compared to human interviewer evaluations on a sample of 20 candidates, the AI’s identification of top and bottom performers aligns at least 90% (i.e., if humans say these 5 are best, AI also has those 5 as top scorers, etc.).
  - KPI: Reduction in candidates going to next round who perform poorly (indicator that screening is effective) – e.g., measure that <10% of those Ethan recommends “reject” but humans advanced later pass the next round, implying AI was right.

- _Diverse Format Support:_

  - AC: Successfully conduct interviews in all three format types (coding, case, ML deep-dive) during beta with positive recruiter feedback that the content was relevant.
  - AC: The coding interview environment supports at least 3 languages and runs typical problems under 1 second for test feedback.
  - KPI: Percentage of roles/teams in pilot company using Ethan – target > 50% by volume (shows versatility; e.g., not just engineering but also product, sales, etc., indicating multiple formats in use).

- _Real-World Skills Emphasis:_

  - AC: All default questions in the system are reviewed and approved by domain experts as relevant to the role (no puzzle questions unless justified).
  - AC: In follow-up surveys, 90% of candidates agree “the interview questions were relevant to the job applied for” (question in candidate survey).
  - KPI: Hiring manager satisfaction with new hires (tracked by internal metrics or surveys) improves by X% after implementing Ethan – indicating better quality screening.

- _Cheating Detection:_

  - AC: During testing, plant at least 5 cheating scenarios (e.g., candidate uses ChatGPT to answer coding, candidate has someone whisper answers) – Ethan should flag >= 4 of them.
  - AC: System generates an integrity score or flag for each interview, and in simulation no false flags for honest candidates in a sample of 20 (fine-tune tolerance to minimize false positives).
  - KPI: Incidents of confirmed cheating slipping through undetected – target < 2% of interviews. Also, time saved in not having to re-interview or disqualify late in process due to cheating, anecdotally tracked.

- _Candidate Satisfaction:_

  - AC: Candidate satisfaction (via post-interview survey) average rating ≥ 4 out of 5 in beta.
  - AC: At least 85% of candidates say they would be willing to do an AI interview again.
  - KPI: Candidate drop-off rate (those who are invited but do not complete the interview) < 15%. If this is low, it indicates the process is not scaring candidates away.
  - KPI: Candidate NPS (Net Promoter Score) for the interview process – aim for positive (e.g., +20 or more).

- _Empathy & Human-likeness:_

  - AC: In A/B tests, empathic voice version vs monotone version, the empathic version yields higher candidate satisfaction (statistically significant). So we accept if empathy improvements correlate with satisfaction.
  - KPI: Usage of “repeat” or “clarify” functions by candidates – should be low (< 5% questions) if the AI is clear and understanding; higher might indicate confusion.

- _Detailed Assessments:_

  - AC: Every report includes competency scores and textual feedback – check completeness.
  - AC: Recruiters in pilot report that the AI feedback was useful in 90% of cases (survey or interviews with them).
  - KPI: Reduction in average time recruiters spend per candidate. If pre-Ethan they spent 30 min phone screen each, now ideally 5-10 min just reviewing reports. Could measure by asking recruiters or by how many candidates one recruiter can handle.

- _Technical Interview Capability (emerging tech):_

  - AC: If a client uses it for an AR/VR role and provides some domain questions, Ethan can conduct without issues – basically ensure system can load new content easily.
  - KPI: Number of distinct job families successfully using Ethan (target e.g., 10 different ones by end of year).

- _Customization:_

  - AC: A recruiter can create a custom interview template through the UI without dev intervention and use it – tested with a sample custom template.
  - AC: Custom questions can be added and the AI asks them appropriately in test runs.
  - KPI: Percentage of interview content that clients customize (if it’s low it might mean our templates suffice or they aren’t using it; if high, means feature is used – both could be fine, but if none use customization maybe it’s too hard or not needed).

- _Integration:_

  - AC: Integrations with at least 2 ATS are working in production (in pilot, verify end-to-end: move candidate in ATS -> interview happens -> results back in ATS).
  - AC: API response times for integrations < 2 seconds for any call.
  - KPI: Proportion of interviews triggered via integration vs manually – want > 80% via integration for efficiency (meaning clients aren’t having to manually invite outside ATS).

- _Scalability:_

  - AC: System passes load test of 200 concurrent interviews of 15 min each, with average response latency < 3s and no significant errors or crashes.
  - AC: Monitoring in place triggers no high-severity alert under expected load in first month (meaning we didn’t hit capacity unexpectedly).
  - KPI: Uptime >= 99.5% as measured per quarter.
  - KPI: Response latency p95 < 5s at peak loads.

- _Pricing Transparency:_

  - AC: Clients can access a usage dashboard that updates at least daily. Verified with test billing data that counts match.
  - AC: Billing system generates correct invoices for a test client with complex usage (mix of interviews, plan changes).
  - KPI: No billing disputes from clients due to confusion or mistakes (aim for zero; any that occur, fix quickly).

- _Continuous Model Improvement:_

  - AC: Have retrained the NLP/Scoring model at least once with new data and saw measurable improvement (e.g., accuracy of answer grading improved from X to Y on validation set).
  - AC: Bias checks on new model show no regression in fairness metrics.
  - KPI: Model accuracy (agreement with human labels) improves quarter over quarter until it plateaus at a high level (\~90%+ agreement for structured questions).
  - KPI: Volume of data collected and used for training – not exactly a success metric, but if by Q4 we have, say, 1000 interviews and we used them to update model, that’s progress.

**Product Success KPIs (overall):**

- **Time to Hire Reduction:** Measure at pilot companies – their average time from application to offer should decrease. Aim for something like 20-30% reduction by cutting out scheduling delays and quick screening.
- **Efficiency Gain:** Each recruiter can handle more candidates. KPI: Candidates screened per recruiter per week. If previously one could do 10 phone screens/day, with Ethan they could initiate 50+ interviews/day (since AI does them) and just review results. Perhaps a 3-5x increase.
- **Quality of Hire:** Harder to measure immediately, but maybe the 90-day turnover or performance of new hires improves compared to previous cohorts. We may not have data in short term, but long term KPI: reduce early-stage turnover by X% (some AI hiring claims e.g. 89% reduction in turnover for one case – though that may be very context-specific).
- **Adoption and Expansion:** Number of interviews run via Ethan per month; target growing this consistently. Client retention and expansion (e.g., starting with one department, expanding to company-wide after seeing success – measure how many pilots convert to full rollouts).
- **User Satisfaction (Recruiters/Hiring Managers):** NPS or CSAT from the client side. If recruiters find it helpful, they might say “I trust the AI’s recommendations” – we can survey that. Aim for high satisfaction that it’s making their job easier, not harder.
- **Compliance Incidents:** Ideally zero issues (no legal challenges or negative PR about bias). This is more of a risk metric – any serious compliance failure would be a huge hit. So success is absence of such incidents and possibly external validation (maybe an independent audit or even an award for fair AI in hiring).
- **System Health:** Uptime, no major outages especially during critical usage. If an outage happens and interviews are missed, that’s a serious issue. So count of high-severity incidents should be extremely low.

Each of these KPIs will be tracked via analytics in the system or through customer feedback loops. The product team will review them regularly to adjust priorities.

## Appendices

_(The appendices provide additional supporting information such as mockups, glossary of terms, and technical specifications for reference.)_

### Appendix A: Sample Screens and Mockups

_Due to the medium, we describe the mockups._ For illustration, here are descriptions of key screens:

- **Candidate Interview Screen Mockup:** A clean interface with minimal distractions. Top shows a greeting or company logo. Center has an indicator that Ethan is speaking or listening. For example, when Ethan speaks, a text caption might appear (“Tell me about a challenge you overcame…”) along with a subtle avatar or waveform animation. When listening, it might display “Listening…” and maybe a waveform of the candidate’s voice input to reassure it’s hearing them. A side panel could show the question text and any relevant info (like a code editor if in coding section, or a case study data table). There’s a mute/unmute button and maybe an option to type if having mic issues. At bottom perhaps a progress indicator (e.g., question 3 of 5, or time elapsed). The color scheme is friendly and neutral. Overall, the candidate should feel like they are on a simple call or voice chat with a visual aid.

- **Recruiter Dashboard Mockup:** The main view might be a table of candidates. Columns like Candidate Name, Role, Interview Status (Completed/Pending), Score, Flags (if any). They can click a candidate to open the **Interview Report**. The report page would show:

  - Summary at top (Recommendation: e.g., “Proceed” in green, Score 85, Date of interview).
  - Sectioned view: perhaps tabs or accordion for each competency or question. E.g., “Coding Challenge” – shows the code they wrote, result of tests, AI comments on it. “Behavioral Questions” – shows each Q, the candidate’s transcribed answer (maybe with ability to play audio), and AI’s analysis (key points, score).
  - Flags highlighted in red if present (e.g., “Integrity Flag: Possible plagiarism detected” with explanation).
  - A sidebar with candidate info and actions (like button to advance to next round in ATS or to download report as PDF).
  - Also an overview graph or meter for each skill.
  - Possibly a comparison feature: if viewing multiple candidates, show how this candidate ranks. But that might be later enhancement.

- **Template Builder Mockup:** An interface where the recruiter can drag and drop question blocks. For example, a left panel lists question types: “Ask a Coding Question”, “Ask a Behavioral Question”, “Ask a Custom Question”. They drag “Behavioral” into the sequence and then choose from library or write their own. They can reorder by dragging. They can set properties (time limit, whether mandatory). It might look similar to survey or form builders out there. At the end, they save it as “Software Engineer Phone Screen Template”.

_(If this were a delivered document to stakeholders, actual images or wireframes would be included, but here we provide descriptions due to text format.)_

### Appendix B: Glossary

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** In this context, refers to the algorithms and models enabling Ethan’s human-like interviewing and evaluation capabilities. Includes machine learning models for language understanding, speech recognition, etc.
- **NLU (Natural Language Understanding):** The component of AI that comprehends human language input (the candidate’s answers) – parsing meaning, intent, sentiment.
- **STT (Speech-to-Text):** Speech recognition technology that converts spoken audio into textual transcripts.
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech):** Synthesizes spoken audio from text, allowing Ethan to “speak” questions in a natural voice.
- **ATS (Applicant Tracking System):** Software used by recruiters to track candidates through hiring stages (e.g., Workday, Greenhouse). Integration means Ethan connects with these systems.
- **HRIS (Human Resources Information System):** Broader term for HR software managing employee data; mentioned in context of integration if needed.
- **Behavioral Question:** An interview question about past behavior (e.g., “Tell me about a time…”), used to gauge competencies like leadership or teamwork.
- **Case Study Interview:** A format typically used in consulting/business roles where candidate must analyze a business scenario or problem.
- **Coding Challenge:** A technical test where candidate writes code to solve a problem.
- **Competency:** A skill or attribute (technical knowledge, communication, problem-solving, etc.) that interviews aim to assess.
- **Bias (AI Bias):** Systematic error in AI that could favor or disfavor certain groups inappropriately. We aim to minimize bias to be fair (see Compliance).
- **EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity):** Laws/regulations ensuring non-discriminatory hiring. Relevant to how Ethan must operate fairly.
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** EU law on data privacy, requiring consent, right to delete data, etc.
- **SOC 2:** A security compliance standard for SaaS companies. Type II means controls are effective over time.
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score):** A measure of user satisfaction/loyalty, derived from asking how likely one is to recommend the service.
- **Latency:** Delay between an input and response in the system (important for conversation fluidity).
- **Concurrent Interviews:** Number of interviews happening at the same exact time – used for capacity planning.
- **Plagiarism Detection:** Checking if code or answers match known content (which would imply copying).
- **Anomaly Detection:** In context, identifying out-of-the-ordinary patterns that could indicate cheating or other issues.
- **WebSocket:** A communication protocol ideal for real-time bi-directional communication (used for streaming audio).
- **Microservices:** Architectural style of building the software as small, independent services (like separate services for STT, scoring, etc.).
- **Cluster:** Group of servers/computers working together (like in cloud) to handle load.
- **Load Test:** Testing with simulated heavy usage to ensure system can handle expected loads.
- **Persona:** A fictional archetype of a user (we used Recruiter Persona, Candidate Persona for design).
- **UI/UX:** User Interface / User Experience, referring to design of the product’s screens and interactions.
- **I/O Psychology:** Industrial/Organizational Psychology, field that includes studying and validating employee selection methods (relevant for ensuring Ethan’s interview approach is valid).
- **LLM (Large Language Model):** A type of AI model (like GPT) that could be used for generating or understanding text in a human-like way.

### Appendix C: Technical Specifications

This section provides some low-level or specific technical details that may be of interest to implementation teams or for transparency:

- **Supported Programming Languages for Coding Interviews:** Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, C++, Ruby (initially; can extend to others based on demand). Each runs in a sandboxed Docker container with resource limits (e.g., 2 CPU, 1GB RAM per run) and a timeout (e.g., 5 seconds execution limit) to prevent abuse or infinite loops.
- **Speech Recognition Engine Specs:** Using (for example) Google Cloud Speech-to-Text with enhanced phone call model for English, configured to automatically add punctuation. Accuracy \~95% for native speakers, \~85-90% for non-native (to be improved with adaptation). Real-time streaming with a 300ms average lag. Considering on-prem Kaldi model for long-term to reduce cost at volume.
- **Text-to-Speech Voice:** Using Amazon Polly neural voice “Matthew” for Ethan’s voice (or similar voice). This voice has an average speech rate of \~150 words/minute. It supports Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), which we use to add appropriate pauses and intonation for empathy.
- **Language Understanding Model:** A fine-tuned BERT-based model (or GPT-3.5 via API initially) used to classify and summarize answers. For example, a BERT model fine-tuned on behavioral answers to classify which competency the answer demonstrates (score 0-1 scale).
- **Infrastructure:** Deployed on AWS (for instance). Using Kubernetes (EKS) for container orchestration. Each microservice (STT interface, dialog manager, scoring service, etc.) runs in its own container and scales horizontally. Using Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database (Multi-AZ for resilience). S3 for storing recordings and logs. CloudFront CDN for static content.
- **Network and Deployment:** All services within a VPC. Only public endpoints are the Web app (served via CloudFront) and API gateway (which then proxies to internal services). Using ALB (Application Load Balancer) with WAF for security on API.
- **Third-Party Components:**

  - _Voice Engines:_ Google STT, Amazon Polly as mentioned (subject to change if we develop in-house).
  - _Coding judge:_ Possibly using an open-source runner or a service like HackerRank’s API if available, but likely we implement our own with Docker.
  - _Analytics:_ Integrating with an internal ElasticSearch/ELK stack for log analytics, or using AWS CloudWatch for logs and metrics.

- **Data Volume Expectations:** For 1000 interviews of \~30 minutes, that’s about 500 hours of audio, roughly 5 GB of data (if stored compressed). Transcript text maybe 1 million words (\~10 MB). Our database primarily stores text and numbers, which is manageable. Storage scaling mainly for audio – plan for efficient compression (MP3 or Opus).
- **Backup & Recovery:** Daily automated backups of DB with 35-day retention. Point-in-time recovery enabled. S3 has versioning for critical buckets. Disaster Recovery plan: in worst case, can restore in a different region within <24 hours.
- **Latency Breakdown Example:** (targeted) STT returns interim results within 1 second, final result within 1.5s of speech end; Dialog processing and deciding next question 0.5s; TTS generation 1s for a sentence. Total \~3s. We will measure this and optimize each component if needed (e.g., might pre-fetch next question TTS while candidate is finishing speaking if prediction possible).
- **API Rate Limits:** For API usage (invites, etc.), initial limit like 100 requests/minute per client to prevent abuse (adjustable for enterprise). Websocket also monitored to avoid too high message rate (like if a client malfunction spams audio frames).
- **Concurrent Execution Limits:** A pool of e.g. 50 containers for code execution to run in parallel and queue additional if needed, to throttle heavy usage so system overall stays responsive. (This can scale up with more nodes as needed.)
- **Model Update Process:** e.g., retrain scoring model monthly. This will involve exporting labeled data from DB, training offline (perhaps using AWS SageMaker or on our GPU rig), evaluating, then deploying new model behind a feature flag to test on some traffic before full rollout. Each model has a version ID stored.
- **Compliance Technicals:**

  - Data deletion: a delete job that runs daily to purge any interviews past retention date, wiping associated S3 objects and DB entries.
  - Audit logs stored in append-only storage (maybe an S3 log bucket with limited access).
  - All production access (for debugging) requires VPN and 2FA and is logged.

- **Front-end Tech Stack:** Likely React for web, with Web Audio API and WebRTC for audio streaming. Using perhaps Socket.io or similar for signaling. The code editor in coding question could be integrated (like Monaco editor, used in VSCode, for syntax highlighting).
- **AI Ethics & Fairness Testing Tool:** (internal) we have a script to run the models on a set of hypothetical answers that vary only in some demographic wording (like “I managed a team of 5 men” vs “5 women”) to ensure no differences in scoring. Also using Google’s What-If tool or similar for model bias inspection.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Prometheus for metrics, Grafana dashboards, Sentry for error tracking, and PagerDuty alerts set for critical issues (like system down or high error rates).
- **Extensibility Note:** The system is built API-first, meaning the same APIs used for our UI could be used by clients or partners. This will allow easier creation of mobile apps or integration with other systems in the future.

---

This comprehensive PRD covers Ethan’s envisioned capabilities, requirements, and design considerations in detail. It is intended to guide the product management, design, and development teams in aligning their efforts to build a cutting-edge AI voice interviewing platform that delivers on its promise of expert-level interviewing at scale, deep insights, and a great user experience for both candidates and recruiters.

With this document, we aim for a clear understanding of **“what”** we are building and **“why,”** so the team can confidently proceed to the **“how”** in implementation, knowing the end goals and guardrails. Ethan has the potential to revolutionize hiring processes, and this PRD is the foundational blueprint to realizing that vision.
