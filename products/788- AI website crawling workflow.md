🔍 **Building the Future of Intelligent Document Ingestion & Semantic Search**

Last week, I had the opportunity to walk through our AI-powered website crawling and document indexing system with the team. Here's a quick recap of what we covered and how it’s shaping real-world use cases.

🚀 **Website Crawling in Action**
We explored how our system crawls websites using:

- OpenAI for embeddings
- LangChain’s text splitter for content chunking
- A modular crawling engine that kicks off from a single URL and scales across multiple pages
- Vector store indexing for lightning-fast semantic search

🧠 **System Architecture Overview**
We dove into the architecture:

- A distributed job management system
- Asynchronous crawling & content extraction
- Task orchestration that ensures scalability and fault tolerance

🔄 **Job Processing Workflow**
From job creation to vector indexing:

- Each crawl is tracked by a unique job ID
- Content is split, embedded, indexed, and stored
- Status and progress are transparently managed through task IDs

💡 **Real-World Use Cases**
The versatility of the system unlocks powerful applications:

- 📚 Enterprise knowledge base search
- ⚙️ Technical documentation discovery
- 📑 Compliance and regulatory document management
- 🧪 Research analogy databases
- 🎓 Educational content curation (think ACT, TSAT, engineering topics)

⚙️ **Core Features**

- Asynchronous web crawler
- Semantic processing with OpenAI-compatible LLMs
- FastAPI interface for real-time interaction
- Distributed processing pipeline

🧪 **Experimentation Zone**
We're expanding our architecture using models from DeepSeek and Microsoft alongside OpenAI and LangChain to push the boundaries of LLM performance in search and retrieval.
