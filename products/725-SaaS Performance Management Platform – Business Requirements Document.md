# SaaS Performance Management Platform – Business Requirements Document

## Introduction

&#x20;_Performance management is a continuous cycle of **planning**, **monitoring**, **reviewing**, and **rewarding** employee performance. It aligns individual contributions with organizational goals, fostering higher engagement and productivity._ This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines a comprehensive set of requirements for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) **Performance Management Platform**. The document is tailored for product managers to understand the needed features, functionality, and design considerations for a modern performance management solution. It covers both **functional requirements** (key features and use cases) and **non-functional requirements** (usability, reliability, integration, etc.), with detailed specifications, user stories, and feature-level details.

**Purpose:** The purpose of this BRD is to define the complete scope and functionality of the Performance Management platform. By clearly documenting requirements, we ensure the platform will facilitate effective employee development and align with business objectives. Modern organizations seek to **improve employee performance, engagement, and alignment with company strategy** through continuous feedback and data-driven insights. This document translates those business needs into specific product capabilities.

**Scope:** The scope of the platform includes all aspects of **performance management**, including goal setting and tracking, performance reviews, multi-rater (360-degree) feedback processes, development and career planning, and analytics (reports/dashboards). The platform will support global enterprises with customizable configurations, integration capabilities, and robust security/access controls. Out-of-scope are peripheral HR functions not directly related to performance management (e.g. recruiting, core HRIS personnel records – except where integration is needed).

**Audience:** Primary readers of this document are **Product Management** and **Development Teams** responsible for building the platform. It is also relevant for **HR stakeholders** and **business sponsors** to validate that the system meets organizational performance management needs.

**Structure:** The document is organized into major sections corresponding to functional areas of the system (e.g. Performance Reviews, 360 Feedback, Goal Management, etc.). Each section provides:

- **Overview/Description:** What the feature entails and why it’s needed.
- **Functional Specifications:** Detailed requirements (the system "shall" statements).
- **User Stories & Use Cases:** Illustrative scenarios from end-users’ perspective.
- **Tables/Visual Aids:** Where appropriate, to clarify complex information (e.g. example goal alignment, role permissions matrix, etc.).

By the end of this document, a reader should have a **200-page** level of detail and clarity (conceptually) on how the performance management platform will function, ensuring that nothing is left ambiguous for the implementation teams.

## 1. Employee Performance Reviews

Employee performance reviews are the cornerstone of the performance management process. This feature will support formal **review cycles** (annual, quarterly, etc.) where managers and employees evaluate performance, document feedback, and set new objectives. The system must facilitate the entire **performance appraisal workflow** – from goal-setting at the beginning of the cycle to final performance evaluations and outcomes (ratings, summaries) at the end.

Key capabilities include creating review **forms**, scheduling review cycles, capturing multi-part feedback (self-assessment, manager assessment, etc.), and ensuring timely completion through notifications and tracking.

### 1.1 Description & Workflow

At a high level, the **performance review process** works as follows:

- **Planning:** HR or system administrators configure a review cycle (e.g. “2025 Annual Review”) with a defined timeframe, participants, and form templates. Expectations and goals for the period are set during this phase (often using SMART criteria).
- **Monitoring:** Throughout the period, employees and managers track progress on goals and gather feedback. (This continuous aspect is detailed in section 8 on Performance Tracking.)
- **Review Submission:** When the cycle opens, employees complete a self-review reflecting on their accomplishments and challenges. Managers then complete evaluations for each direct report, providing ratings on competencies/goals and qualitative feedback. Peers or skip-level managers might also contribute if part of the process.
- **Calibration (optional):** Managers and HR can compare and adjust evaluations to ensure consistency (addressing rating biases).
- **Review Meeting:** Manager and employee meet to discuss the evaluation, finalize ratings, and agree on new goals or development plans.
- **Approval & Sign-off:** Higher-level managers or HR may approve the reviews. Employees acknowledge (e-sign) the review, confirming it was discussed.
- **Outcomes:** The finalized review, including overall performance ratings and summaries, is stored in the system. This data feeds into decisions on promotions, compensation adjustments, and development actions (later sections cover these uses).

_Example Workflow – Annual Performance Review:_

1. **Initiate Review Cycle:** HR creates the “Annual Review 2025” in the system, selects eligible employees, attaches the standard review form (including sections for goals, competencies, and overall comments), and sets deadlines for self-reviews and manager reviews.
2. **Self-Assessment:** Jane Doe (Employee) receives a notification that her self-review is available. She logs in, rates her achievement of each goal set for the year, answers questions about her strengths, areas for improvement, and highlights accomplishments. She submits the self-assessment.
3. **Manager Evaluation:** John Smith (Jane’s Manager) gets notified to complete Jane’s review. He sees her self-assessment side-by-side with the review form. He provides ratings for each performance criterion (e.g. a rating from 1-5) and writes comments. The system allows John to save a draft and come back later if needed.
4. **Second-Level Review:** Once John submits, his manager (Director) can be configured to review and approve the evaluation for calibration purposes. The Director can see an overview of John’s team’s ratings to ensure fairness.
5. **Performance Review Meeting:** John schedules a meeting with Jane via the system (which could integrate with calendars). During the meeting, they discuss the review. John finalizes the review in the system, and shares it with Jane for acknowledgement.
6. **Employee Acknowledgement:** Jane acknowledges the review in the system (an electronic signature), perhaps adding final comments.
7. **Completion & Reporting:** The cycle for Jane is marked complete. HR can run a report to see completion status for all employees and analyze the distribution of ratings across the company (for example, how many were rated “Exceeds Expectations”). This data is used for merit increase planning (see section 11) and identifying high performers (see section 7 on Promotions & Succession).

This workflow should be **configurable** to fit different organizational processes (some companies might skip self-reviews or have 360-feedback integrated, etc.). The system should enforce deadlines via automated reminders, and provide a **dashboard for HR** to track progress of the review cycle (e.g. % of forms submitted).

### 1.2 Functional Requirements

- **Review Cycle Management:** The system shall allow administrators to create and manage performance review cycles with specific start/end dates, participant groups, and assigned forms.
- **Template & Form Builder:** The system shall provide a configurable **performance review form** builder. Admins can define sections (goals, competencies, values, overall comments, etc.), rating scales (e.g. 5-point numeric, descriptive labels), and weighted scoring if applicable. Different templates can be used for different levels or departments as needed.
- **Self and Manager Assessments:** The system shall support a self-assessment phase where employees can evaluate themselves against goals/criteria, and a manager assessment phase for the manager’s evaluation. The manager should be able to view the employee’s self-review while completing their own.
- **Multi-Level Reviews:** The system shall support additional review layers (e.g. second-level manager approval or peer reviews) as optional steps. For example, an **alternate reviewer** or **skip-level manager** can be included for approval or comments before finalization.
- **Workflow & Notifications:** The system shall enforce the workflow through automated notifications and reminders. For instance, when self-review opens, employees get an email; once self-review is submitted, the manager gets notified to start; reminder emails (or in-app notifications) are sent before due dates.
- **Editing and Version Control:** The system shall allow saving draft reviews. Managers and employees can return to edit their responses any time before submission. Once submitted, edits are locked or require an “unlock” by an admin to maintain data integrity. The system should timestamp submissions and any changes.
- **Calibration Support:** The system **shall provide comparison tools** during or after the review process to facilitate calibration. For example, HR and leaders can view a **summary of ratings** across a department (average scores, distribution charts) to identify discrepancies. It may allow bulk adjustments or require justification if a rating is changed during calibration.
- **Manager-Employee Sign-Off:** The system shall support an acknowledgment step. After the manager finalizes a review, the employee can sign off electronically to acknowledge the discussion. The date of acknowledgment is stored for record-keeping.
- **Historical Record:** The system shall retain all past performance reviews for each employee, accessible in their profile. Managers and HR can view past reviews to see performance trends over time.
- **Security & Confidentiality:** Performance review content must be restricted to appropriate roles. Typically, an employee sees their own reviews, their manager and HR see their team’s reviews, but peers do not see each other’s reviews. The system shall enforce these access rules (see section 15 on access control).
- **Customization per Business Unit:** The platform shall allow different business units or departments to have tailored review processes. E.g., Sales might have a section for sales targets, whereas Engineering might focus on project delivery. Admins can clone and modify templates per unit.
- **Rating Calculations:** If an overall score is needed, the system shall support calculations (e.g., average of goal scores and competency scores, or a weighted formula). Admins can configure how overall ratings are derived automatically.
- **Attachments & Evidence:** The system shall allow attaching supporting documents or comments to a review. For example, an employee might attach a work sample or a customer feedback letter as evidence of performance.
- **Anonymous Feedback (if needed):** In some cases (like upward feedback on managers), the system shall support anonymity. For instance, if direct reports provide feedback on a manager as part of their review, their identities can be hidden in the final compiled report.
- **Completion Tracking:** The system shall provide HR a dashboard or report to monitor completion status: who has submitted self-reviews, which managers are pending, etc., and send escalations for overdue reviews.

### 1.3 User Stories

- **As an Employee,** I want to complete a self-assessment in my performance review so that I can reflect on my achievements and provide my perspective to my manager.
- **As a Manager,** I want to be notified when my team’s self-reviews are done so that I can write and submit my evaluations on time.
- **As a Manager,** I want to view my employee’s self-review responses alongside the manager evaluation form, so that I can consider their input while writing my feedback.
- **As a Department Head (Reviewer),** I want to see a summary of all my managers’ proposed ratings for their team members, so that I can ensure consistency and fairness before finalizing the reviews.
- **As an HR Administrator,** I want to configure different performance review forms for different job roles, so that evaluations are relevant and tailored (e.g., a sales rep’s review includes sales metrics, an engineer’s includes project delivery).
- **As an HR Administrator,** I need to track the completion of performance reviews company-wide, so that I can follow up with managers who are late and ensure the process completes on schedule.
- **As an Employee,** I want to sign-off on my completed review acknowledging I discussed it with my manager, so that there is a record that I have seen my evaluation.
- **As a Manager,** I want the ability to reopen or adjust a review (with HR permission) if I made an error, so that the record accurately reflects the evaluation discussed.
- **As an Executive,** I want to see an overview of the performance ratings distribution across the company after a review cycle, so I can identify if our talent is mostly meeting, exceeding, or below expectations (this ties into analytics and calibration).

## 2. 360-Degree Feedback

**360-degree feedback** (also known as multi-rater feedback) enables employees to receive confidential, anonymous feedback from a full circle of coworkers – including direct reports, peers, and managers, and sometimes external stakeholders (e.g. customers or partners). This platform must support configuring and running 360-feedback processes to give employees a broader perspective on their performance and behavior.

Unlike the top-down manager review, 360 feedback collects diverse viewpoints to highlight strengths and development areas that a single manager might miss. According to industry definition, _“360-degree feedback is a method of employee performance assessment that gathers input and ratings from multiple stakeholders, including peers, managers, and direct reports”_. Our system will facilitate this by managing feedback surveys and consolidating results.

Typical uses of 360 feedback include leadership development programs, annual reviews for managers, or mid-year developmental feedback for all staff. The platform should handle **nominating raters**, distributing questionnaires, and aggregating the feedback into a useful report for the employee and their manager.

### 2.1 Description & Workflow

A 360-feedback process generally works like this:

- **Initiation:** An HR or team lead launches a 360 feedback cycle for a target population (e.g., all managers, or a specific employee for development). Each participant who will receive feedback (often called the "feedback subject" or "target") either selects a group of raters or has raters assigned. Raters typically include the person’s direct supervisor, a set of peer colleagues, any direct reports (for managers), and possibly oneself (self-rating) and external people if relevant. The system should support **configurable rater categories** (e.g., Self, Manager, Peers, Direct Reports, Others).
- **Rater Selection:** The system can assist in selecting raters. It might allow the subject to nominate peers (with manager approval) or automatically include certain people (e.g., all direct reports). For example, the organization might require 3-5 peers, all direct reports, and the direct manager to participate. The platform should make this selection step easy (suggesting names from the org chart and ensuring a balanced selection).
- **Feedback Form Distribution:** Once raters are set, the system sends each rater a notification to fill out an online feedback form about the subject. The form typically contains questions or rating scales on competencies, behaviors, or skills (for example, leadership ability, communication, teamwork). It often includes open-ended questions for qualitative feedback.
- **Anonymous Input:** Raters (except possibly the direct manager) provide feedback anonymously. The system must ensure that individual responses (especially from peers or subordinates) are not identifiable in the output. This encourages candor. For anonymity, a minimum number of respondents per category might be enforced before showing data (e.g., if only one direct report, their feedback might be hidden or combined with peers to preserve confidentiality).
- **Monitoring & Reminders:** The system tracks who has submitted feedback and sends reminders to those who haven’t by the deadline. HR or the subject’s manager should have a view of response rates (except they should not see who said what – only completion status).
- **Report Compilation:** After the feedback deadline, the system generates a **360 feedback report** for the subject. This report aggregates quantitative ratings (often showing average scores per question or competency, broken down by rater group) and lists verbatim comments (typically mixed or grouped by question, and by rater group without names). The report should highlight strengths and weaknesses – e.g., by showing where the self-rating differed from others’, or which areas scored highest and lowest. Visualizations like bar charts for each competency comparing self vs. others can be very useful.
- **Delivery & Debrief:** The feedback report is delivered to the subject and often their manager or a coach. The platform might allow a facilitator (HR or manager) to add summary comments or development suggestions. The subject and manager then meet to discuss the feedback and incorporate it into a development plan (linking with section 6 on Development Planning).

_Example Use Case – 360 Feedback for a Manager:_

Lisa is a Team Leader who will receive 360 feedback as part of a leadership development program. The HR coordinator initiates the 360 process for Lisa:

1. **Select Raters:** Lisa’s profile is loaded in the system. The default rater groups are: 1 Manager (her boss), 4 Peers (colleagues at her level she works closely with), 5 Direct Reports (her team members), and Self. The system suggests Lisa’s peers based on frequent collaboration (or HR manually selects). Lisa can propose additional peers. Her manager approves the final list of 10 raters.
2. **Distribute Surveys:** Each rater receives a task: “Provide feedback for Lisa Smith’s 360 Review.” They click the link which opens the feedback questionnaire. It has \~20 rating questions across competencies like _Communication, Teamwork, Leadership_ and 3 open-text questions (e.g., “What is one thing Lisa does well? What should she improve?”).
3. **Anonymous Feedback Collection:** Raters submit their responses. The system logs completion. Lisa and her manager can see that, for example, 3/4 peers and 4/5 direct reports have submitted (but not who specifically). Reminder emails automatically go out to the remaining ones near the deadline.
4. **Report Generation:** Once all responses are in (or the deadline passes), the system compiles the data. Lisa’s 360 report shows a chart for each competency with bars for Self vs. Manager vs. Peers vs. Direct Reports ratings. For instance, her _Communication_ average rating from peers is 4.5, from direct reports 4.7, but her self-rating was 4.0 – indicating she underrates herself in communication. Written comments are listed (e.g., under "Strengths": "Lisa communicates project goals clearly \[Peer feedback]"). No comment is attributed to an individual.
5. **Review & Discuss:** Lisa’s manager gets access to the report slightly before Lisa, to prepare to discuss. Then Lisa sees the report in her portal. They schedule a meeting. During the discussion, they note that while peers and reports rate Lisa highly on communication and teamwork, there’s a relative weakness in _delegation_ (one comment: "She sometimes micromanages tasks"). Together, they add a **development action** in the system for Lisa: attend a delegation training and practice assigning responsibility more broadly (this ties to development planning features).
6. **Follow-Up:** The system allows setting a follow-up 360 in a year to measure improvement, or at least tracks that this feedback occurred and links it to Lisa’s profile for future reference.

### 2.2 Functional Requirements

- **360 Process Setup:** The system shall allow HR or managers to initiate a 360-degree feedback process for an individual or a group. They should be able to specify the **subject(s)** of feedback, the rater categories needed (e.g. self, manager, peers, direct reports, external), and the timeline for completion.
- **Rater Selection:** The system shall facilitate selecting and managing raters for each feedback subject. Options should include: the ability for the subject to nominate raters (with a limit per category), the manager to assign raters, or automatic assignment (e.g., include all direct reports as raters for a manager). The system should ensure the required number of raters in each category (e.g., at least 3 peers) and prevent conflicts (e.g., not allow an employee to choose only friends who might bias results).
- **Customizable Questionnaire:** The feedback form used in 360s shall be configurable. Admins can define the questions or competencies to be rated. These can be a mix of **rating scale questions** (e.g., rate from 1-5 on specific behaviors) and **open-ended questions** for comments. The platform should support different templates for different levels or purposes (a 360 for senior leaders might use a different questionnaire than for junior employees).
- **Anonymous Feedback Collection:** The system shall anonymize responses for all rater categories except possibly the direct manager. No identifying information of individual peers or subordinates shall be visible to the feedback recipient or other peers. The system must ensure that **written comments** cannot accidentally reveal identity (for example, if only one direct report participates, perhaps combine that category with others or warn about anonymity limits).
- **Self-Feedback:** The system shall include the ability for the feedback subject to fill out the same questionnaire for themselves (self-rating), to enable self vs. others comparisons.
- **Notification & Reminder Workflow:** The system shall send an initial email/notification to each selected rater with instructions and a link to the feedback form. It shall send periodic reminders to those who haven’t completed the survey, up until the deadline. All communication should emphasize confidentiality and the importance of honest feedback.
- **Progress Tracking for Admins:** The system shall provide authorized users (HR or the subject’s manager, depending on configuration) a view of the status of feedback collection (e.g., which categories are complete, how many responses received vs. expected). Importantly, this view should **not** show the content of responses yet, only completion status.
- **Reporting & Result Aggregation:** Once the feedback phase ends, the system shall automatically compile the results into a **360 Feedback Report**. This report should include:

  - Quantitative summary: For each rated item or competency, show the average score (and possibly range or distribution) broken down by rater group (peers, reports, manager, self). A visual graph (bar chart or radar/spider chart) should illustrate differences between groups.
  - Qualitative feedback: List verbatim comments grouped by question or topic, labeling them by rater group (e.g., “Peer feedback comment” or “Direct report comment”) but not by name.
  - Key insights: The system might highlight notable gaps (e.g., “You rated yourself lower on X than others did”) or strengths (“All groups consistently rated you high on Y”).

- **Confidentiality Rules:** The system shall ensure that if a minimum number of feedback entries for a category is not met (to preserve anonymity), that category’s data is either not shown or combined. For example, if only 1 peer responded, their input might be merged under “All Others” in the report. Admins should be able to set this minimum threshold (commonly 3 or 4 respondents).
- **Access to Results:** The system shall allow only the appropriate people to see the 360 results. Typically, the feedback subject and their direct manager (and HR admins) can view the report. The subject’s peers or subordinates do not see the collective feedback – they only provide input. Access control should enforce this.
- **Integration with Development Plans:** The system shall allow the feedback results to seamlessly integrate into the employee’s development plan. For example, based on feedback, the employee or manager can create a new development goal (the system could even suggest it if certain competencies are low).
- **Follow-up Surveys:** The system should support follow-up 360s or pulse checks to measure progress. For instance, 6 months after the initial 360, a shorter survey could be sent to measure if improvements are noticed. This could be configured as part of the process (e.g., schedule a follow-up automatically).
- **Export & Print-Friendly Reports:** The 360 feedback report shall be exportable (PDF/Word) so that it can be shared or printed for an offline review or stored in an employee’s file if needed.
- **Feedback Administration Tools:** HR users might need to **modify or remove** certain feedback responses (e.g., if a comment is inappropriate). The system shall provide admin tools to moderate content if absolutely necessary (with tracking of such changes).
- **Guidance for Raters:** The platform (or accompanying content) should provide instructions or training pop-ups to help raters give effective feedback (e.g., tips on being constructive). While not a core functional requirement, this improves the quality of the process.

### 2.3 User Stories

- **As an HR Manager,** I want to initiate a 360-degree feedback process for all people managers in the company, so that each manager receives developmental feedback from their team, peers, and supervisor.
- **As an Employee (Feedback Subject),** I want to be able to suggest peers who I work with regularly to provide feedback on me, so that the feedback I receive is well-rounded and from relevant coworkers.
- **As a Manager,** I want to approve or adjust the list of raters for my direct report’s 360 feedback to ensure the selected peers and reports are appropriate and will give useful input.
- **As a Peer Rater,** I want to provide anonymous feedback through an easy-to-use survey, so I can candidly help my colleague improve without worrying about repercussions.
- **As a Direct Report Rater,** I want assurance that my feedback for my manager is confidential, so I feel safe to be honest about their leadership and communication.
- **As an HR Coordinator,** I want to monitor the completion of 360 surveys, so I can send reminders or extend deadlines if necessary to gather enough feedback data.
- **As an Employee (Feedback Subject),** I want to see a clear report of my 360 feedback results, including charts that compare my self-perception to how others perceive me, so that I can easily identify areas of strength and improvement.
- **As a Manager (of a feedback subject),** I want access to my report’s 360 feedback ahead of discussing with my employee, so I can formulate coaching points and guide them in creating a development plan.
- **As an Employee,** I want to translate insights from my 360 feedback into actionable development goals in the system, so that I can work on improving and track my progress over time.
- **As a Senior Leader,** I want the aggregate 360 feedback data (non-attributable) for my organization to see trends (e.g., common strengths or weaknesses across all managers), so that I can plan enterprise training (though such aggregation might be a reporting function with proper anonymity).

## 3. Goal Management (SMART Goals and Alignment)

Effective performance management hinges on setting and tracking **goals** for employees that align with broader organizational objectives. This section covers how the platform will support **Goal Management** – from creating individual SMART goals to cascading and aligning those goals with team and company goals. It addresses both **Goal Tracking** (monitoring individual goal progress over time) and **Alignment with Company Goals** (ensuring individual goals contribute to higher-level objectives).

The system should enable the creation of **S.M.A.R.T. goals** – goals that are _Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound_ – and allow those goals to be linked or cascaded from corporate objectives down to individual targets. This ensures that every employee understands how their work connects to the company’s strategy and mission.

**Key aspects of Goal Management include:** goal setting (with proper structure and measures), goal alignment (cascading goals up and down the org), ongoing tracking/updating of goal progress, and goal evaluation at period end. Additionally, support for different goal types (performance goals, development goals, project OKRs, etc.) and the ability to manage goal cycles (quarterly OKRs vs annual goals, for example) is important.

### 3.1 Goal Setting & SMART Goals

When creating a new goal in the system, the user (employee or manager) should be guided to make it SMART:

- **Specific:** The goal creator should specify exactly what is to be achieved. The system can provide fields like _“Goal Title”_ and _“Description”_ to capture the specifics. For example: “Improve customer satisfaction score” is specific (but could be more with specifics like which process to improve).
- **Measurable:** There should be a field for a measurable **target or KPI**. E.g., “Increase customer satisfaction score from 80% to 90%.” The system could have structured fields for current value and target value, or allow attaching a numeric metric. If qualitative, the user could define what measurement will indicate success.
- **Achievable:** The system can allow managers to approve goals to ensure they are realistic. There might not be a field for “achievable”, but guidance/tips can be shown.
- **Relevant:** Each goal can be categorized or linked to a broader objective to ensure it’s pertinent to job role or company strategy.
- **Time-bound:** Goals should have a due date or timeframe. The system must require a target completion date or milestone dates.

For example, a SMART goal entry in the system might look like:

- _Title:_ “Improve Customer Satisfaction Rating in Q1 Survey.”
- _Description/Details:_ “Implement a new customer follow-up process and training for support team to increase our Net Promoter Score (NPS).”
- _Measure of Success:_ “NPS to increase from 7.5 to 8.5 by end of Q1.”
- _Due Date:_ “March 31, 2025.”
- _Category/Type:_ “Customer Focus” (aligned to strategic pillar of Customer Satisfaction).

The platform should encourage that structure. Possibly, a template or wizard could help users articulate goals in SMART format (for instance, prompting “What metric will you use to measure this goal?”).

### 3.2 Goal Alignment and Cascading

Cascading goals means breaking down high-level objectives into sub-goals at lower organizational levels. The platform must allow linking an individual’s goal to their manager’s or to a top-level company goal, creating a clear **line of sight** from day-to-day tasks to strategic goals.

For example, consider a company-wide goal: “Launch 3 new product features by Q4.” This can cascade as:

- **Company Goal:** Launch 3 new features by Q4 (Product Department).

  - **Department Goal (Engineering):** Develop and release 3 new features (Engineering VP).

    - **Team Goal (Feature Team A):** Deliver Feature 1 by end of Q2 (Team A Lead).

      - **Individual Goal (Engineer on Team A):** Complete module X for Feature 1 by end of Q1.

    - **Team Goal (Feature Team B):** Deliver Feature 2 by end of Q3 (Team B Lead).

      - **Individual Goal (Engineer on Team B):** etc.

    - **Team Goal (Feature Team C):** Deliver Feature 3 by end of Q4… and so on.

  - **Department Goal (Marketing):** Prepare go-to-market campaigns for 3 new features by Q4 (Marketing Director).

    - (and those break into team/individual tasks like “Create marketing materials for Feature 1 by Q2” for a marketer).

The system should represent these relationships. Concretely, when adding a goal, a user should be able to select a parent goal it contributes to. For instance, when a manager enters their departmental goal, they link it to the company goal in the system (perhaps from a list of corporate OKRs). Then when an employee under that manager creates a personal goal, they can link it to the department goal.

In the UI, this could appear as a hierarchy or “goal tree” view. Some platforms present a **goal alignment diagram** showing how goals cascade up. Our platform should provide such a visualization – perhaps an interactive tree or at least a reference on each goal’s detail page like “Aligned to: \[Corporate Goal XYZ]”.

The benefit of alignment is **clarity and accountability**: _“Cascading goals connect individual work to overall organizational objectives”_, giving each employee a sense of purpose and showing how their performance impacts the broader mission.

Additionally, alignment allows aggregated progress tracking: if 5 sub-goals roll up to one goal, the parent goal’s completion could be calculated from the children’s progress (optionally).

**Cross-Alignment:** The system might also support goals that contribute to multiple higher goals or cross-functional alignment (though typically one primary alignment is enough). But consider a scenario: a sales goal might link to both a revenue objective and a customer satisfaction objective.

### 3.3 Goal Tracking and Updates

Once goals are set, both employees and managers need to track progress over the goal’s life cycle:

- The system should allow updating the **status** of a goal (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, On Hold, etc.) and **percentage complete**. For measurable numeric goals, progress might be updated by entering the current metric value (e.g., current sales = \$80k toward a \$100k target -> 80% complete).
- **Check-ins on goals:** The platform should encourage regular check-ins. For example, an employee can update progress and add a comment like “As of Feb, 50% of leads target achieved” and a manager can comment or adjust as needed.
- **Notifications/Reminders:** Users might get reminders to update goal progress, say monthly or before a check-in meeting. Goals nearing their deadline with no updates could trigger a reminder.
- **Visibility:** The employee, their manager, and upward management chain should have visibility into the goal status. Possibly peers or project leads might have view access if shared (especially if goals are cross-functional or team-shared goals). The system should allow choosing who can view a goal (e.g., mark a goal as private or public within the org).
- If a goal becomes irrelevant (due to business change), there should be an option to **modify or cancel** the goal, with appropriate approvals. For instance, mark it as “canceled” or edit the target. The history of changes should be tracked to maintain integrity.

At the end of the cycle (quarter or year), goal outcomes are reviewed. The system should ideally link this with the performance review process: a person’s goals and their completion status can be pulled into the performance review form for evaluation. For example, if an employee had 5 goals, the review form can show each goal and whether it was achieved (as input for the manager’s assessment).

Goal achievement might also tie into **compensation** if the company uses Management By Objectives (MBO) bonuses – see Compensation section for that.

### 3.4 Functional Requirements

- **Goal Creation:** The system shall allow users (employees and/or managers) to create individual goals with the following attributes: Title, Description, Due Date or Timeframe, Category (e.g., Strategic Pillar or Goal Type), and Measurement criteria (quantitative target or qualitative success criteria). It should enforce entering a due date or time period to make goals time-bound.
- **SMART Guidance:** The system should provide guidance or at least placeholders for SMART components. For example, it might have separate fields for _Metric/Target_ (Measurable) and _Target Date_ (Time-bound), and perhaps a checkbox or indicator if the goal meets all SMART criteria. This helps ensure goals are well-defined.
- **Goal Alignment Linking:** The system shall enable linking a goal to a higher-level goal. Users should be able to browse or search for a goal set by their manager or others (if granted visibility) and mark it as a parent goal. The system should store this relationship. Conversely, users with higher-level goals can cascade goals down by assigning sub-goals to team members (possibly by suggesting or creating linked goals for them).
- **Goal Hierarchy View:** The platform shall provide a visualization (or at least a structured list view) of goal alignment. For any given goal, a user should see its parent goal (if any) and any child (sub) goals linked to it. For instance, a manager can see all the individual goals under her department goal. Ideally, an interactive **“goal tree”** could display how goals cascade company-wide.
- **Shared and Team Goals:** The system shall support the concept of shared goals (goals that are common to multiple individuals or an entire team). For example, if a team of 5 shares a goal “Launch Project X by June”, that goal might appear in each of their profiles and progress is collective. In such cases, updates by one member could update for all, or each member might have sub-tasks. This needs to be configurable.
- **Goal Approval:** Optionally, the system shall allow managers to approve or edit goals set by their reports. For example, when an employee creates a new goal, it might require manager approval to become active. This ensures goals are aligned and achievable. The requirement for approval should be configurable per organization’s process.
- **Progress Updates:** The system shall allow users to update goal progress. This includes changing status (Not started/In progress/Completed) and percentage complete. If the goal has a numeric target, the user can input the current value and the system calculates percent complete. All updates should be timestamped and attributable.
- **Commentary & Check-ins:** The system shall allow comments or check-in notes on goals. Both the goal owner and the manager (and others with access) can log comments. For example: “Q2 update: 50% done, facing some delays due to X, plan to catch up in Q3.” These notes provide context and can be referenced during reviews.
- **Notifications:** The system shall send reminders to goal owners to update their goals periodically (e.g., monthly or quarterly, configurable). Also, as a due date nears, reminders should prompt goal owners and their managers if goals are not marked completed or updated. If a goal is past due without closure, a notification is sent.
- **Goal Library/Examples:** (Optional but useful) The system could provide a goal library or templates for common roles. While not required, this helps users write good goals. E.g., a sales rep could choose from a template like “Achieve \$X sales by Y date” and then customize it.
- **Alignment Enforcement:** If a company uses OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), the system should support having key results as goals that align under an Objective. This is similar to cascading: an Objective might be a non-measurable statement, with several measurable Key Results linked. The system shall allow grouping goals as Key Results under a higher Objective.
- **Privacy and Sharing:** The system shall allow marking a goal’s visibility. Some goals (like personal development goals) might be private (visible only to the employee and their manager/HR), whereas performance goals might be visible more broadly for alignment transparency. The platform should have settings like “Manager-only” vs “Public to department” vs “Public to entire company” for each goal. (Public in this sense means viewable, not editable, by others in the org chart).
- **Tagging or Categorization:** The system shall allow categorizing goals by type (e.g., Performance Goal, Development Goal, Project Goal) or by strategic theme (Customer Satisfaction, Innovation, etc.). This helps in reporting (e.g., how many goals relate to Customer Satisfaction) and alignment.
- **Carryover & Continuous Goals:** The system shall support goals that span multiple periods or carry over. If a goal isn’t finished by year-end, it might continue into the next year. The platform should allow renewing or cloning the goal for the new period, possibly with adjusted targets.
- **Integration with Performance Reviews:** The system shall seamlessly integrate goal data into the performance review process. For example, when a manager is evaluating an employee, they should see each of that employee’s goals, the final status, and any self-comments on the goal. The manager’s review form could auto-populate a section with this info for them to comment on goal achievement.
- **Analytics on Goals:** (More in reporting section) The platform shall be able to report on goal progress across the organization – e.g., % of goals achieved per department, or lists of all goals aligned to a certain corporate objective and their statuses.
- **Cascading Changes:** If a parent goal’s target or timeline changes, the system should optionally notify owners of aligned sub-goals. For instance, if the company delays a product launch (company goal date moves), all linked sub-goals should be updated or at least flagged to align. This might not auto-change them but warns users to adjust their goals accordingly.
- **Goal Weighting:** For organizations that weight goals (say each goal is X% of the performance rating or bonus), the system shall allow assigning a weight to each goal. Sum of weights per person could be 100%. This weight can then factor into overall performance scoring or compensation calculations.

### 3.5 User Stories

- **As a Manager,** I want to easily carry forward an unfinished goal to the next quarter (or adjust its deadline) if business priorities shifted, so that the goal tracking remains relevant and I don’t lose the history of work done so far.

## 4. Continuous Performance Tracking & Feedback

In addition to formal reviews and goal tracking, modern performance management emphasizes **continuous feedback and visibility** into performance throughout the year. This section outlines how the platform provides ongoing performance tracking – giving managers and employees a real-time view of progress and facilitating frequent feedback conversations (e.g., one-on-one meetings, instant feedback, and coaching).

Performance tracking here refers to capturing day-to-day or week-to-week performance indicators and feedback, rather than waiting for the end of a quarter or year. It ensures **visibility into employee progress** on a continuous basis, helping to identify issues early and recognize achievements timely.

Key capabilities include: a **dashboard or profile** for each employee showing their goals, recent feedback received, and key performance indicators; tools for managers and employees to record notes or journal entries about performance; and scheduling and logging regular check-in meetings (one-on-ones).

Additionally, **continuous feedback** mechanisms allow anyone in the organization to give feedback to anyone else at any time (with certain permissions) – for example, a quick kudos or constructive feedback note. This complements formal 360 processes by making feedback a regular habit rather than an isolated event.

### 4.1 Description

**Performance Dashboard/Profile:** The platform should offer a consolidated view of an employee’s performance data. For example, when a manager clicks on one of her direct reports, she should see a **Performance Profile** of that employee. This could include:

- A summary of current goals and their progress (from section 3).
- Past performance review results (ratings from last cycle, etc.).
- Recent 360 feedback highlights or any recent survey feedback on that person.
- A timeline of significant achievements or milestones.
- Any performance warnings or improvement plans if applicable.
- Perhaps a snapshot of skills or competencies (if tracked, e.g., competency ratings).

This gives the manager visibility at a glance on how the person is doing, beyond waiting for annual review.

For the employee themselves, a similar dashboard helps them track their own progress and feedback.

**Continuous Feedback / Check-Ins:** The system should allow and encourage frequent interactions:

- **One-on-One Meetings:** Managers and employees often have periodic 1:1 meetings (weekly, bi-weekly). The platform can facilitate by allowing the creation of a 1:1 agenda or notes. For example, a manager could schedule a 1:1, have an agenda in the system (topics to discuss, maybe pulled from pending goals or feedback), and after the meeting, record notes or action items. This creates a log of discussions that both can reference.
- **Instant Feedback (Peer or Manager-to-Employee):** At any time, a user should be able to give another user feedback. This could be a **“Give Feedback”** button where you choose a colleague and write a short note, possibly tagging a company value or rating something. The feedback can be positive recognition (“Great job on the client presentation yesterday!”) or developmental (“I noticed in the meeting, there was some confusion—perhaps clarify objectives at the start next time.”). The giver can choose visibility – either share it with the recipient only, or also visible to the recipient’s manager, etc. The system logs this feedback. Some systems integrate this with social recognition (like badges or kudos) – that could be a nice-to-have.
- **Feedback Requests:** An employee or manager can request feedback from others at any time (outside of a formal 360). For example, after finishing a project, an employee can request feedback from project team members via the system, and those folks get a prompt to provide quick feedback.

**Performance Journals:** The platform could provide a private (or shared with manager) journal for both employees and managers to note observations. E.g., a manager notes “Employee handled X incident very well” or “Employee struggled with Y task” on the date it happened. These notes can later be referenced during formal reviews so nothing is forgotten. Likewise, employees can keep a log of accomplishments (“Closed deal with ABC Corp on May 5th”) to help recall them later.

**KPI Tracking:** In some roles, performance tracking might involve metrics (like sales numbers, call resolution time, etc.) that update frequently. The system might integrate with other systems or allow manual update of these KPIs in the performance dashboard. For example, a salesperson’s dashboard might show year-to-date sales vs target (possibly pulling automatically from a sales system via API). This real-time performance data is valuable for manager check-ins.

In summary, continuous performance tracking means the system isn’t just used at review time – it’s used year-round to track progress and foster dialogue. This leads to fewer surprises in reviews and more agile performance management.

### 4.2 Functional Requirements

- **Employee Performance Dashboard:** The system shall provide a consolidated performance dashboard for each employee, visible to the employee and their manager (and higher management, and HR). This dashboard should display key info: active goals and progress, upcoming or overdue tasks (like reviews or training), recent feedback (snippets of continuous feedback received), and performance metrics or rating history if applicable.
- **One-on-One Meeting Tool:** The system shall include a feature to schedule and document one-on-one meetings between a manager and a direct report. It should allow either party to create a meeting record with date/time (possibly integrating with Outlook/Google Calendar), set an agenda or topics, and afterwards record notes or summary. Both manager and employee should be able to view and contribute to these notes (unless marked private). Historical one-on-one entries should be stored for reference. Optionally, the system might offer suggested agenda items such as “Discuss progress on Goal X” or “Review recent feedback” drawn from the system data.
- **Real-Time Feedback (Recognition & Coaching):** The system shall allow any user (with appropriate permission rules) to give feedback to any other user at any time:

  - Users can select a colleague’s name, enter a feedback message, optionally tag it with predefined tags or values (like selecting a company core value that the feedback exemplifies, e.g., “#Innovation”).
  - Feedback can be marked as **positive recognition** or **developmental**. For positive feedback, the system might have an option to make it public or visible to the team (like a “social feed” of shout-outs), whereas constructive feedback might default to private between giver and receiver (and perhaps the receiver’s manager).
  - The receiver of feedback gets a notification and can acknowledge or reply (e.g., “Thanks for the feedback!”).
  - All feedback given/received is logged in the system, attached to the recipient’s profile (visible according to configured rules – e.g., managers can see feedback their subordinate received).

- **Feedback Requests:** The system shall allow a user to solicit feedback on themselves or on one of their reports. For example, “Request feedback on John Doe” – the requester chooses people to ask (or the system suggests recent collaborators), optionally specifies topics (e.g., “Feedback on John’s presentation in the X project”), and the selected people get a task to provide quick feedback. This is similar to 360 but ad-hoc and typically simpler (maybe just a comment or a quick rating).
- **Performance Notes / Journal:** The system shall provide a way for managers and employees to record notes about performance events:

  - A **Manager’s Journal** for each employee: private to the manager (and perhaps up the chain or HR, but not visible to the employee). This is for managers to jot down incidents of note (good or bad) throughout the year. These notes can then be referenced when filling the formal review. The system should make it easy to transfer a journal note into the review comments if desired.
  - An **Employee’s Journal**: private to the employee (unless they choose to share with manager). The employee can log accomplishments, challenges, or reflections. This helps them keep track of things to bring up in reviews or one-on-ones.
  - These notes should be timestamped. Possibly allow attaching files or emails (e.g., an appreciation email from a client could be attached to a note).

- **Metric/KPI Integration:** The system shall allow tracking of key performance indicators for individuals if applicable. Admins or managers should be able to define a numeric metric for a role (e.g., “Sales YTD” for salespeople, “Tickets Closed” for support, etc.) and update it manually or via integration (see API section for pulling from external systems). Those metrics then show up in the employee’s dashboard. The system should be able to chart these over time. This effectively provides a quantifiable performance tracking in real-time.
- **Alerts for Performance Issues:** If a manager notices a performance problem and starts an improvement plan (see section 6 on Development/PIP), the system should flag on the employee’s profile that a PIP is in progress. Similarly, exceptional performance can be flagged (e.g., “High Performer” tag). This gives context in tracking.
- **Mobile Access for Feedback:** Continuous feedback and check-ins should be accessible via mobile. The system shall have a responsive design or mobile app such that a manager can quickly give a recognition on their phone, or an employee can update a goal status after a meeting, etc. This encourages on-the-spot use.
- **Searchable Feedback/Notes:** The accumulated feedback and notes should be searchable and filterable. For example, before a review, a manager can filter their journal notes for that employee over the last year, or an employee can search all feedback received with the tag “communication” to see how they’ve improved.
- **Privacy and Control:** The system must allow appropriate privacy controls on continuous tracking data:

  - A manager’s private notes should not be visible to the employee.
  - Peer-to-peer feedback default privacy should be carefully configured: perhaps positive feedback could be public (to enable recognition culture), but critical feedback is private. Possibly, a user giving feedback can choose “Make this visible to others” or not.
  - If the system includes a public recognition feed (like a company wall of praise), users should have to explicitly opt to share a feedback note to that feed.

- **One-on-One Templates:** Optionally, provide one-on-one meeting templates or question prompts. E.g., have a default template: “What’s going well? What are challenges? What support do you need? Any feedback for me?” etc., to guide effective check-ins. This can be configured by HR.
- **Continuous Feedback Analytics:** The system shall record data about feedback frequency (who is giving feedback, how often, recognition counts, etc.). This data can be used by HR to gauge engagement. For example, see which teams have a strong feedback culture (many feedback entries) vs. which do not – though this might be more in reporting.
- **Integration with Email/Chat:** As a convenience, the system might allow sending feedback via email or chat integration (like a Slack bot that records a feedback given command). While not critical, it enhances continuous use.

### 4.3 User Stories

- **As a Manager,** I want a quick view of each of my direct reports’ performance status (goals, feedback, etc.) in one place, so that I am always aware of how they are doing without waiting for formal reviews.
- **As an Employee,** I want to log my weekly accomplishments and roadblocks in a personal journal, so I can keep track of my own performance and have detailed information to share during my review.
- **As an Employee,** I want to receive quick feedback from my colleagues after we complete a project together, so I know what I did well or what I could do better immediately, rather than months later.
- **As a Peer,** I want to give a coworker a shout-out for helping me meet a deadline by submitting a positive feedback note through the system, so that my coworker feels recognized and their manager can also see their good work.
- **As an Employee,** I want to privately request feedback from a project manager I worked with, so I can get their perspective and use it to improve, even though they’re not my direct manager.
- **As a Manager,** I want to schedule recurring one-on-one meetings with each team member and have a shared space to list topics and notes, so our discussions are documented and we can both refer back to what was decided or promised.
- **As a Manager,** I want to jot down notes whenever I observe significant behavior (good or bad) from my team members, so that I have concrete examples to mention in their performance reviews and I don’t rely on memory alone.
- **As an HR Administrator,** I want to see that managers are regularly holding one-on-ones and giving feedback (or not), so I can encourage a culture of continuous feedback and intervene with training if some managers aren’t engaging.
- **As an Employee,** I want to see all the feedback I’ve received in one place on my profile, so that I can identify patterns in what people praise me for or suggest I improve.
- **As a Sales Manager,** I want the system to show each salesperson’s current sales vs quota on their profile (updated daily from our sales system), so that I can discuss performance in real time during pipeline reviews and not wait until quarter-end.
- **As a Senior Executive,** I want assurance that feedback data is being captured and used responsibly – e.g., I want to see overall metrics of engagement with continuous feedback, because it indicates how well the performance management culture is being adopted.
- **As an Employee,** I want to give my manager feedback as well (upward feedback) outside of formal reviews, perhaps after a project or meeting, so that managers also continuously improve. (The system should allow upward feedback, possibly with anonymity if needed).

## 5. Development and Improvement Planning

Beyond evaluating past performance, a core aspect of performance management is guiding **future development**. This section covers how the platform supports creating and managing **Development Plans** for employees – including setting performance improvement plans (PIPs) for underperformers and general development goals/training plans for growth.

**Development Planning** involves identifying areas for improvement or growth for each employee, and documenting an actionable plan to address them. This could be part of the review outcome (e.g., “Needs improvement in X skill, plan: take training Y”) or initiated any time (for example, a high-potential employee creating a career development plan, or a manager starting a formal PIP when performance is below expectations).

Key features of development planning include: the ability to create **development goals or actions** (distinct from performance goals, often not directly tied to job KPIs but skills/competencies), tracking completion of development activities (like training courses, mentoring sessions), and linking these plans to performance data (like if someone had a low score on “communication” in their review, their dev plan might target communication courses).

### 5.1 Description

**Performance Improvement Plans (PIP):** When an employee is not meeting expectations, managers (with HR oversight) often put them on a formal PIP. This outlines specific performance shortfalls, sets improvement targets, actions to take, and a timeline (often 30-90 days). The system should allow creating a PIP document in the employee’s profile. It should include:

- Issues to address (e.g., “Quality of code not meeting standards in last 3 projects”).
- Expected standards (e.g., “Zero critical bugs in next release; complete code training module by date”).
- Action plan (training, more supervision, etc.).
- Review checkpoints (weekly check-ins, mid-point evaluation, final evaluation).
- A final outcome (improvement satisfactory or not).

The system can have a template for PIPs to ensure completeness. It should restrict access (private between that employee, their manager, and HR).

**Development Goals/Plans:** For all employees (not just low performers), development planning is about **growth**. This could involve:

- **Skill development goals:** e.g., “Become proficient in Python programming by end of year.”
- **Training and education:** The employee might enroll in courses, certifications, or workshops. The system could integrate with an LMS (Learning Management System) or at least allow linking to training entries.
- **Coaching/Mentorship:** Plan might include mentoring sessions, coaching from a senior, or rotating assignments to develop new skills.
- **Career development actions:** If the employee aspires to a next role, their plan might include specific experiences needed for that (like “lead a project to gain leadership experience”).

The platform should allow documenting these items and tracking them. For example, an employee can have a development plan with 3 items: 1) Complete Advanced Excel training by June, 2) Present at least one proposal in team meetings to build presentation skills, 3) Take on a mentee to develop leadership.

**Integration with Goals & Reviews:** Development plans often come out of review discussions. After a performance review, if a competency was rated low, the manager might add a development item. The system should make it easy to transition from a review to populating a development plan section. Likewise, during the year, completing a development action (like finishing a course) might feed back into the performance records.

**Career Paths:** If the system includes defined career paths (like a role hierarchy or competency matrix), the development plan could tie into that: E.g., if John wants to move from Engineer to Senior Engineer, the system might know the competencies needed and suggest development actions to close gaps. (This overlaps with Career & Succession Planning section.)

### 5.2 Functional Requirements

- **Development Plan Creation:** The system shall allow creation of a formal **Development Plan** for each employee, consisting of one or more development actions or goals. Each action should have: a description, a target completion date, and a way to mark completion (and possibly a field for how success will be measured, similar to SMART style but often qualitative).
- **Link to Competencies/Skills:** If the organization uses a competency model, the development plan item should optionally link to a competency. For example, “Improve Presentation Skills” could link to the competency “Communication” which was assessed in a review. This way progress can be tracked in that competency over time (if competency ratings are updated).
- **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Workflow:** The system shall provide a specific template or mode for Performance Improvement Plans:

  - Only a manager (and HR) can initiate a PIP for an employee, possibly requiring HR approval or notification.
  - The PIP template should include fields to document performance deficiencies, improvement targets, actions to be taken, and review dates. Possibly a separate section for manager comments vs employee comments.
  - The system should allow setting a PIP period (like 60 days) and perhaps schedule interim review checkpoints (the manager would then document progress at those points within the PIP record).
  - It shall notify the manager and employee of upcoming PIP checkpoint dates or the PIP end date.
  - At the conclusion, the manager (and HR) update the PIP outcome (Successful completion, Extended, or Termination recommended). This record remains in the system for future reference (viewable by HR and relevant managers).
  - PIP records need a higher level of confidentiality – likely only visible to the employee, their manager, and HR (not to future managers unless HR grants, etc., since it’s sensitive).

- **Development Goal Library:** The system could provide suggestions for development actions. For instance, if “Improve X skill” is identified, the system might suggest “Attend <course name>” if such a course is listed or “Work with mentor on X”. Admins could maintain a library of development activities and link them to competencies. (This is optional but useful for guiding managers who might not know how to help an employee improve a particular skill.)
- **Integration with Training/LMS:** If the company has a Learning Management System or training catalog, the performance system shall integrate or at least reference it. For example, if an employee’s plan includes “Complete Project Management Certification,” the system might link to the LMS course or at least mark when it’s completed. Through API integration (section 13) the status of training completion could update automatically in the development plan.
- **Progress Tracking:** The system shall allow managers and employees to update the status of each development plan item (similar to goal tracking). E.g., mark an item as “In Progress” or “Completed” and add notes (“Completed training on Oct 10, awaiting certificate”).
- **Manager/Employee Collaboration:** Both the employee and their manager should be able to view and edit development plan entries (in contrast to goals, which might primarily be employee-driven, development is often a joint agreement). Perhaps the manager creates one in the review meeting and the employee can later add details or mark done. Edits might require mutual agreement or at least notifications to the other party.
- **Reminders:** The system shall send reminders for development actions just like goals. If an action is due by a date, remind the employee and manager as it approaches. Also, periodic check-ins: maybe mid-year, ask employees to update their development progress (since these can be easy to neglect).
- **Link to Career Plans:** If the employee has indicated a desired career path or role (maybe in a profile or succession module), the development plan could highlight relevant actions. E.g., “Aspiring to Manager – consider taking Leadership 101 training.” (This might tie in with Career Planning section).
- **Visibility:** Generally, an employee’s development plan should be visible to the employee, their manager, and HR/authorized personnel. It wouldn’t usually be visible to peers or other lower-level managers. Possibly higher-ups (like a department head) could see the development plans of their subordinates’ subordinates for oversight. The system shall allow control of who can see/edit development plans.
- **Integration with Reviews:** The system shall incorporate a section in the performance review form (or process) to discuss and capture development plans. For example, after scoring competencies, the review form might have “Development Actions agreed upon:” which then populates the development plan on submit. There should be minimal duplication – e.g., data entered in one place automatically shows in the other context.
- **Historical Tracking:** The system shall keep historical development plans and PIPs. If an employee had a PIP two years ago, and then improved, and later perhaps relapsed, managers (with HR permission) might see that history. Or if an employee moves to a new manager, HR might or might not decide to share past PIPs – maybe only HR can see very old or sensitive ones. In any case, version control of plans (for each year’s development plan) should be maintained.
- **Acknowledgment:** For PIPs especially, the system should record that the employee has seen the plan (an acknowledgment like sign-off, similar to review sign-off). For general development plans, an acknowledgment isn’t as formal but the employee’s agreement should be implicit by their participation.
- **Mentor/Mentee Assignment:** The system might allow assigning a mentor as part of a development plan. If so, that mentor (who could be another user in the system) might get some visibility or notifications relevant to guiding the employee. This is an advanced feature but some plans involve mentors or coaches.
- **Templates:** Possibly have templates for common development needs. E.g., a PIP template vs a “High Potential development plan template” vs a “New manager 90-day development plan” template. Admins should be able to set these up if needed, to streamline the creation of development plans for recurring scenarios.

### 5.3 User Stories

- **As a Manager,** I want to create a formal Performance Improvement Plan for an underperforming employee, so that I can clearly document the performance issues, the improvement steps required, and provide a structured timeline for them to improve.
- **As an HR Partner,** I want to be notified when a manager places someone on a PIP and be able to review the plan details, so that I can ensure fairness and compliance with our performance policies and assist if necessary.
- **As an Employee,** I want to view and acknowledge my PIP online, so I fully understand what I need to improve and by when, and there is a record that I have agreed to work on it.
- **As a Manager,** I want to log progress notes at each checkpoint of a PIP (e.g., 30-day review), so that there is a documented track of improvements made or not made, which will inform the final decision.
- **As an Employee,** I want to collaboratively build a development plan with my manager during my annual review, focusing on areas I want to grow (not just weaknesses, also career aspirations), so that I have a clear development roadmap for the next year.
- **As an Employee,** I want to add a development goal for myself (for example, learn a new skill) at any time, even outside of the review cycle, so I can take ownership of my professional growth and track it formally.
- **As a Manager,** I want to suggest a course from our training catalog for my employee and add it to their development plan, so that it's officially recorded and we can track if they complete it.
- **As an HR Admin,** I want to configure the system to prompt managers to fill out a development plan section for any competency rated below “Meets Expectations” in a review, so that weaknesses are proactively addressed with an action plan.
- **As an Employee,** I want to mark when I have completed a development action (like finishing a certification) and maybe attach a proof certificate, so that my manager knows I've completed it and it can be accounted as an achievement.
- **As a New Manager,** I want to see what development plans my inherited team members have, so I can continue supporting them on those plans rather than starting from scratch.
- **As a Mentor (assigned in a development plan),** I want to see the specific goals that my mentee is working on and any context from their review, so I can better coach them to achieve those development goals.
- **As a Senior Leader,** I want to ensure that high potential employees have formal development plans geared towards leadership preparation, so I might request reports on development activities for our talent pool (tie-in with succession planning).
- **As an HR Admin,** I want to maintain templates of common PIPs or development plans for recurring situations (like attendance issues, or first-time managers), so that managers have a starting point and don’t miss important elements when creating plans.

## 6. Career and Succession Planning

Career and succession planning features ensure that the organization can **clarify career paths**, develop internal talent, and have plans for **succession** in key roles. This module of the platform goes beyond day-to-day performance to a longer-term view of talent development and mobility.

**Career Planning:** For the individual employee, the system should provide visibility into potential career paths (e.g., what roles they could aim for) and what is required to get there. It can help answer: “Where can I go from my current role, and what skills or performance level do I need to reach the next step?” It may include **career path charts** or role profiles, and allow employees to express interest in future roles or track their readiness.

**Succession Planning:** For the organization, it’s critical to identify and prepare **successors** for key positions (especially leadership or critical skill roles). The platform should support creating **succession plans** for specific roles – listing potential candidates, their readiness level, and development actions to prepare them. It often uses tools like the **9-Box grid** (mapping performance vs potential) to classify talent. Succession planning ensures internal growth and business continuity if someone leaves a role.

These features tie closely to performance data: high-performing, high-potential individuals are the ones targeted for growth opportunities, and performance reviews and feedback feed into assessing potential.

### 6.1 Description

**Career Paths:** The system might contain a library of roles with defined competencies or experience needed. For example, Role: _Sales Representative_ could progress to _Senior Sales Rep_, then to _Sales Manager_, etc. Each progression could show what criteria are needed (e.g., certain performance rating, certain training, X years experience). The platform can show an employee possible next roles (“career ladder” or lattice) and optionally allow them to indicate interest in a path.

For instance, an employee in Software Engineer I role might see:

- **Next Role:** Software Engineer II – requires 2 years experience and proficiency in defined skills.
- **Future Role:** Software Engineer III or Team Lead – requires demonstrating leadership, certain performance level.
  The system could highlight gaps (skills they need to develop, maybe using their development plan from section 5 to close those gaps).

Some systems allow employees to create a **Career Plan** – essentially a personal plan of where they want to be in X years and what steps to take (overlaps with development plan but more future-role oriented). This could be part of an employee profile.

**Succession Plans:** Typically, succession is managed by HR and leadership:

- They identify “Key Positions” (like VP roles, critical technical roles, etc.).
- For each such position, they identify a list of “Successors” (potential replacements) – often categorized as _Ready now, Ready in 1-2 years, Ready in 3-5 years_ depending on their current state.
- A **succession plan profile** for each candidate could include: current role, performance history, potential rating, key strengths, development needs, and whether they are interested in that future role (some might not want to relocate or take that job).
- The platform should let them build these plans and update them periodically (often annually during a “talent review” meeting).
- Graphical tools: the **9-Box grid** is commonly used to assess talent for succession. It plots employees on a 3x3 matrix of performance vs potential【26†】. High performers with high potential are the pipeline for promotion (“Stars” or “High Potentials”), etc. The system could allow placing people in a 9-box, or at least capturing their potential rating (e.g., a field for potential: Low/Med/High).
- Succession Chart: Another visualization is an org chart that shows, for a given person/position, who are the successors lined up.

**Talent Pools:** Instead of per-position succession, some orgs use “talent pools” (e.g., a pool of candidates for any leadership role). The system could support grouping high potentials in pools (like “Leadership Pool”, “Critical Engineers Pool”) and track their progress.

**Career Development Programs:** If the company runs specific programs for career development (mentorship, rotations, etc.), the system should manage or at least record participation in those as part of career growth data.

### 6.2 Functional Requirements

- **Role Profiles & Paths:** The system shall store information about job roles and possible career progressions. Admins or HR should be able to define **career paths** (like a hierarchy or lattice of roles). This includes: role name, description, typical requirements (skills, experience, maybe typical salary grade though that might be HRIS territory), and next possible roles. There might be multiple next roles (not everyone goes into management; paths can branch).
- **Employee Career Preferences:** The system shall allow employees to input career interests or preferences. For example: desired next role, or areas they want to grow into. They could mark themselves as interested in management track vs technical track, etc. This info can be visible to HR and managers for succession planning.
- **Career Planning Tools:** The platform shall provide a view for employees to explore roles. E.g., an employee can click “Career Path” and see a graph or list of roles above or lateral to theirs and the requirements for those. They could compare their current profile to the target role’s requirements and see what they need to develop (like “Target: PMP certification – Not achieved yet” or “Needs 3 years experience, you have 1 year”). This fosters self-driven development aligned with career moves.
- **Succession Plan Creation:** The system shall allow creation of **succession plans for positions**. For a given position (identified likely by title and department, possibly tied to actual incumbent), HR or a Manager can list successors. Each successor entry should include: the person’s name, current role, readiness timeframe (ready now, 1-2 years, etc.), and notes (like key strengths/weaknesses relative to that target role).
- **Successor Ranking/Rating:** The system shall allow rating potential or ranking successors. Many companies use a “potential” rating (like on a 3-point scale). The system should capture that (it might be in the review as well, e.g., managers rate potential of their employees). Or at least allow HR to classify employees as High/Med/Low potential. Possibly integrate with a 9-box grid: if performance data is present (from reviews) and a potential rating is given, the system can plot each employee in a 9-box matrix. Ideally, the UI can display the 9-box for a team or the whole organization, which helps discussions.
- **Talent Profiles:** For succession, it’s useful to have a one-page “talent profile” for each candidate (some systems call it talent card). The system shall present relevant info about an employee when considering them for succession: e.g., performance scores over last few years, potential rating, competency strengths, languages spoken, relocation willingness, etc. We should allow storing such info (some might come from performance reviews or from an employee talent survey/profile).
- **Gap Analysis for Successors:** The system could highlight what a successor might need to be ready. E.g., if Jane is a successor for Engineering Manager, but she lacks people management experience – the plan might be to get her that experience. This ties to her development plan (the system should link the succession plan to development actions: “Jane to lead a small project team in the next 6 months as preparation”).
- **Succession Org Chart View:** The platform shall allow viewing the org chart with succession info. For example, click on the VP of Sales, see their position details and a list of 2-3 identified successors and their readiness. If a successor is ready now, maybe green highlight; if gap, maybe an icon indicating development needed.
- **Privacy and Access:** Succession data is sensitive. The system must restrict it typically to HR and senior leaders. An employee generally should not see their own “potential rating” explicitly, or whether they are in someone’s succession plan (some companies keep it confidential to avoid promises). Maybe if an employee is officially on a development track, they know, but in general the platform’s succession info should be secured. So, robust access control: likely only HR admins and maybe the top management have full visibility, managers might see plans for their org (like a department head can see succession plans for roles in their dept), but not beyond.
- **Succession Planning Workflow:** The system shall support the process of updating succession plans periodically. For example: each year HR can initiate a “Talent Review” event. Managers log in, review their team’s performance/potential, update who they think could succeed them or others, fill in data. Then there’s a meeting where they use the system’s 9-box and succession lists to discuss. The system should allow exporting or presenting the 9-box and succession lists easily (maybe an interactive meeting mode).
- **High-Potential Identification:** The system shall allow tagging certain employees as high-potential or part of a “talent pool”. For instance, after a talent review, HR can mark the top 10% as High-Po. The system should then allow filtering those individuals in reports or giving them special development resources.
- **Career Development Plans (Integration):** The individual development plans from section 5 should integrate with career/succession. For example, if someone is named a successor for a role, it should trigger or suggest adding development activities relevant to that role (like mentorship under current role-holder, or specific training). Conversely, if someone completes all dev goals for a next role, managers might consider them “ready now”.
- **Mentoring & Rotational Assignments:** The platform could record if an employee is undergoing special programs, like leadership training courses, rotational assignments, etc., as part of succession planning. Perhaps allow HR to log that John is in a “Leadership Development Program 2025” and expected to be ready for promotion after.
- **Notification of Vacancies:** If a key position becomes vacant (or will, due to retirement), the system could notify relevant HR/managers and pull up the succession plan. Not strictly necessary, but helpful. Also if a successor leaves the company, alert that a succession plan needs updating (since that bench is gone).
- **9-Box Grid Tool:** Provide an interactive 9-Box grid interface where during talent review, leaders can move employees between boxes (maybe just by updating their performance/potential categories). The system can pre-place them based on last performance rating and a potential rating field, but allow adjustment and save. A visual like \*\*\*\* could be displayed to categorize employees into nine segments of performance vs potential. (We might include the image with citation as an example in documentation, but in platform it's dynamic data.)
- **Reporting:** The system shall support reporting around succession, such as:

  - How many key positions have ready successors vs none.
  - List of all high-potentials and their current placement.
  - Diversity in succession pipelines (e.g., ensure a diverse pool).
  - Succession coverage: some positions might have multiple potential successors (coverage is good), others none (risk).

- **Employee Access to Career Paths:** Unlike succession which is restricted, career path info is typically open to employees. The system must make it easy for employees to see potential opportunities. Possibly incorporate internal job postings or allow them to indicate interest (some systems let employees raise a hand for roles, but that blurs into recruiting).
- **Successor Interest/Willingness:** The system should note if a potential successor is actually interested in that role (some might not want to relocate to headquarters for a promotion, for example). HR/Managers should capture that either as a flag or note on the plan.

### 6.3 Functional Requirements in Succinct List

_(Combining above into the formal list format for clarity):_

- **Career Path Library:** The system shall maintain a library of roles and defined career paths/progression routes within the organization.
- **Employee Career Profile:** The system shall allow employees to view possible career moves from their current role and to record their career interests and aspirations (desired future roles, willingness to relocate, etc.).
- **Succession Plans for Positions:** The system shall enable HR or authorized managers to create succession plans for specific key positions, listing one or more potential successors for each position along with their readiness and development needs.
- **Potential and Readiness Ratings:** The system shall support tagging or rating employees on **potential** (e.g., Low/Medium/High or numerical) and **readiness timeframes** for advancement (e.g., Ready Now, <2 years, 2-5 years). These fields can be used to generate talent matrices and succession insights.
- **9-Box Talent Matrix:** The system shall provide a tool or report (visual grid) to plot employees on a 9-box grid of performance vs potential, using performance ratings data (from reviews) and potential ratings (from succession planning) as axes. Users (HR/management) should be able to adjust placements by updating values and see the grid update.
- **Talent Profile View:** For each employee, especially those considered for promotion, the system shall present a “talent profile” summary including performance history (e.g., last 3 ratings), potential rating, key competencies, current role tenure, and any development or career plan info. This helps decision-makers quickly evaluate the person.
- **Succession Candidate Management:** Within a succession plan, for each potential successor, the system shall allow storing notes and attributes, such as: what development steps they need to be ready, whether they have indicated interest, who their mentor is, etc. Possibly link to their development plan.
- **Multiple Successors & Multiple Plans:** The system shall handle that one person can be a successor for multiple roles, and one role can have multiple successors. It should be easy to see if a certain high-potential is showing up as successor for many roles (could indicate they’re key talent to develop/retain).
- **Talent Pools:** The system shall allow grouping employees into talent pools (e.g., “Future leaders pool”). This might be done via a flag or group membership in the system. Pools can be used instead or in addition to position-based plans for broader development programs.
- **Mentoring/Programs Tracking:** The system shall allow HR to track if an employee is part of a special program (e.g., in a mentorship program, or on an international assignment as career broadening). This info can be part of succession data to gauge experience breadth.
- **Reporting for Succession:** The system shall provide reports such as “Succession Coverage” (what % of key roles have at least 1 ready successor), “High Potential List” (all employees tagged high potential with their current performance), and “Vacancy Risk” (roles with no successors identified).
- **Confidentiality:** Succession and potential data shall be restricted to authorized users. For instance, managers may see potential ratings or succession info for their team or below, but not above. Employees should generally not see their own potential rating (unless policy allows) nor see lists of successors for roles (to avoid sensitive info). The system must have granular access control to enforce this.
- **Career Plan Integration:** The system shall allow an employee’s personal career development plan (from their perspective) to be linked with organizational succession plans. For example, if an employee aspires to Role X which they’ve noted in their profile, and there is a succession plan for Role X, HR might include them in that plan if appropriate.
- **Notifications & Updates:** The system shall remind HR/managers to update succession plans periodically (e.g., annual talent review cycle). It could also notify HR if a key role becomes vacant or if a designated successor leaves the company or changes roles (so succession plans can be updated accordingly).
- **Export and Presentation:** Succession plans and career path charts shall be exportable or presentable in meetings. The system should support printing a succession plan summary or generating slides (or at least Excel/PDF exports) with key info to share with executives during planning sessions.

### 6.4 User Stories

- **As an Employee,** I want to explore possible career paths for my role in the system, so I can understand what opportunities exist for advancement or lateral moves and what I need to accomplish to get there.
- **As an Employee,** I want to record that I’m interested in a managerial track (or a specific future role), so that my HR and managers are aware of my aspirations during talent reviews.
- **As a Manager,** I want to identify at least two team members who could potentially take over my role in the future, and document a plan to prepare them, so that if I move up or leave, the department will have continuity.
- **As an HR Business Partner,** I want to review all key leadership positions and ensure each has a succession plan with ready candidates, so that the company is not caught off guard by departures and we foster internal promotions.
- **As an HR Business Partner,** I want to use the system’s 9-box grid to facilitate our annual talent review meeting, so that we can visually discuss which employees are top talent (high performance/high potential) and which need attention (low performance or low potential).
- **As a Senior Executive,** I want to see a report of our high-potential employees across the company, including their current roles, performance and potential ratings, and what positions they are in line for, so I can ensure we are investing in the right people for future leadership.
- **As an HR Admin,** I want to restrict access to the succession planning data so that only HR and relevant executives can see it, because if employees or lower-level managers see all potential ratings or who is slated to succeed whom, it could cause privacy or morale issues.
- **As a Manager,** I want to know if members of my team are listed as successors for other positions or in a high-potential pool, so that I can mentor them appropriately and also be aware I might lose them to a promotion (and prepare backfills for my own team).
- **As an Employee (High Potential),** I would like to have insight into what I need to do to be ready for a higher role (even if I’m not explicitly told I’m on a succession plan, I should have a development plan that aligns to potential future roles). The system indirectly supports me by aligning my development plan to needed competencies for future roles.
- **As a Talent Development Manager,** I want to track participants in our Leadership Development Program within the system, marking them as a talent pool, and see how their performance progresses over time compared to those not in the program, so I can measure program effectiveness.
- **As an HR Admin,** I want to run a succession scenario where I remove a key person (say, simulate retirement) and see the bench strength (who’s ready, who’s almost ready) to fill that gap, basically stress-testing our succession plan through the system.
- **As an Executive,** if one of my direct reports (who holds a key role) were to leave suddenly, I want to quickly pull up the succession plan for that role on the system (possibly on my mobile device) to see who could immediately step in and what interim measures to take.

&#x20;_Example of a talent management 9-Box Grid plotting employees on **Performance** (horizontal axis) vs **Potential** (vertical axis). This tool helps in succession planning by categorizing employees (e.g., “Trusted Professionals” are high performers with lower growth potential, “High Potentials” are top right). The platform should allow such visualization to guide career and succession discussions._

## 7. Performance Reviews & Feedback Insights

_(Note: This section expands on additional requirements for performance reviews and feedback beyond the basics in Section 1, focusing on supporting **various types of reviews**, comparison tools, and generating **performance insights** useful for decisions on promotions and compensation.)_

While Section 1 covered the standard employee-manager review process, organizations often employ **multiple types of review processes** and need advanced tools to derive insights from all the collected performance data. This section addresses features such as:

- Support for **different review formats** (annual, semi-annual, project-based, peer reviews, upward reviews, etc.).
- Tools to **compare and calibrate** performance across employees or teams (beyond the calibration support already mentioned, possibly including side-by-side comparisons or rating distributions).
- **Analytics and insights** generation, such as identifying top performers for promotion or analyzing performance trends over time for an individual (improvement or decline).
- Preparing data for **promotion or compensation decisions** – e.g., rankings, or integration with compensation guidelines.

### 7.1 Various Review Types and Cycles

In addition to annual reviews, the system should handle:

- **Probationary Reviews:** New hires often get a 3-month or 6-month probation review. The system should allow setting up a review for a new employee outside the normal cycle. Ideally, when an employee is added, the system can automatically schedule a probation review form for, say, 90 days out. This review might be simpler (pass/fail or brief evaluation).
- **Project-Based Reviews:** In projectized organizations, once a project ends, they might do a review of project team members by the project leader. The platform should support ad-hoc reviews that can be initiated any time tied to a project or event, rather than on a set date for everyone. These could be shorter forms focusing on that project's goals.
- **Upward Feedback (Manager Reviews by Subordinates):** Some companies do a “manager review” where employees give feedback on their direct supervisors (often anonymously). The system should support an upward review cycle, possibly similar to 360 but focusing on leadership competencies. It could be run annually, separate from the manager’s own performance review.
- **Peer Reviews:** Apart from 360 (which is multi-rater collected by system), sometimes employees formally review peers in a structured way (especially in flat organizations or cross-functional teams). The system could support a process where an employee nominates peers to exchange reviews with on a periodic basis. This is somewhat covered by 360 though, so possibly redundant if 360 is used fully.
- **Continuous Review / Quarterly Check-ins:** Some organizations are replacing a single annual review with more frequent mini-reviews or check-ins (quarterly goals and feedback discussions). The system should be flexible to configure cycles quarterly, and maybe have a lighter-weight review form for those (and still possibly an annual summary).
- **Self-Reviews Only:** Some companies encourage periodic self-reflection without manager evaluation every time. The system might support a cycle where employees just write a self-review (which maybe manager can read, but not formally rate until a later point).

For each type, the system’s configuration of workflows and forms should be flexible to accommodate these variations. For instance, an upward feedback cycle might be initiated by HR, collects anonymous forms from employees about their managers, and then generates a summary for the manager’s development (similar to 360 but one-directional).

### 7.2 Comparison and Calibration Tools

To ensure fairness and effective decisions, managers/HR often need to **compare performance across individuals** or groups:

- **Side-by-Side Comparisons:** The platform could allow a manager to select two or more employees and see key performance data side by side. For example, compare their goal achievement percentages, average review ratings, competencies, etc. This is helpful when considering promotions or downsizing decisions.
- **Team or Department Averages:** The system can show how an employee’s rating compares to the team average or company average. E.g., “John’s overall score 4.2 vs department average 3.8”. This gives context if a manager’s ratings are lenient or harsh.
- **Rating Distribution Charts:** Provide charts in the system that show the distribution of ratings (like how many 1s, 2s, 3s in a team or company). HR can use this to ensure there’s no bias (like one department giving all high ratings, another all low). Possibly highlight outliers.
- **Forced Ranking / Stacks:** Some companies do forced ranking (though less popular now). The system might support an optional ranking feature where a manager must order their team from highest to lowest performer. This could be a private tool for calibration rather than something employees see.
- **Performance History Graphs:** For an individual, the system can chart their performance over time. If they have multiple reviews, show a trendline (did they improve, stay consistent?). Could also track how different aspects (competencies or goal achievement) changed over time. This insight helps see growth or decline patterns.
- **Cross-Comparison by Metrics:** The system could allow HR to correlate performance with other metrics like retention or engagement. E.g., filter to see if high performers are leaving or staying, or see if any correlation between engagement survey scores (if integrated) and performance ratings. This is advanced analytics but can be powerful insight.

### 7.3 Insights for Promotion and Compensation

When making promotion decisions, managers consider performance data. The platform can assist by highlighting:

- **Promotion Readiness:** If integrated with succession (section 6), the system might flag individuals who meet criteria for the next level (e.g., have X years in position, last 2 reviews above certain rating, completed necessary training). These could be flagged as “promotion-ready” in reports.
- **Multi-year High Performer:** Identify employees who, say, had top performance ratings for 3 cycles in a row – these might be strong candidates for advancement or special rewards.
- **Inconsistency or Risk Alerts:** If someone’s performance fluctuates greatly or has dropped significantly, the system could alert HR. This might influence decisions like whether to give them critical assignments or to intervene with support.
- **Comparative Rankings:** If needed for comp, a tool to rank within a department can feed into how limited bonus pools are allocated (e.g., top 20% performers get 1.5x bonus, etc.).

For **compensation**, many companies use a **merit matrix** which ties performance rating and current salary position to a raise percentage guideline. While the actual compensation planning might be done in an HRIS or comp tool, our performance platform should at least output the performance ratings and potentially recommended increase guidelines:

- For example, if an employee is rated “Exceeds”, guideline might be 4-5% increase; if “Meets”, 2-3%; if “Below”, 0-1%. These rules can be configured (see Section 11). The performance system can generate a report of recommended merit increases or bonuses based on ratings, which can be handed to the comp planning process.

Also, performance insights might guide **promotion vs lateral move** decisions – e.g., someone who is a high performer but maybe not high potential might get a different development track than someone who’s both.

The platform’s analytics module might produce a **“Talent Dashboard”** for HR with these insights (some likely appear in dashboards in section 18).

### 7.4 Functional Requirements

- **Multiple Review Cycle Configurations:** The system shall support concurrent or differing review cycles and types. Admins can configure templates and workflows for:

  - Standard Annual/Semi-Annual Reviews.
  - Probationary reviews (triggerable per hire date).
  - Project-based reviews (ad-hoc initiation for a set of participants).
  - Upward feedback cycles (collect feedback from subordinates about managers, anonymously).
  - Any other custom review (the template and participants define what it is).

- **Ad-hoc Review Initiation:** Managers (with permission) or HR shall be able to initiate a performance review for an individual or group at any time outside the normal schedule. For instance, after a project, a project leader can start brief reviews for team members. The system should still track these as separate review instances attached to those employees’ records.
- **Rating Scale Flexibility:** Some review types might use different scales (e.g., a project review might just use “Completed/Not Completed” or a simpler rating). The system shall allow each review template to have its own rating scale definitions.
- **Comparison View for Managers:** The system shall provide a feature for managers to compare their direct reports. For example, a table listing all direct reports with key data: overall performance score, goal completion %, competencies strengths/weaknesses, last promotion date, etc. The manager can sort or rank by these fields. This helps in decision-making for who gets a promotion or a big project.
- **Team Summary Reports:** The system shall allow a manager to generate a summary of their team’s performance in a given cycle (or multiple cycles) – e.g., average rating of the team, list of who exceeded vs met vs below expectations, etc. This might also be used to present in calibration meetings.
- **Cross-Team Calibration:** For calibration, HR or leadership should be able to view all employees in a certain level or job across different departments with their performance scores to ensure consistency. The system shall facilitate filtering and sorting by various attributes (e.g., compare all “Senior Engineers” across different managers with their ratings).
- **Rating Distribution Chart:** The system shall automatically produce a distribution chart of performance ratings for any given group (team, department, entire company). HR should be able to see, for instance, how many people got each rating and perhaps compare distributions by department. This is useful for ensuring consistency and might be used to enforce guidelines (like if too many “Exceeds” in one team, maybe recalibrate).
- **Forced Ranking Tool:** (If desired) The system could provide a ranking interface where a manager drags and orders their employees or assigns a rank number. This is optional, but if used, it should be stored and possibly visible only to HR/executives (not to the employees). This could complement or substitute numeric ratings.
- **Trends & History Graphs:** The system shall allow viewing an individual’s performance trend. A line or bar graph over time showing their overall rating each period, or even break it down by competency if those were scored. This helps visualize improvement or decline. Also perhaps a trend of goal achievement rates each quarter, etc.
- **Top Performer Identification:** The system shall provide the ability to query or list employees who meet certain performance criteria over time (e.g., those who scored “Exceeds” two cycles in a row). Possibly an “alert” or badge in the system could mark consistent high performers (e.g., “High Performer 2023” badge on profile).
- **Weak Performer Flag:** Similarly, if someone has consecutive low ratings, flag for HR follow-up (maybe to ensure a PIP was created). This could tie into automated suggestions: e.g., after two “Below Expectations” reviews, system suggests starting a PIP.
- **Promotion Suggestions:** The system itself might not automatically suggest promotions (that’s a managerial decision), but it can highlight those who are in highest performance tier or who have “Ready for promotion” status from succession. For instance, an HR report might highlight: Employee X – high performer, in High Potential pool, 3 years in current role – likely ready for next step.
- **Integration to Compensation Module:** The performance system shall be able to export or provide performance ratings and potentially recommended increase factors to a compensation planning system. If the compensation planning is done within this system (see Section 11 for rules), then it will directly use performance data to compute bonuses/merit. If external, then a structured export (like CSV of employee, rating, recommendation) should be available.
- **Custom Analytics Queries:** HR power users might want to do custom queries on performance data, e.g., check if there is rater bias (one manager always gives higher scores than peer managers). The system should allow retrieval of such insights – either through built-in reports or an ad-hoc reporting tool where HR can filter by manager and see average scores, etc. (Ad-hoc reporting is covered in section 17 too).
- **Crosstab Reports:** The system shall support creating cross-tabulated reports combining multiple criteria. For example: a matrix of performance rating by department by year. Or performance vs engagement. Or performance vs tenure. These can yield insights like maybe new hires perform lower initially, etc., which can inform HR strategy. (This might fall under advanced reporting, but it's an insight generation so mention here.)
- **Integration of Engagement/Other Data:** If the platform can integrate employee engagement survey results or 360 feedback scores, it could correlate those with performance. E.g., an insight: high engagement teams tend to have higher performance. While not core to performance management, having an open analytics platform allows these insights.
- **Data Visualization and Dashboards:** Many of these insights (distributions, trends, comparisons) could be part of the **dashboarding** capabilities. Indeed, Section 18 (Dashboards) will cover some of this. But ensuring the platform can visualize these in easy charts within the UI is important so that users (managers/HR) can quickly glean insights without exporting to Excel.
- **Printing and Sharing:** If a manager wants to discuss a team’s performance distribution with their boss, the system should allow printing that chart or sharing a link (with security) to an interactive report.

### 7.5 User Stories

- **As an HR Admin,** I want to set up a special review form for new hires at the 90-day mark, so that managers complete a probationary review and the system tracks if new employees are meeting expectations early on.
- **As a Project Manager,** I want to initiate performance reviews for my project team at the conclusion of the project, so I can evaluate and give feedback specific to that project and have it recorded for their managers to see.
- **As a Department Head,** I want to receive upward feedback from all employees about their managers annually, so I can identify any leadership issues or great managers, and use that information in manager development (or even performance evaluations of managers).
- **As a Manager,** I want to compare the performance of my team members easily, so that when deciding on who gets the highest bonus or who is ready for more responsibility, I have objective data (goals completed, ratings, etc.) to base it on rather than gut feel.
- **As a Manager,** I want to see a chart of my team's performance ratings distribution after I do reviews, so I can ensure I'm not being too lenient or harsh and adjust before finalizing if needed (especially if HR expects an approximate normal distribution).
- **As a Senior Manager in calibration,** I want to view all the managers in my unit and the average ratings they gave their teams, so that I can talk to outliers (like someone who rated everyone as exceptional) to calibrate standards across the unit.
- **As an HR Analyst,** I want to identify employees who have had declining performance for two years, so that we can proactively work with their managers on improvement or succession planning if they're in key roles.
- **As an Executive,** I want to know who my consistent star performers are across the company (those who year after year are top-rated), so that we can ensure they are recognized, rewarded, and not at risk of leaving.
- **As an HR Partner,** I want a tool that allows me to rank all employees in a certain job level by performance easily, so that when allocating a limited bonus pool or deciding promotions, we have a clear prioritized list based on merit.
- **As a Manager,** I want to look at a single employee’s profile and see their last few years of performance reviews and goal achievements in a chart, so I can have an informed conversation about their career progression and maybe justify a promotion for them.
- **As a Compensation Manager,** I want to export a spreadsheet of all employees with their final performance ratings and their recommended merit increase percentages (based on our guidelines), so that I can load it into our compensation system and managers can review and adjust within budget.
- **As an HR Executive,** I want to analyze whether our performance ratings align with promotions and turnover. For example, see if high performers are indeed getting promoted, and if low performers are more likely to leave or be managed out, as an effectiveness check of our performance management process.
- **As a Manager,** I want to conduct a semi-formal quarterly check-in with each employee, and have that recorded (maybe just a short form or even just goals update), so that I and the employee have a mid-point reference before the big annual review. The system should support this with minimal overhead.
- **As a Data-Driven HR Team,** we want the system to yield insights such as “Team A consistently has higher performance outcomes than Team B – why is that?” which might hint at better management or resources in Team A. While root cause is outside system, the data highlight is something we'd get from comparative reports in the system.

## 8. Compensation Management Integration

A robust performance management system not only evaluates performance but also supports linking those evaluations to **compensation decisions**. This section details how the platform handles **compensation management** aspects, particularly merit increases and bonuses tied to performance.

While full compensation systems can be complex, our focus is on the rules and processes around **merit pay** (salary increases based on performance) and **performance-based bonuses**. The platform should allow defining **customizable rules** that translate performance ratings (and possibly other factors) into compensation recommendations. It may also facilitate the compensation review process, or at least output needed data to whatever system processes pay changes.

### 8.1 Description

**Merit Increase Planning:** Often after performance reviews are completed, organizations enter a compensation planning phase. Each employee’s raise is determined by their performance rating and their current salary position in range. Many use a **merit matrix** (also called a salary increase guideline matrix) which has performance ratings on one axis and position-in-grade (or compa-ratio, etc.) on the other, and each cell has a recommended raise percentage (or range).

For example, a simplified merit matrix:

- High Performer (Rating 5): if below midpoint salary, 5-6% increase; if at midpoint, 4-5%; if above midpoint, 3-4%.
- Solid Performer (Rating 3): if below midpoint, 3-4%; at midpoint, 2-3%; above midpoint, 1-2%.
- Low Performer (Rating 1): typically 0% (no raise or very minimal).
  _(Midpoint refers to the midpoint of their salary range or a compa-ratio \~1.0)_.

The platform should allow an admin to configure these rules (e.g., by inputting such a matrix or formula). Using those rules and each employee’s performance result, it can compute a **recommended merit increase** or merit percentage for each employee. Managers might then adjust within a budget.

**Bonus Planning:** Similarly, if annual bonuses are tied to performance rating or goal achievement, rules can be set. For example, “High performers get 150% of target bonus, average get 100%, low get 50%” etc. The platform can calculate recommended bonus payouts if target bonus info is available (which might be input from HRIS or manually).

The platform may not execute the payroll changes, but it can serve as a **worksheet for managers** to propose pay changes. Ideally, managers could see all their team’s performance ratings and the system’s suggested raise, and then they can adjust within allowed bounds or budgets.

**Budgeting:** The system might allow HR to allocate a budget (e.g., 3% of payroll for increases) to each department. As managers input final decisions, it can show if they are over/under budget.

**Approval Workflow:** If comp changes are done in the system, it should implement an approval chain (e.g., manager submits increases, next level approves, HR final approves). Alternatively, if comp is handled outside, at least the system should produce the needed data to feed into that process.

**Customization:** Every company’s comp rules differ. The system must be flexible to define rules:

- Could be formulaic: e.g., “Merit % = some base + multiplier \* performance score”.
- Or matrix-based: piecewise guidance like above.
- Possibly separate guidelines by country or employee category (the system should allow multiple sets of rules if needed).
- Rounding rules or minimum/maximum constraints (e.g., no one gets over 10% raise without special approval).

**Communication of Results:** Some systems can generate the letters or messages to employees about their increase once finalized. Or at least store what final decisions were for record.

**Pay-for-Performance Analytics:** Post-comp planning, HR might analyze if high performers got bigger raises as intended (to ensure meritocracy). The system’s data can help with that: correlation between rating and % increase, etc.

### 8.2 Functional Requirements

- **Merit Rule Configuration:** The system shall allow HR to configure merit increase guidelines. This could be in the form of a matrix with performance rating categories vs. salary position (like compa-ratio or quartile). HR should be able to define rating categories (e.g., “Exceeds”, “Meets”, etc.) and for each category and possibly each salary range bucket, assign a recommended increase percentage or range. If the company uses a simpler approach (just by rating, regardless of range), it should handle that too (just one column matrix).
- **Integration with Salary Data:** To apply compensation rules, the system needs current salary info and possibly salary grade midpoint or compa-ratio. If the performance system is separate from HRIS, we’ll import that data (via API or file). The system should store each employee’s current salary, their grade range or compa-ratio if available, and their target bonus % if relevant. This data likely comes from HRIS; the system should update it periodically or allow a one-time data upload during comp planning.
- **Merit Recommendation Calculation:** After performance ratings are finalized, the system shall calculate a **recommended merit increase** (percent and/or new salary) for each employee based on the configured rules. These recommendations should be visible to managers in a compensation planning view.
- **Bonus Recommendation Calculation:** Similarly, if provided a target bonus amount or percentage for each employee, the system shall calculate a recommended actual bonus payout. For example, if an employee’s target bonus is \$10k (say 10% of salary) and they are a top performer (150% payout per policy), recommended payout = \$15k. This requires target bonus info as input.
- **Manager Compensation Planning Interface:** The system shall provide an interface for managers to review and adjust compensation for their team:

  - List of team members with current salary, performance rating, recommended increase %, recommended new salary, recommended bonus, etc.
  - The manager can override the recommended % within allowed limits or give a different amount, perhaps with a justification note if outside guideline.
  - The interface should show the total budget vs used as the manager makes changes (e.g., sum of all increases vs allocated budget amount in \$ or %).
  - Real-time validation: If a manager tries to exceed budget or give an out-of-guideline increase, highlight it or prevent submission until resolved or justified.

- **Hierarchical Roll-up:** A higher-level manager should be able to see combined data for their whole organization (sum of budgets and used, etc.). They might adjust some directs of their sub-managers if needed (depending on process, maybe only send back for revisions).
- **Approval Workflow:** The system shall allow a workflow where once a manager finalizes their compensation decisions, it goes to their manager and/or HR for approval. This might be a simple status tracking or a formal approve/reject with comments mechanism. There should be a way to lock changes after final approval to maintain a record.
- **Audit Trail:** All changes to recommended amounts should be logged (who changed what, when). This is important for audit and to handle any discrepancies or later questions.
- **Different Plans for Different Groups:** If the company has different comp processes for different employee groups (e.g., hourly vs salaried, or different countries have different cycles), the system shall support parallel planning sessions or separate rule sets. For example, US employees merit cycle in March with one matrix, Europe in April with another matrix due to different inflation contexts.
- **Lump Sum Calculation:** If someone is at top of range (max salary), companies often give a lump-sum bonus instead of raise. The rules might specify that if recommended raise would take someone above max, anything above max becomes a lump sum (one-time payment). The system should handle such scenarios by calculating accordingly and flagging those cases.
- **Employee Communication Prep:** The system shall allow HR to generate communications. Notably, after finalizing comp, HR could mail merge letters: “Your new salary is X, effective Y date, which includes a X% merit increase.” The system can store those templates and fill in fields from the data. Even if it doesn’t send them (that might be via HRIS), being able to generate them is useful.
- **Security:** Compensation data is highly sensitive. The system must ensure that managers can only see their own team’s data and not others. Also, while performance data might be more open, salary data must be tightly controlled. Likely only managers and HR have access to comp planning screens, not all users. Possibly even within HR, some may not see salary details if not needed. Fine-grained control is required.
- **Data Export:** After the planning is done, the system shall export the finalized compensation changes to payroll or HRIS. This could be a file with employee ID, new salary, bonus amount, effective date, etc., or ideally an API integration to update HRIS records. The export should be secure and properly formatted.
- **Historical Comp Data:** The system might keep a record of past merit increases and bonuses. This can tie into performance analytics (e.g., see if someone with high performance was rewarded accordingly last cycle). It’s useful for managers to see last merit percent given, etc., when deciding current. If integrated with HRIS, maybe just display last increase from HRIS data. If not, store from the last cycle’s usage.
- **Compensation Dashboard:** Perhaps an HR dashboard to monitor progress of comp planning: how many managers submitted, how budgets are shaping up, any anomalies (like someone with low rating being given high raise, etc.).
- **Equity and Bias Checks:** Optionally, the system could help HR analyze proposed comp outcomes for potential biases. E.g., ensure that on average high performers get more than low, and check by demographics if needed (this is advanced and sensitive, but some analytics might highlight if there’s an outlier scenario).
- **Integration with Performance:** All of this comp planning module should seamlessly pull in the performance ratings from the review module so that once reviews are done, comp planning is ready to go without manual data entry.

### 8.3 User Stories

- **As an HR Compensation Manager,** I want to configure our merit increase guidelines (the matrix of performance vs salary range position), so that the system can automatically suggest raises that are in line with our compensation strategy.
- **As an HRIS Specialist,** I want the performance management system to import each employee’s current salary, grade, and compa-ratio from our core HR system, so that the compensation calculations are based on up-to-date and accurate data.
- **As a Line Manager,** after completing performance reviews, I want to see the system’s recommended salary increase for each of my team members based on their rating, so that I have a starting point that is fair and consistent.
- **As a Line Manager,** I want to adjust some of the recommended increases (within allowed limits) to better allocate my fixed budget – for example, I might give a bit more to an extremely high performer and a bit less to a just-above-average performer – and I want the system to show me my budget impact as I do so.
- **As a Department Head,** I want to approve or adjust the aggregated merit proposals from my subordinate managers, so that the overall department increases make sense and we stay within the department budget.
- **As a CFO or HR Head,** I want to ensure the total company-wide increase pool does not exceed what we planned (say 3% of total payroll), and the system should give me real-time totals and allow me to drill in if a certain division is over-budget before finalizing.
- **As an HR Partner,** I want to ensure that low performers are not being granted large increases, so the system should flag if any proposed increase is outside of the guideline for a given performance rating, and require justification or approval for that.
- **As an HR Admin,** I want to generate letters for each employee after the cycle, confirming their new salary and bonus, so that I can distribute these to managers for communication or upload them to our HRIS.
- **As a Country HR Manager,** I need to use a different merit matrix for my country due to different market conditions, so I want the system to allow multiple sets of rules and apply the correct one based on employee’s location or grade.
- **As a Compensation Analyst,** I want to export the final approved merit increases and bonuses to a file (or system) that will be used for payroll processing, so that we can pay out the new salaries and bonuses accurately and on time.
- **As an HR Executive,** I want to analyze the outcome of the merit cycle to ensure high performers got meaningfully higher increases than others, confirming that our pay-for-performance philosophy is working. The system’s data should let me produce a report of average increase by performance rating, for example.
- **As an HR Compliance Officer,** I want an audit trail of who approved each raise and any exceptions granted, so that if questions arise later (e.g., an employee complains about a low increase), we have documented reasoning and approvals to reference.
- **As a Manager,** I want to be absolutely sure that my team’s salary info is kept confidential in the performance system, so only I (and appropriate higher-ups) can see it, and not, for example, my employees or other peers. The system interface should clearly separate what is shared (performance feedback) vs what is private (salary planning).
- **As a Business Line Head,** I might decide on a special adjustment for a critical employee (outside the normal merit cycle, e.g., a mid-year increase to retain them). If possible, I’d like the system to record that too (maybe as ad-hoc comp change linked to performance justification) so that performance and compensation history stay connected.
- **As a Compensation Planner,** I want to be able to model a scenario – e.g., what if we up the budget to 4% – and see how recommended increases might change. (This is advanced scenario planning; at minimum perhaps changing the matrix or budget number and recalculating.)

## 9. Platform Configuration & Customization

A key strength of a SaaS platform is adaptability. This section details how the platform will offer **extensive customization capabilities**, allowing administrators to configure **custom objects, fields, rules, calculations, and views** without requiring code changes. This flexibility ensures the product can meet unique business needs and evolve with the organization.

### 9.1 Description

Out-of-the-box, the platform provides standard entities like Employee, Goals, Reviews, etc., each with pre-defined attributes. However, organizations often have custom requirements:

- Additional fields in forms (e.g., a custom competency unique to the company).
- Custom objects: maybe track something like “Performance Improvement Task” or a “Mentoring Agreement” as a distinct object not originally provided.
- Custom calculations: perhaps a special performance score that is a weighted formula of goal score (60%) and competency score (40%), or a custom rating normalization formula.
- Custom rules/logic: e.g., automatically set review cycle based on employee type, or a rule that if an employee is rated “Unsatisfactory”, then a follow-up review is scheduled in 3 months.
- Custom workflows: some organizations might want an extra approval step or an alternate sequence of events.
- Custom views/reports: being able to tailor what data columns or charts appear on a manager’s dashboard.

**Configuration vs. Custom Code:** We aim for these to be achievable through configuration (admin settings) rather than requiring the product team to implement a one-off change. This means a user-friendly admin interface for customizing forms, fields, and business logic.

### 9.2 Functional Requirements

- **Custom Fields:** The system shall allow administrators to add custom fields to major objects/entities (such as employee profile, review forms, goal records, feedback entries, etc.). For example, HR might add a field “Potential Rating” on the employee profile if it wasn’t there, or “Employee Engagement Score” to correlate with performance. Custom fields should support various data types (text, number, date, dropdown selection, boolean, etc.). Admins should be able to place these fields in UI forms (like adding a section in the performance review form for a custom question).
- **Custom Sections in Forms:** Specifically for performance review forms and feedback forms, the system must provide a form builder or template editor (likely drag-and-drop or similar). Admins can create sections (like “Section: Company Values Assessment”) and add questions or rating fields. They should be able to specify field properties (e.g., a rating field out of 5, or a text comment field with character limit) and whether it’s for employee, manager, or both to fill out.
- **Custom Rating Scales:** Allow admin to define their own rating scales (beyond numeric). For example, a company might use “Outstanding/Good/Needs Improvement” instead of 1-5. The system should let them label the scale and map those to internal numeric values if needed for calculation.
- **Custom Calculations/Formula Fields:** The platform shall allow defining calculated fields. For example, an “Overall Score” that automatically calculates as an average of sub-section scores in a review, or a “Goal completion percentage” that averages multiple goal percentages. Admins should be able to set formulas using available fields (like a simple expression builder). Possibly not as advanced as Excel, but at least weighted averages and sums.
- **Custom Workflows/Rules:** The system shall provide a way to configure business rules. For instance:

  - Trigger certain actions on events (like after a review is submitted, trigger an email or trigger creation of a follow-up goal).
  - Conditional logic: e.g., if an employee’s rating is below X, then send a notification to HR or automatically create a PIP record.
  - Ability to change process flows: e.g., whether a second-level manager approval is required can be toggled, or adding a step where employees can appeal a review (just as an example).
    This could be through a workflow editor where certain steps can be turned on/off or conditions added.

- **Custom Objects/Modules:** The platform’s architecture should allow new object definitions if needed. For example, say a company wants to track “Certifications” as part of performance (not originally a module). Ideally, the admin could create a new object “Certification” with fields (Name, Date acquired, etc.), relate it to employees, and then use the reporting engine to include it. This is advanced and often only seen in very flexible platforms (like Salesforce’s custom objects concept). We might not fully allow arbitrary objects, but at least allow extensions to existing objects and maybe a few generic placeholders.
- **Custom Views & Layouts:** Admins (or even end users with settings) should be able to configure list views or dashboard widgets. For instance, on the Goals page, choose which columns to display or filter by. Or create a saved view “My team’s goals due this quarter”. On dashboards, maybe select which widgets (if many available) appear for a user role. Essentially, not hardcoding the UI for everyone, but offering configuration of layouts within some limits.
- **Role-Based Views/Fields:** Some fields or forms might be relevant only to certain groups. The system shall allow making custom fields or sections visible/editable only to certain roles. E.g., a custom field “Flight Risk” might be something only HR sees, not managers or employees. Or a special section for executives.
- **Localization of Custom Elements:** If the platform supports multiple languages, any custom fields or text added by admin should be localizable (the admin should be able to provide translations for field labels, etc.).
- **Custom Notifications/Emails:** The system shall allow customizing the content of email templates for notifications (like the text of “It’s time for your review” email). Also, enabling/disabling certain notifications or adding new ones (maybe if a custom workflow step is added, an email for it).
- **Custom Roles and Permissions:** Beyond just user roles, allow creation of new roles or permission sets. For example, if they want a “Mentor” role that can only see some development plan info but not everything else. The system should have a roles management interface where new roles can be defined and specific permissions toggled (like can view X, can edit Y, cannot see Z). This ties to Section 15 but is part of customization.
- **Custom Integration Fields:** If expecting integration (section 13), the admin might need to map fields to external systems. The platform should allow exposing custom fields via API and mapping them if needed. For instance, if an external LMS integration needs to store a course completion date in the performance system, a custom field might capture that.
- **UI Branding and Customization:** The platform should allow basic theming – uploading company logo, choosing color scheme, perhaps adding custom help text or links (like a link to company’s performance management policy) on pages. While not exactly objects/fields, it’s part of making the SaaS product feel tailored to the company.
- **Custom Reports & Dashboards:** (Though covered in reporting section, mention here that the admin or power users should be able to create custom reports/dashboards selecting which fields and filters they want, including any custom fields added.) The system should incorporate those seamlessly.
- **Custom Import/Export Templates:** If they add custom fields, the import/export of data (like CSV of goals) should include those fields. Possibly allow mapping external data to custom fields.
- **Testing Sandbox:** Since customization can be complex, the platform should ideally offer a sandbox or test environment where admins can try out new customizations (like new forms or rules) without affecting production data, then promote changes once verified. At least, a preview mode for forms and maybe simulation of a rule.
- **Documentation of Customizations:** The system should maintain a log or documentation of what customizations have been made (for admin reference and for troubleshooting with vendor support if needed). E.g., list of all custom fields and their details, list of active custom rules, etc.

### 9.3 User Stories

- **As a System Admin,** I want to add a new field “Mentor Assigned” to the employee profile so that I can track who is mentoring each employee as part of our development program. I should be able to do this through the admin UI without calling the vendor.
- **As an HR Admin,** I want to modify the annual review form to include a section rating employees on our five core values, with each value having a dropdown rating and comment field, because this is unique to our company culture.
- **As an HR Admin,** I want to change the labels of the performance rating scale from numeric 1-5 to descriptive terms (“Outstanding, Exceeds, Meets, etc.”) to match our HR terminology, so that managers see familiar language.
- **As an HR Policy Owner,** I need to enforce that any employee receiving the lowest rating automatically triggers a follow-up review in 3 months. I want to configure a rule in the system that if a review is submitted with rating = “1 - Unsatisfactory”, a new “Follow-up Review” task is created for 3 months later and HR is notified.
- **As an HRIS Analyst,** I want to integrate a new data point from our HRIS (e.g., an employee’s “Risk of Exit” score from an AI tool) into the performance platform, so I create a custom field in the performance system to store that score and map it through the API. Then I can include it in talent reviews or reporting.
- **As a Manager,** I want to filter the goals view to only show my team’s “stretch goals” (we have a custom checkbox for stretch goals that HR added), so that I can focus discussion on those. The system should allow me to create a custom view or filter by that custom field.
- **As a Performance Program Manager,** I want to tweak the workflow of our mid-year review: specifically, I want employees to set goals, then managers approve them, then at mid-year they do a light check-in. The system didn't originally have a separate “goal approval” step, so I configure a custom workflow to insert an approval stage after goal setting and before mid-year check-in.
- **As a System Admin,** I want to create a new user role called “Division HR” which has access to view all performance reviews and succession info for their division only (not whole company), which is more granular than the default roles. I should be able to assign permissions like “view reviews in Department X” to this role.
- **As an Employee,** I want the system interface to reflect our company branding (logo, colors) and terminology (for example, we call performance reviews “Growth Conversations”), so that it feels like a cohesive internal tool. The admin should be able to change labels and upload our logo to the interface.
- **As an Administrator,** I want to test a new performance review template (with some new fields and logic) in a sandbox environment before rolling it out, so I can ensure it works as expected and doesn't disrupt current data.
- **As a Talent Analyst,** I want to create a custom report that shows, for each employee, their performance rating, potential rating (a custom field we added), and engagement survey score (from an integration, stored in a custom field) all together, so that we can analyze correlations. The reporting tool should let me select these custom fields and produce the report without needing engineering help.
- **As a System Admin,** I need to document all customizations we've done to the system for compliance and future reference. I would like the system to provide an export or list of custom fields, custom forms, and active custom rules/workflows.
- **As an HR Admin,** if our process changes (say we add a new core value or change a goal weight formula), I want to be able to update the system configuration easily (add the new value field, or adjust the formula for overall score calculation) rather than waiting for a software update.
- **As a Local HR Admin in a subsidiary,** I want to have a custom performance form for our region (due to different regulatory requirements for feedback wording, etc.). The system should allow multiple templates and I can assign that template to employees of my region.

## 10. Integration and API Capabilities

Modern HR tech stacks are interconnected. This section outlines the platform’s **API and integration capabilities**, enabling it to exchange data with other software (HRIS, LMS, ATS, etc.) and fit seamlessly into an organization’s existing infrastructure.

The platform should provide a robust **RESTful API** (and/or GraphQL) for common operations, secure and documented for customer developers to use. Additionally, it should support specific integrations or connectors for popular systems in the HR domain. We cover inbound data (getting data into the performance system), outbound (sending data out), and possibly real-time integration (webhooks).

### 10.1 Description

**Key Integrations:**

- **HRIS (Human Resource Information System):** Usually the source of truth for employee data. The performance platform should integrate with HRIS (like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle HCM, BambooHR, etc.) to import employees, their departments, managers, job titles, hire dates (for probation review triggers), and so on. Ideally, changes in HRIS (new hires, terminations, manager changes) sync to the performance system automatically (e.g., daily sync or real-time via webhooks).
- **SSO (Single Sign-On):** Not data but access – integrating with corporate SSO (SAML or OAuth providers like Azure AD, Okta) to allow users to log in with their corporate credentials.
- **Email/Calendar:** Integration with email/calendaring (Outlook, Google) to sync meetings (like 1:1s scheduled) or to send calendar invites for review deadlines, etc.
- **LMS (Learning Management System):** To link development plans to courses. E.g., if a development plan says take course X, the performance system could talk to the LMS to enroll the user or at least mark when completed. Possibly two-way: performance sends required learning, LMS returns completion status.
- **Compensation Systems:** After performance, data might go to a comp tool (if not handled within). Or if within, maybe integration to payroll for final payouts.
- **ATS (Applicant Tracking System):** Possibly to import goals or assessment of new hires? Not directly needed, except maybe pulling objectives from onboarding.
- **Collaboration Tools (Slack/Teams):** For continuous feedback integration - e.g., send a Slack message to give quick feedback that logs in system, or reminders delivered via these channels.
- **Engagement/Survey Tools:** Some companies use separate engagement survey tools; integration could allow pulling engagement scores into performance profiles, as mentioned earlier for analysis.
- **Reporting/BI Tools:** If company uses a central BI, the performance data could be piped to a data warehouse or BI tool via API for advanced analytics beyond what’s built-in.
- **Other Talent Systems:** Perhaps integration with an Applicant Tracking System for internal mobility, or with a skills inventory tool.

**API Capabilities:** The platform’s API should allow:

- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on core objects: employees, goals, feedback entries, review forms & results, etc.
- Authentication methods (likely OAuth2 for API usage).
- Pagination, filtering for reading lists (e.g., get all goals updated after a certain date).
- Webhooks or event subscriptions: e.g., the system can send an event to external systems when a review is completed or when a goal is updated.
- Rate limiting for performance but enough throughput for typical batch jobs (like syncing a thousand employees).
- API documentation and maybe an API explorer interface.

**Integration Middleware and Pre-built Connectors:** It might be beneficial if the system has out-of-the-box connectors (like an integration that can be configured for Workday to pull certain fields). Or at least reference implementations.
Possibly support for integration platforms like Zapier or Microsoft Power Automate for simpler connections (though those might not handle heavy HR data well, but could for something like automatically posting a Slack message when an objective is completed).

**Data Import/Export:** Provide CSV or Excel import/export for cases where API integration is not set up. E.g., HR can bulk import goal data or results if needed, or export all review data for analysis.

**Security & Compliance:** Ensure API data transfer is secure (HTTPS, possibly IP whitelisting or signed requests). Privacy compliance when integrating (like ensure only necessary personal data is synced).

### 10.2 Functional Requirements

- **Employee Data Sync:** The platform shall integrate with primary HRIS to automatically import and update employee records (name, email, job, manager, location, etc.). This sync should run on a schedule (e.g., nightly) and on-demand, and handle new hires (creating accounts), changes (updating manager relationships), and terminations (could deactivate accounts or mark them ineligible for review).
- **SSO Integration:** The system shall support SAML 2.0 or OAuth2 SSO to integrate with enterprise identity providers. This allows one-click login and ensures user account provisioning can be Just-In-Time or managed from the IDP.
- **Directory and Org Chart API:** Provide APIs to retrieve organizational hierarchy (or reflect HRIS's). So if a company has a custom intranet, they could query our system for an org chart including performance data if needed.
- **Goals API:** The system shall offer API endpoints to create, read, update, delete goals. This could allow other systems (like a project management tool or OKR software if any) to push or pull goals. For example, if an OKR tool is used by top management, it might push company objectives into our system to align employees’ goals.
- **Feedback and Review API:** Endpoints to fetch an employee’s performance reviews (maybe read-only for external analytics usage, due to sensitivity). Or to create feedback entries (say if integrated with Slack, a Slack app calls an API to create a feedback entry).
- **Development Plan API:** Access to development plan items, possibly to sync with external learning systems (LMS could query which development goals an employee has, and mark something complete when course done, or vice versa).
- **Compensation API:** Perhaps to export performance ratings and comp recommendations to a comp system – maybe just an endpoint to fetch finalized ratings for all employees in a cycle. Or if integrated, an endpoint to post back final salary numbers if needed.
- **Webhooks/Event Notifications:** The system shall support registering webhooks for certain events. E.g., when a performance review is completed, send a JSON payload to a specified endpoint. Or when a new goal is created, etc. This allows external systems to react (like notify a Slack channel, or update an HR dashboard).
- **Import/Export Tools:** For systems without full API integration, the platform shall allow CSV import for key data. For example: bulk import of employee data (if API not used), bulk import of historical performance records (for initial implementation), bulk goal import (maybe from spreadsheet if planning offline). Similarly, allow exporting data (reviews, goals, etc.) to CSV/Excel for analysis or backup.
- **Pre-built Connectors:** If feasible, the vendor will provide connectors or an integration hub for popular systems:

  - e.g., a Workday connector that pulls worker data via Workday’s API using minimal configuration (just credentials and field mapping).
  - a BambooHR connector (since smaller companies often use that) where hooking up API keys syncs employees.
  - Integration with Microsoft Active Directory/Azure AD for user provisioning and SSO (which covers SSO and can also fill profile info).
  - Perhaps a plug-in for Microsoft Teams that surfaces some performance data or allows giving praise from Teams (just an idea, as integration).

- **API Security & Access:** The system’s API must require secure authentication (likely OAuth2 tokens for integrations). There should be a way to create API service accounts or tokens with specific scopes (e.g., a token that only allows reading data vs one that can write). All API traffic must be over HTTPS. Possibly provide IP whitelisting for added security on API keys.
- **API Documentation:** The vendor shall provide thorough API documentation, ideally interactive (like a Swagger/OpenAPI UI) so developers can see endpoints and try sample calls. Also, provide example code snippets in common languages for how to integrate.
- **Rate Limits and Performance:** The API should handle reasonable load. For example, if pulling 10,000 employees, provide pagination and let's say allow maybe 1000 records per call or something. Document any rate limits (like X calls per minute) to avoid overload. Possibly allow batch calls.
- **Data Consistency & Timing:** Document the timing expectations for sync. e.g., if HRIS triggers an immediate change, do we near-real-time reflect it or next day? Possibly allow HRIS to call our API to update immediately when something changes (push model) rather than waiting for our scheduled pull.
- **Integration Logging:** The system should log integration activities for troubleshooting. If an API call fails or a webhook fails, there should be an admin view or log file where an admin or support can see what went wrong. Also, track last sync times and number of records updated, etc., to verify things are working.
- **Integration with Outlook/Calendar:** Through API or native integration, allow adding calendar events for scheduled reviews or 1:1s. For example, when a manager schedules a review meeting in the system, it could send a meeting invite via Outlook/Exchange integration. Or at least, allow exporting a calendar ICS file for the event.
- **Integration with Slack/Teams:** Provide optional integration where, for instance, a Slack bot can be used to give feedback: “/givefeedback @john Great job on the presentation!” which calls our API to log it and maybe returns a confirmation. Or push notifications to Slack: “Reminder: You have a performance review due”. If not building ourselves, ensure API can be used by a custom Slack app to do these actions.
- **Data Privacy Considerations:** If transferring data between systems, ensure compliance (like for EU, ensure appropriate data processing agreements if using SaaS). Possibly support using employee IDs instead of personal info in some integrations to limit PII flow (depending on requirement).
- **Scalability for large orgs:** Integration should handle thousands of employees. Eg, if Workday is the source, pulling an entire feed of 50k employees might be needed – ensure the API or integration approach can manage that in a timely manner (maybe using a file feed or robust API calls).

### 10.3 User Stories

- **As an IT Integrator,** I want to automatically provision users and update reporting structure in the performance platform by syncing from our HR system (Workday), so that we don’t have to manually manage employee data in two places and new hires can seamlessly begin using the system.
- **As an HR Admin,** when a manager changes in the HRIS, I want that to reflect in the performance system quickly, so that the new manager gains access to the employee's performance records and upcoming reviews, and the old manager loses it.
- **As an Employee,** I want to log into the performance system using the same credentials as my other work apps (via SSO), so I don’t have to remember another password and login is secure.
- **As a Learning & Development Manager,** I want the development goals in the performance system to connect with our Learning Management System; for example, if someone’s development plan includes “Complete Project Management Course,” when they finish that in the LMS it should mark the goal complete in the performance system.
- **As a Manager,** I use Outlook for my calendar – if I schedule a 1:1 or review meeting in the performance platform, I want it to appear on both our Outlook calendars automatically, saving me the duplicate entry.
- **As a Team Lead,** I use Slack heavily; I’d love to quickly give feedback via a Slack command, and for the performance system to capture it so it counts in continuous feedback. (e.g., “/praise @Alice for helping me debug the code issue”).
- **As an HR Analyst,** I want to pull all performance data (ratings, goals, etc.) into our central data warehouse to run analyses and cross-check with other data (like attrition, engagement). The performance system’s API should let me extract all that information programmatically in batches (or even stream changes via webhooks).
- **As an Administrator,** I need to ensure the integration jobs run smoothly. I want a dashboard or log that shows when the last HRIS sync ran, how many records were updated, and any errors (like an employee in HRIS not found in the performance system because of missing mapping), so I can troubleshoot quickly if something is wrong.
- **As an HR Manager,** when we finish performance reviews, I want to send performance ratings to our compensation planning system (which might be another module or external). The system should allow me to export or API transfer each employee’s finalized rating and perhaps goal achievement metrics to that system.
- **As an IT Security Officer,** I want to ensure that the API of the performance system is secure and that only authorized systems can access it. I’d use API keys or OAuth clients with specific scopes, and perhaps restrict by IP or require mutual TLS as needed. I also want to see logs of API access for auditing.
- **As a New Customer implementing the platform,** I want to import historical performance reviews from our legacy system via CSV or API, so that we have continuity and can see past years’ data in the new platform. The import tool should allow mapping fields and uploading those records.
- **As a Talent Development Specialist,** I want to integrate our mentoring platform – if an employee gets assigned a mentor there, I'd like that info to update in the performance system (maybe as a custom field or note in their development plan) via API, to have a unified view of all development activities.
- **As a Workflow Automation Specialist,** I want to use something like Zapier or Power Automate to create a simple rule: whenever a goal is marked 100% in the performance system, automatically post a congratulations in a Teams channel. The performance system having webhooks or integration endpoints would enable this neat automation.
- **As an HR Data Privacy Officer,** I want to ensure that if an employee requests their data or deletion (GDPR, etc.), the integrations respect that. So if I delete or anonymize data in HRIS and performance system, any downstream storage via API in other systems is handled by that system’s compliance but we need a clear understanding of data flow through APIs to manage those obligations.

## 11. Internationalization and Localization

In a global organization, the performance management platform must support **internationalization (i18n)** to cater to users in different regions. This includes multiple **languages**, **currencies**, date/time formats, and other locale-specific configurations. Additionally, it should handle region-specific requirements (like different workweek schedules or local legal requirements for performance documentation where applicable).

### 11.1 Description

**Language Support:** Users should be able to use the platform in their preferred language. All UI elements, emails, and notifications should be translatable. The platform likely provides several language packs (common ones: English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, etc.) out of the box, and the ability to add translations for custom content (like custom field labels or help text). Users might choose their language, or it's set by their profile/region.

**Currency:** If the system shows monetary values (particularly in compensation planning), it needs to display currency appropriate to the region. For example, in merit planning, a UK manager should see salaries in GBP with proper formatting, a European in EUR, etc. The system should store numeric values in a standard format (maybe minor units or something) but display with appropriate currency symbol and formatting. It might allow multiple currencies if a manager has a global team (some systems let user switch or show currency converted to a chosen currency for consistency). Possibly integrate with exchange rates if needed to roll-up budgets (or simply handle each currency separately).

**Date and Number Formats:** The platform should display dates in the user's locale format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY vs DD/MM/YYYY, etc.) and times in their local time zone. If scheduling events, account for time zone differences, e.g., a review meeting between a US manager and European employee must consider time zones. The system should allow each user a time zone setting, used for notifications (so due date "end of day" respects local end of day, etc.). Numbers (like 1,000.50 vs 1.000,50 formatting) should adapt per locale.

**Multi-Language Content:** The content of performance reviews and feedback might also involve multiple languages. The system itself won't translate user-entered comments (that’s beyond scope), but it should allow people to input text in various scripts (so Unicode support for data). Also, ensure features like search or reports handle non-Latin characters.

**Local Calendar/Holidays:** Possibly consider different weekend days or public holidays if scheduling deadlines (for example, in the Middle East the weekend might be Friday-Saturday). The system might not need complex holiday awareness, but at least avoid scheduling default due dates on weekends or allow adjusting by region.

**Regulatory Localization:** Some countries have legal requirements on performance evaluations. For example, works councils in some European countries might need to approve processes, or in France, certain language must be used if the interface is for employees (French law requires software for employees in France to be in French). The platform should be flexible to accommodate such compliance (which basically ties back to being available in necessary languages and letting admin configure processes to meet local policies).

**Paper or Data export for legal**: maybe some places need a printable record signed by employee; the system should be able to produce localized templates for that if needed.

**Units and Metrics:** If any metrics are used (not heavy in performance mgmt, but maybe in goals someone might set units), just ensure no assumptions (like if template has something like "sales in \$" it might need local currency or measure like kg vs lbs in a goal measure).

**Right-to-Left (RTL) support:** If supporting languages like Arabic or Hebrew, the UI needs to handle right-to-left display properly.

**Language fallback & Admin translations:** Admin should be able to input translations for custom items (for example, if they add a custom competency called "Customer Obsession", they should be able to provide what that is in Spanish, French, etc., so that when a user uses the Spanish UI, they see the Spanish label).

### 11.2 Functional Requirements

- **Multi-Language UI:** The platform shall support a multilingual user interface. All standard UI text (menus, buttons, instructions, email templates) should be available in multiple languages. Users can select their preferred language or have it assigned by admin. Upon switching, all interface elements appear in that language (provided translation is available).
- **Languages Provided:** The system should offer translations for major languages (ideally at least 10-20 languages to cover global companies). The exact list should be defined (e.g., English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Arabic, Russian, etc.).
- **Custom Field Translation:** For any custom labels or content configured by admins (like names of review forms, custom field labels, rating scale labels, etc.), the system shall allow the admin to enter translations for each active language. If a translation is missing, it should default to a base language (like English) rather than showing blank or code.
- **Date/Time and Number Localization:** The system shall format dates, times, numbers, and currency according to the user’s locale settings. For example:

  - Dates: show in appropriate format (with month names in correct language if applicable).
  - Times: show in user’s local time zone with appropriate format (12h vs 24h as per locale).
  - Numbers: use correct decimal and thousand separators for locale.
  - Currency: when displaying amounts (like salary), show with locale’s currency symbol and formatting (and possibly in that currency if the system tracks currency per record).

- **Time Zone Handling:** Each user (or at least each region or office) should have a time zone set. Deadlines for tasks (like “complete review by 5 PM”) should consider time zone (the system might internally use UTC but show local time). Meeting scheduler for 1:1 should account time zones if participants differ. Also, notifications might need to be sent at a good local time (e.g., maybe schedule emails at 9 AM user’s time for a reminder, not at 3 AM).
- **Currency Handling:** The system shall allow configuration of currency at least at the level of each country or user. For compensation info, each employee likely has a currency (from HRIS data). The system should display monetary values in that currency with proper symbol (e.g., \$, €, ¥, £) and formatting. If managers view a team across currencies, the system might either show each in their own currency with a label, or possibly convert to one currency for consistency (if conversion rates are loaded). The simpler approach: show as "100,000 USD" vs "80,000 EUR", etc. Possibly allow running totals per currency but not mixing them.
- **Right-to-Left Layout:** If supporting RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew), the UI shall adjust direction: menus, text alignment, etc., should flip appropriately. Test to ensure the interface is usable in RTL mode.
- **Content Storage:** All text inputs (comments, goals, etc.) must be stored in Unicode (UTF-8) to support any language characters (accents, non-Latin scripts, etc.). Searching or sorting should handle these as well (e.g., case insensitive search in different scripts).
- **Locale-Specific Customization:** The platform shall allow certain configurations per locale if needed. Example: an admin might set that French employees have a slightly different review form or process (this might be more process than locale, but if needed the system could assign processes by location). Or if certain rating terms are legally sensitive in a country, they might use alternate wording for that locale. Ideally, not needed often, but should be flexible if the organization demands it.
- **Legal Compliance:** The system shall provide features to comply with country-specific legal requirements. For example:

  - If in a country employees must receive a copy of their review in the local language, the system's multilingual support covers that.
  - If in some countries performance data must be stored only in certain regions (data residency), that’s more deployment than feature, but might be relevant for SaaS (some vendors offer EU data centers, etc. – not a direct feature, but important for multinational compliance).
  - In EU, ensure that the system can allow anonymization or export of an individual's data if requested (GDPR rights).
  - If works council requires certain notifications, perhaps the system should be configurable to include them or allow certain access restrictions.

- **Holiday/Weekend Settings:** The admin should be able to configure the work week per region (like which days are weekends) so that automated scheduling (like default due dates maybe skip weekends, or send reminders on weekdays). Or at least avoid sending reminders on a Sunday for someone whose weekend is Friday-Saturday. Possibly integrate a holiday calendar per locale to avoid scheduling something like a review deadline on a major public holiday. This is a nice-to-have but shows consideration for localization.
- **Printed Documents Localization:** If employees print their performance review (some might want a signed physical copy), the printout should be in their chosen language and format and include necessary disclaimers if any for that locale.
- **Multi-Language Help/Support:** If the system has help tooltips or tutorial content, provide those in multiple languages too. (This might be beyond core requirement, but contributes to local usability).
- **Switch Language Easily:** Users should be able to change their language setting easily, possibly via a profile setting or a language dropdown. Once changed, it persists for that user in subsequent sessions.
- **No Hard-Coded Strings:** Ensure all user-visible text is translatable. Even error messages or validation prompts need to appear in the user’s language.
- **Local Character Input:** Ensure fields accept input like names with accents, or Chinese characters, etc. And search function can find them if typed exactly (maybe no need for transliteration search, but at least exact match in same script).

### 11.3 User Stories

- **As a French-speaking Employee in France,** I want the entire interface (menus, instructions, emails) of the performance system to be in French, so I can use it comfortably and because local law expects internal tools to be available in French for employees.
- **As an HR Admin,** I want to provide translations for our custom review questions (which we created in English) into Spanish, German, and Chinese, so that our employees in Latin America, Europe, and APAC see those questions in their native language during reviews.
- **As a Manager in Japan,** I want to see monetary values like salary or bonus in yen with the proper symbol (¥) and no decimal (since yen has no subunit), so that compensation info is meaningful to me.
- **As a Global HR Administrator,** I need to ensure that if an employee transfers from one country to another, their data (like performance history) remains accessible and their UI language can change accordingly. The system should allow updating their locale and all new communication should then be in the new language.
- **As a User,** I want dates to appear in the format I’m used to – for example, UK user expects "31/12/2025" not "12/31/2025". Similarly, US uses month/day. The system should respect these differences to avoid confusion on deadlines and meeting dates.
- **As an HRIT Specialist,** I must ensure that our performance data for EU employees is stored in compliance with GDPR. If our company requires data residency, I'd want the SaaS to possibly host EU data in EU. (If not direct feature, at least I'd clarify it’s possible or that data export for compliance is easy).
- **As an Arabic-speaking Employee,** I want to use the system in Arabic and see the layout oriented right-to-left, so it feels natural to read and input information in my language.
- **As a Regional HR in Saudi Arabia,** our weekends are Friday-Saturday. If I set a review due date as end of week, I want to be able to configure that the system considers Sunday a working day and Friday the off day for our region's schedule and perhaps sends reminders accordingly.
- **As a Performance Program Manager,** when I design the review process, I realize our German office has some different steps due to co-determination rules (like maybe they have an extra meeting to discuss results). I want to configure the process for that region slightly differently, without affecting other regions.
- **As an Employee,** I sometimes travel or relocate - if I temporarily work in another country, I might want to switch my UI language to English to work with colleagues, then back to my native language later. The system should allow me to change language anytime in settings.
- **As a Chinese HR Admin,** I notice some phrases in the Chinese interface aren’t exactly how we’d phrase it. I’d like the ability to adjust certain translations if needed (or at least report them). Possibly, if needed, I could override some default translations via a customization if something is off or we use a different internal term.
- **As a Global HR leader,** I want reassurance that no matter where our employees are – Asia, Europe, Americas – they all can equally access and use the tool in a way that feels local (language, time, format) and that any performance documentation extracted (like a PDF of review) can be provided in their local language if needed for compliance or personal record.

## 12. User Roles, Permissions, and Access Management

Security and proper access control are crucial. This section details the platform’s **user, role, and access management** capabilities, i.e., how different roles (employees, managers, HR, etc.) have controlled access to features and data, and how the system ensures data privacy and confidentiality through role-based access control (RBAC).

### 12.1 Description

**Default Roles:**
Typically, the system will have baseline roles such as:

- **Employee (Self):** Can set their own goals, complete their self-reviews, view their own performance history, give feedback to others (if allowed), etc. Cannot see other employees’ reviews (unless as a peer feedback provider but that would be limited).
- **Manager:** In addition to self capabilities, can set/approve goals for their direct reports, view their team members’ profiles and performance data, complete reviews for directs, view feedback given about their team (including anonymous 360 results in aggregated form), etc.
- **Higher-level Managers:** Should have access to performance data of indirect reports (depending on policy) or at least summary reports. Usually, anyone in the management chain above should have some level of view (like a department head might see all reviews in their dept).
- **HR Business Partner/HR Manager:** Typically can view and manage performance data for all employees in their span (maybe their region or division). HR often has access to all reviews, can initiate processes, run reports, etc. They might also be able to edit or override in case of issues (like reopen a review).
- **System Administrator:** Full access to configuration (create forms, manage users, etc.), perhaps also full data access by nature of admin (or an ability to impersonate others if needed for support).
- **Matrix Manager or Secondary Reviewer:** Some organizations have dotted-line managers or project leaders who should have some input. The system might allow granting a specific user access to someone’s performance info (like a project leader can do a review on an employee not directly under them). Could be an explicit share or an assignment of a "matrix manager" role for that employee.
- **Mentors/Coaches:** If formal mentors exist in system, maybe they have access to view mentee’s goals or development plan but not the full review? This could be a custom role possible to configure.
- **Executive Viewer:** Possibly a role for executives or board members to review performance summaries, with read-only access across many data without being able to edit.

**Permissions:**
We define what each role can do:

- **View**: e.g., an employee can view their own goal and review, a manager can view their team's, HR can view everyone’s (or certain groups).
- **Edit/Create**: e.g., employees create their goals, managers can edit their employees’ goals or add comments, HR might edit forms or input corrections.
- **Approve**: certain roles can approve goals or reviews.
- **Administrative**: only certain roles can manage system configuration or manage user accounts.

**Data Partitioning:**
Within roles like HR, there might be region or department scoping. E.g., an HR partner for Sales division should see only that division’s data. The system should allow assignment of user to e.g., "HR role + Sales division scope." This might be achieved by tying HR users to particular organizational units.

**Confidentiality:**

- 360 anonymous feedback: ensure that a normal manager/employee cannot see who gave what feedback if supposed to be anonymous. Only perhaps an admin could see raw data if needed, but typically not even them unless for audit.
- Private notes (manager's journal) only visible to that manager (and maybe to HR or not depending on design).
- Employee vs manager view: e.g., an employee might not see manager's section in the review until finalized, or might not see calibration notes.
- If any calibration or ranking info is stored, normal employees shouldn’t see that.

**Delegation and Proxy:** Possibly allow a manager to delegate access to an assistant or something. For example, an admin assistant might help input review schedules or send reminders. The system should allow creating a proxy user or delegate access under controlled conditions (commonly, one user can act on behalf of another in some systems).

**Role Customization:**
Allow organization to add roles or adjust permissions. Already mentioned in customization, but specifically, maybe a company wants a "View Only HR" who can see data but not edit, or a "Compensation Analyst" who only accesses comp planning module. The system’s permission model should accommodate new roles or granular permission toggles.

**Access Logging:**
For security, the system should log user access especially for sensitive data (like HR viewing a review, etc. if needed for compliance). Not necessarily visible to users, but in back-end logs.

**User Management:**
Admins should be able to add/deactivate users (if not fully automated via HRIS integration), assign roles (maybe by group membership or manually). Possibly bulk assign or role by attribute (like if job title contains "HR", auto assign HR role, though manual control is fine).

**Impersonation for Support:**
Admins might impersonate a user to see what they see when troubleshooting an issue (only if logged and extremely limited to admins for support purposes).

### 12.2 Functional Requirements

- **Role Definitions:** The system shall provide a Role-Based Access Control system with predefined roles (Employee, Manager, HR, Admin, etc.) and the ability to create custom roles. Each role has associated permissions that control access to functions and data.
- **Permission Granularity:** The system shall allow permissions at a granular level such as:

  - View/edit own data vs team data vs all data.
  - Manage goals (self vs reports).
  - Manage performance reviews (self vs reports vs organization).
  - Access to succession or comp modules (some roles maybe only for HR).
  - Administration of system settings.
    This may be presented as a matrix where each role has allow/deny for various actions.

- **Manager Hierarchy Access:** By default, a direct manager role shall have access to their direct reports' performance data (reviews, goals, feedback). The system should automatically assign that access based on the org hierarchy imported (from HRIS). A manager should also be able to view indirect reports optionally (maybe view-only for skip-level data or aggregated view) if the company wants that. Possibly make that an option (some orgs allow skip-level review visibility, others may not).
- **HR Role Scoping:** The system shall enable HR or other power users to be scoped by org unit or location. E.g., create an HR role instance that is limited to Europe region employees. The admin can assign which population a given HR user can see. That HR user then can view/edit data for those employees only.
- **Employee Self-Service:** As an Employee (non-manager), the system shall only permit viewing of one’s own information (goals, reviews, feedback received/given) and not anyone else’s (besides maybe a directory info of colleagues if provided, but not their performance data). They can create and edit their own goals (until finalized or unless manager locks them), input self-reviews, and initiate feedback to others. They should not see managerial or HR-only sections of forms (e.g., if the manager writes a private note or there’s a hidden calibration field, that stays hidden).
- **Peer Feedback Access:** If an employee is asked to give peer feedback on someone, the system shall allow them to input it, but after submission, they should typically not see all other peer feedback or the final review (unless company chooses to share results later in summary). At least anonymity must be preserved.
- **Manager Access:** Managers shall be able to create/edit goals for their direct reports (or approve their goals), see their past reviews, input new reviews, and see feedback about their reports (including peer feedback results if part of 360). Managers should not see data for employees not under them (except perhaps aggregated data in reports if authorized). If a manager changes, the new manager gains that access (and maybe the old one loses access after a transition period).
- **Higher Manager/Executives:** People above the direct manager in hierarchy (like a department head) might have read access to reviews of all below for oversight. The system should allow such hierarchical access. Possibly implemented by treating those up the chain as having a 'manager-like' role over extended team. Admin can decide if for example a VP can see all reviews in their org or not.
- **HR Access:** HR users should have broad access depending on assignment. Usually HR can view all performance data in their area, initiate or reopen reviews, adjust things if needed (like fix a goal name, or submit on behalf of someone who missed, etc.), and run reports across the organization. They might also manage calibration sessions or have ability to override ratings (with proper logging). Some HR might also act as admins for configuration (or that could be separate "System Admin" role).
- **System Administrator:** This role shall have full configuration rights: manage roles, manage forms, system settings, etc. They may or may not have access to individual performance content by default; typically they could if needed because they can assign themselves, but some companies may want separation (like IT admin can configure but not snoop on reviews). Ideally, allow a separation: e.g., a "Config Admin" can do settings but not open reviews, whereas "HR Superuser" can see all data. Or have one super-role that can do both. But it's good to differentiate if possible.
- **Impersonation/Proxy:** The platform shall allow an admin to impersonate a user for support reasons. This action should be logged (e.g., "Admin X viewed User Y's account via impersonation at time..."). Also possibly allow managers to delegate tasks. For example, a manager going on leave might delegate their review approval to their manager or HR. The system could allow a temporary assignment: user A can act as user B for specific functions.
- **Data Visibility Toggles:** The system shall have internal checks to enforce that certain data is only visible to roles intended. For example:

  - Anonymous 360 responses: ensure only aggregated results are shown to the subject and their manager, not individual identified responses. Possibly only HR could pull raw data in an export if absolutely needed.
  - Private notes: only the author (manager or HR) sees their notes. If HR should also see manager's notes, that might be a setting, but likely manager notes are private even from HR, unless needed in an investigation.
  - Succession plans likely accessible only to HR and top execs, not to general managers (depending on company policy).
  - Compensation info: perhaps only managers and up (not employees themselves see others' comp).

- **Edit vs View rights:** E.g., after a review is submitted and finalized, an employee might have view-only access to it (no editing). A manager might have edit rights until finalization then view. HR might always have an edit ability (to correct errors) but should be cautious in use. The system should enforce states: if locked, only HR or admin can unlock.
- **Audit Logging:** The system shall keep a log of key actions (especially edits or view of sensitive data). Possibly not all views, but maybe all changes. But for compliance, maybe track if HR changed a rating after submission or if someone accessed a record after the fact. This log might not be user-facing but stored for security audit.
- **User Management:** There should be an interface for admins to search and pull up user accounts, see their roles, reset their password (if not SSO), deactivate (like upon leaving), etc. Possibly bulk update roles (if a large reorg happens, etc.).
- **Security of Data Export:** Only certain roles (like HR or Admin) should be allowed to export large datasets (like all reviews). That could be a permission so employees can’t just dump data via some find or trick.
- **Testing roles:** Perhaps an admin can create a test user to see how an employee sees the system, without real data (aside from impersonation). This likely handled by impersonation or a separate test environment.
- **Approval Roles:** If the workflow includes approvals (like second-level manager approves review), ensure that person gets the right level of access to do so (they can see the review content and then approve). That means the second-level manager has at least read (maybe comment) access to their subordinate's subordinate's review in that context.
- **Notification control:** Only relevant people get notifications. E.g., when an employee submits a review, their manager gets notified, not others. HR might get summary notifications (like "all reviews completed in X unit"). The role definitions help target that.

### 12.3 User Stories

- **As an Employee,** I should only be able to see my own performance information and not accidentally access anyone else's data. For example, I can view my review and goals, but I cannot see the goals or reviews of my coworker.
- **As a Manager,** I want to easily view and manage the performance records of my direct reports, but I should not see information of employees who are not under me. For instance, I can pull up the review for each of my team members, but I cannot open reviews of people in a different team that I don't manage.
- **As a Manager,** when I move to a new role or team, the system should update my access: I should gain access to my new reports' data and lose access to my old reports. This should happen promptly when the org change is effective (integrating with HRIS).
- **As a Senior Manager (Director),** I want to see the performance summaries of all employees two levels below me as well, so I can ensure consistency. I don't need to edit them, but view rights would help in calibration discussions. (Alternatively, maybe I only see aggregated data unless I take over direct reports).
- **As an HR Business Partner for the Engineering division,** I need to be able to see and possibly edit performance documents for all employees in Engineering, but I should not access data for Sales or Marketing divisions which I don't support. My user account should be scoped to Engineering only.
- **As an HR Admin,** I want to impersonate a manager who reported an issue with their view, so I can see exactly what they see and troubleshoot the problem. Once done, I'll exit impersonation. This action should be secure and logged, so it's not abused.
- **As an HR Manager,** I might sometimes need to reopen a completed review for editing (maybe a mistake was found). I should have permission to do that, while normal managers cannot once it's locked. The system will note that I did so, for transparency.
- **As an Employee,** I want assurance that feedback I provide in a 360 for a peer remains anonymous. I should not find any way for the peer or their manager to trace that it specifically came from me. Only the aggregated or anonymized output should be visible to them.
- **As a System Administrator,** I need to add a temporary contractor as a user who can only view reports (analytics) but not any detailed personal data. I should be able to create a custom role "Reporting Analyst" with only access to the analytics dashboards, but no ability to drill down into individual reviews.
- **As an IT Security Auditor,** I want to review logs of who accessed or changed sensitive performance records. For example, if a rating was altered after completion, I want to see which admin did it and when. Or if an HR person viewed a high-level exec's review, I want to ensure they had reason/permission.
- **As an Employee on a special project team,** I have a dotted-line manager (project lead) in addition to my functional manager. I want that project lead to be able to enter feedback about me in the system (maybe via the 360 or as a co-reviewer), but not necessarily see all of my other performance info. The system should allow granting that project lead the specific access needed (like they can fill a section of my review or see my goal progress related to the project, but not everything).
- **As a Performance Program Owner,** I want to set it such that once a review is submitted and signed by employee and manager, neither can change it (ensuring integrity), but HR can still correct typos or errors if needed with a special action.
- **As an Administrator,** I need to be able to deactivate user accounts when employees leave the company so they no longer can log in or receive notifications, and ensure their former managers or HR can still access their past records if needed for archive.
- **As a Mentor,** if I have been formally assigned to an employee as a mentor, I might have a special view of their development plan, but I should not see their full review unless granted. The system should support such selective sharing (maybe the employee can choose to share their goals or plan with their mentor).
- **As a Compliance Officer,** I need to ensure that performance reviews for, say, European employees are not accessible by just any US manager due to stricter privacy; maybe we design roles so that only those with a legitimate need (like their chain of command or HR for Europe) can see them. The system should be configurable to respect those regional privacy needs as well if required.
- **As an HR Admin,** I want to test the permissions configuration by logging in as a dummy manager to see that they cannot see outside their team, etc. (Potentially done via impersonation or test accounts).
- **As an Executive,** I might have a personal assistant who helps schedule my reviews with my team. If possible, I'd like to delegate just the scheduling or admin part to them without giving them rights to see the actual content of my team’s reviews. The system might allow calendar sharing but not data sharing.

_The above sections provide a comprehensive breakdown of requirements for each feature area of the SaaS Performance Management platform. In the following section, we will consolidate these into structured outputs like summary tables and visual aids to enhance clarity._
