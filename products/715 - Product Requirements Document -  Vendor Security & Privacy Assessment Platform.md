Great. I’ll draft a comprehensive 200-page product requirements document for a SaaS Vendor Security and Privacy Assessment platform targeted at product managers.

This document will define features to enable vendors to manage compliance profiles, allow companies to assess vendors, support workflow and notifications, and integrate standard compliance frameworks. I’ll organize the content with structured sections including overview, personas, user flows, technical architecture, integrations, compliance frameworks, workflow systems, notifications, access controls, and documentation templates.

I’ll get started and let you know when it’s ready for your review.

# Product Requirements Document: Vendor Security & Privacy Assessment Platform

## Executive Summary

Modern enterprises rely on a vast network of third-party software vendors and service providers, which dramatically expands their risk surface. On average, companies share confidential data with over **583 third-party vendors** ([99+ Essential Third-Party Risk Statistics and Trends for 2024](https://secureframe.com/blog/third-party-risk-statistics#:~:text=The%20average%20company%20is%20sharing,party%20vendors)), and nearly two-thirds have experienced a security incident via a vendor in the past year ([99+ Essential Third-Party Risk Statistics and Trends for 2024](https://secureframe.com/blog/third-party-risk-statistics#:~:text=%2A%2098,%28Prevalent)). As cybersecurity threats grow and privacy regulations tighten, organizations face mounting pressure to ensure that their vendors meet stringent security and data protection standards. Yet today’s vendor security assessments are often **manual, time‑consuming, and fragmented** – driven by endless questionnaires, scattered documents, and prolonged back‑and‑forth communications.

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) proposes a **SaaS Vendor Security and Privacy Assessment Platform** designed to streamline and centralize the third-party risk assessment process for both vendors and their clients. The platform will enable vendors to **create and maintain a comprehensive security & compliance profile**, including standardized questionnaires, certifications, policies, and audit reports. In turn, customers (prospective or current client companies) can **discover and evaluate vendor profiles in a centralized catalog**, request additional information or attestations through a guided workflow, and monitor vendors’ compliance over time – all in one system. The solution aims to replace ad-hoc emails and spreadsheets with an automated, collaborative platform, significantly reducing the effort and cycle time needed to conduct due diligence (case studies have shown up to a _96% reduction_ in review time using such approaches ([Whistic: the Complete Vendor Security Platform | Whistic Case Study](https://www.whistic.com/resources/case-studies/whistic-the-complete-vendor-security-platform#:~:text=96))).

**Key capabilities** of the platform include:

- **Vendor Trust Profiles:** A secure, vendor-managed profile showcasing each vendor’s cybersecurity posture and privacy compliance. Vendors can populate standardized assessment questionnaires (e.g. CAIQ, SIG), upload certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.), policies, and supporting documents, and continually update their information.
- **Central Assessment Catalog:** A searchable catalog of vendor profiles accessible to customer risk teams. Customers can easily find vendors (or invite new vendors to onboard) and review their security & privacy information at a glance, without repeated data entry.
- **Workflow for Assessments & Requests:** Integrated workflow tools for customers to request additional evidence (like tailored questionnaires, audit reports, or certification documents) from vendors. The platform tracks request status, deadlines, and completions, providing a clear audit trail of all communications.
- **Profile Sharing & Trust Center Integration:** Features that let vendors proactively share their profile with clients and prospects. This includes the ability to generate shareable links or embed a _Trust Center_ widget on their website, so customer-facing teams (sales, customer success) can easily grant access to the vendor’s security profile as part of the sales process.
- **Automated Notifications & Reminders:** A notification engine to automate alerts for upcoming vendor reassessments, expiring certifications, new document requests, and profile access requests. Both vendors and customers receive timely reminders (e.g. “Vendor X’s ISO 27001 certificate expires in 30 days”) to ensure nothing falls through the cracks.
- **Standardized Questionnaire Library:** Out-of-the-box support for industry-standard security and privacy questionnaires and compliance templates – including **CAIQ, SIG, NIST CSF, VSA, GDPR, ISO 27001, Privacy Shield**, etc. – enabling vendors to answer these once and reuse them across many clients ([Thoropass recognized as a leader in the G2 Winter 2025 Grid Reports including Audit Management, Cloud Compliance, and more - Thoropass](https://thoropass.com/blog/announcements/g2-winter-grid-reports/#:~:text=,ISO%2027001%2C%20Privacy%20Shield%2C%20etc)). The system will also support custom questionnaires and mapping answers to multiple frameworks to reduce duplication of effort.

This PRD is structured to guide product managers in understanding the target users, use cases, and detailed functional requirements for this B2B SaaS platform. It covers user personas, end-to-end user journeys, core feature requirements (grouped by functional domain), as well as considerations for UI/UX design, technical architecture, data models, workflow automation, security standards, integrations, and success metrics. The goal is to provide a **comprehensive blueprint** for building a vendor security & privacy assessment platform that **fosters trust and transparency** between businesses and their third-party vendors, while dramatically improving efficiency and compliance assurance in the vendor review process.

## User Personas

To design an effective solution, it’s important to understand the key user personas who will interact with the Vendor Security & Privacy Assessment Platform. Below are the primary personas and their motivations:

### Vendor Compliance Manager (Security Officer at the Vendor Company)

**Profile:** This user is responsible for the vendor organization’s security compliance and responding to customer security inquiries. Typically an IT security manager, compliance officer, or CISO delegate, they possess deep knowledge of the vendor’s security controls, policies, and certifications.

**Goals & Needs:**

- **Centralize Security Information:** Maintain an up-to-date profile of the company’s security posture (policies, certifications, audit results, etc.) in one place.
- **Efficient Questionnaire Response:** Avoid answering repetitive security questionnaires from each customer. Instead, publish standardized answers (e.g. CAIQ, SIG) that can be reused for many clients.
- **Control & Accuracy:** Ensure all information shared with customers is accurate, approved, and consistent with the latest audits and compliance status. Manage document versions and control who can see sensitive documents.
- **Demonstrate Trustworthiness:** Proactively showcase the vendor’s compliance (e.g. SOC 2 report, ISO 27001 certificate, GDPR measures) to satisfy prospective customers and speed up sales cycles.
- **Minimize Workload:** Reduce the time spent on manual paperwork by automating reminders for upcoming renewals (certifications, pen-test schedules) and by delegating parts of questionnaires to subject matter experts internally when needed.

### Vendor Sales/Account Representative (Customer-Facing Vendor Team Member)

**Profile:** A sales executive, account manager, or solutions engineer at the vendor company who interacts with customers and prospects. They often field security-related questions during the sales process and coordinate with the compliance team to provide answers.

**Goals & Needs:**

- **Quickly Address Customer Security Inquiries:** Provide prospects with immediate access to the vendor’s security & privacy information without lengthy back-and-forth. For example, share a link to the vendor’s profile or trust portal rather than emailing large files.
- **Accelerate the Sales Cycle:** Use the platform as a _sales enablement_ tool to remove security review bottlenecks. A readily available security profile can help satisfy a prospect’s due diligence early, potentially leading to faster deal closures.
- **Easy Sharing & Tracking:** Be able to send a security profile to a customer (via a secure link or email invite) and know when the customer has viewed it. Possibly get notified if a prospect requests additional info, so they can follow up promptly.
- **Limitless Access, With Control:** Share information confidently, knowing that sensitive documents are protected (e.g. behind NDA click-through or watermarked) and that access can be revoked if needed. They need the ability to present just the right level of detail – perhaps a high-level public profile for marketing, and a deeper profile for serious prospects under NDA.
- **Collaborate with Compliance:** If a customer has a custom questionnaire or follow-up questions, the sales rep needs to easily loop in the Vendor Compliance Manager (or delegate questions in the platform) to provide responses, all while maintaining visibility on the request’s status.

### Customer Vendor Risk Assessor (Third-Party Risk Analyst at Client Company)

**Profile:** This persona works in the customer’s risk management, cybersecurity, or compliance department. Common titles include Third-Party Risk Analyst, Security Analyst, or Vendor Risk Manager. They are tasked with evaluating the security and privacy risks of vendors before and during the business relationship.

**Goals & Needs:**

- **Efficient Vendor Evaluation:** Quickly determine if a vendor meets the company’s security requirements by reviewing their profile (policies, controls, attestations) without having to send out lengthy questionnaires for every vendor if not needed.
- **Streamlined Assessments:** Initiate structured assessments for new vendors or recurring reviews for existing vendors. This includes sending out additional questionnaires (if the vendor profile is insufficient or a specialized questionnaire is needed) and collecting evidence/documents in one workflow.
- **Standardized Data for Comparison:** Use standard questionnaires (like SIG or CAIQ responses) to compare multiple vendors on equal footing. The assessor wants to see responses to the same set of baseline questions for all cloud vendors, for example.
- **Risk Identification:** Identify gaps or high-risk areas in a vendor’s responses. For instance, flag if a vendor has no incident response plan or if their certifications are out-of-date. The platform should highlight such issues, aiding the analyst in risk scoring.
- **Audit Trail & Reporting:** Maintain a record of all vendor assessments performed, communications (requests, responses), and decisions (approved/conditionally approved/rejected). They need to produce reports for management or auditors showing due diligence was done for each vendor.
- **Collaboration:** The analyst might need input from internal stakeholders (IT, legal, privacy) on certain vendor answers. They need the ability to share the vendor’s submitted information internally or get approvals (e.g. get the CISO to sign off on a high-risk vendor exception).

### Customer Procurement or Compliance Manager (Business Stakeholder)

**Profile:** A user in the client organization who is involved in onboarding the vendor. This could be a procurement manager ensuring vendors meet compliance requirements before contract signing, or a privacy/data protection officer verifying GDPR compliance, or a business unit manager who initiated the vendor purchase and must ensure due diligence is completed.

**Goals & Needs:**

- **Vendor Onboarding Governance:** Verify that the security assessment of a new vendor is completed before the vendor is fully onboarded or integrated. They rely on the risk assessor’s input, but they need visibility into the status (e.g. “Vendor X is pending security approval”).
- **Checklist Compliance:** Ensure all required documents and checks (security questionnaire, data processing agreement, privacy impact assessment, etc.) have been collected from the vendor. The platform should provide a checklist or status view for each vendor.
- **Integrate with Procurement Workflows:** Ideally, the tool integrates or aligns with procurement systems or CRM – so that when a new vendor is being evaluated, they can easily trigger an assessment request in the platform and later see the outcome (approved, rejected, risk mitigations required).
- **Occasional Access:** This persona may not use the system daily like the risk analyst, but they need to be able to log in to review summary risk reports or download compliance documents (like the vendor’s ISO certificate or signed agreements) when needed for audits.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Particularly for privacy officers or compliance managers, ensure that vendors handling personal data have provided satisfactory answers related to GDPR or other regulations. They might use specialized questionnaires (DPIAs, privacy assessments) which the platform should support or store in the vendor’s profile.

_(Note: There is also an implied **Platform Administrator** persona (e.g., an IT admin at either a vendor or customer organization responsible for managing user accounts, permissions, and configurations for their organization’s use of the platform). This persona’s needs around user management, SSO integration, etc., are addressed in the Security & Compliance and Integration sections.)_

## Use Cases and User Journeys

This section illustrates key use cases and typical user journeys through the platform, demonstrating how the personas interact with the system to achieve their goals.

### Use Case 1: Vendor Onboarding and Profile Creation

**Objective:** A vendor company sets up their security & privacy profile on the platform so it can be shared with customers.

**Scenario:** Acme Corp (a software vendor) has decided to join the platform to streamline customer security assessments. The Vendor Compliance Manager at Acme needs to create and populate Acme’s security profile.

**Steps:**

1. **Account Setup:** The Vendor Compliance Manager registers Acme Corp on the platform. They provide basic company details and create user accounts for relevant team members (e.g., an account for themselves and perhaps one for a Sales Engineer).
2. **Company Profile Initialization:** Upon first login, the platform guides the manager to set up Acme’s “Trust Profile.” A wizard or checklist may be presented (e.g., “Complete your company profile – 0% done”). The manager fills in sections like _Company Overview_, _Security Contacts_, and _Compliance Certifications Owned_.
3. **Upload Documentation:** The manager uploads key security documents: e.g., Acme’s latest SOC 2 report, ISO 27001 certificate, GDPR privacy policy, penetration test summary, etc. Each document is categorized (Audit Report, Certification, Policy, etc.), and metadata like expiration dates or applicable scope can be added.
4. **Answer Standard Questionnaires:** Using the built-in questionnaire library, the manager answers a standard questionnaire (say the CAIQ) within the platform. The system provides an online form segmented by domains (e.g., compliance, data security, etc.) where the manager can input answers or select from predefined options (Yes/No/Not Applicable, with commentary as needed). They might also fill out a SIG or other relevant templates. The platform may allow importing answers from a spreadsheet if they already have them.
5. **Set Profile Sharing Preferences:** The manager reviews what parts of the profile will be public or require permission. For example, they might mark certain documents as “available upon request” (so that an NDA or explicit approval is needed for access). They can also generate a public-facing “Trust Center” page that shows non-sensitive information (e.g., high-level compliance posture) to anyone with the link.
6. **Finalize & Publish:** Once all required sections are filled (the profile completeness indicator shows 100%), the manager publishes the profile. Acme Corp is now listed in the platform’s vendor catalog (possibly with a “verified” badge since they completed a standard assessment). They can now share this profile with prospective customers or have clients discover it.

### Use Case 2: Customer Initiates a New Vendor Assessment

**Objective:** A client company’s risk team evaluates a new vendor through the platform, requesting any additional info needed and reaching an approval decision.

**Scenario:** BetaBank is considering using Acme Corp’s software. BetaBank’s Third-Party Risk Analyst will perform a security assessment of Acme via the platform.

**Steps:**

1. **Vendor Search or Invite:** The Risk Analyst at BetaBank logs into the platform and searches the vendor catalog for “Acme Corp.” If Acme’s profile is already on the platform (as in this case), it appears, showing a summary (e.g., “Profile completeness: 100%, SOC 2 available, CAIQ completed”). If Acme was not already present, the analyst could send an invite for Acme to join the platform (which would trigger an email to Acme’s team to register and fill out a profile).
2. **Review Vendor Profile:** The analyst opens Acme Corp’s profile. They can browse sections like _Security Certifications_ (seeing SOC 2 and ISO certificates), _Policies_ (perhaps summaries of key policies or uploaded docs), and _Questionnaire Responses_ (viewing Acme’s answers to the CAIQ and any other provided standard questionnaire). They note that Acme has a SOC 2 Type II from last quarter and a completed CAIQ.
3. **Additional Document Request:** BetaBank has an internal policy to collect a signed Data Processing Agreement (DPA) and a recent vulnerability scan report from all new vendors. The analyst uses the platform’s request feature to ask Acme Corp for these documents. In the platform, they click “Request New Document” and select from templates (e.g., a DPA template or a free-form request “Please upload your latest vulnerability scan results”). They set a due date of 2 weeks for Acme to respond.
4. **Custom Questionnaire (if needed):** Suppose BetaBank also requires vendors to answer a few custom questions not covered by CAIQ. The analyst can create or select a small custom questionnaire (for instance, a few yes/no questions about BetaBank-specific policies) and send it through the platform to Acme. The request is now visible in Acme’s profile page as “Pending Requests: 2” (one for the DPA, one for the custom questions).
5. **Vendor Notification & Response:** The Vendor Compliance Manager at Acme (and/or the Sales Rep) gets an automatic notification (email and in-app) that BetaBank has requested additional info. They log in to the platform, see BetaBank’s pending requests, and upload the requested DPA document and answer the custom questionnaire. The platform might allow them to reuse previously stored answers for similar questions or at least save responses as they go. They submit the responses.
6. **Assessment Completion:** The Risk Analyst at BetaBank receives a notification that Acme has responded. They log in and review the newly provided DPA (ensuring it’s signed and satisfactory) and check the answers to the custom questionnaire. If something is missing or unclear, the analyst can comment or ask follow-up questions through a discussion thread attached to the request.
7. **Risk Analysis & Decision:** After reviewing all information, the analyst uses the platform’s risk scoring feature to rate Acme Corp (perhaps the platform auto-suggests a risk level based on the presence of certain answers or lack of certain controls). The analyst records an overall assessment outcome (e.g., “Acme Corp approved for use, risk rating Low”). They mark the assessment as completed on the platform on a specific date.
8. **Stakeholder Notification:** The platform can now notify relevant stakeholders at BetaBank (e.g., the procurement manager) that Acme Corp’s security review is completed and the vendor is approved. The vendor’s profile might be marked in the system as “Approved” for BetaBank with an expiry/renewal date after one year.
9. **Record Keeping:** All artifacts (Acme’s profile, the DPA, question responses, risk notes) are stored in the platform. If auditors or management need to review BetaBank’s due diligence on Acme, the analyst can export or show a report from the platform with all these details.

### Use Case 3: Vendor Shares Profile with a Prospect (Sales Enablement)

**Objective:** A vendor proactively shares its security profile with a prospective customer to preempt and answer security questions as part of a sales cycle.

**Scenario:** Acme Corp’s Sales team is in talks with GammaTech, a potential customer. GammaTech’s procurement process includes a security review. Instead of waiting for GammaTech to send a questionnaire, the Acme Sales Representative uses the platform to give GammaTech access to Acme’s profile.

**Steps:**

1. **Generating a Share Invite:** From Acme’s perspective, the Sales Rep or Compliance Manager goes to the platform’s sharing section for Acme’s profile. They choose “Share Profile” and enter the email of GammaTech’s point of contact (or generate a share link). They choose to require an NDA acceptance before GammaTech can view certain sensitive documents (like the full SOC 2 report).
2. **Prospect Receives Invite:** The GammaTech analyst receives an email saying “Acme Corp has shared their security profile with you via [Platform Name]. Click here to access.” The analyst clicks the secure link.
3. **One-Time Registration/NDA:** Because GammaTech’s user is new to the platform, they are prompted to create a free account (or authenticate) to view the profile. Before viewing, the platform presents an NDA or terms of access that GammaTech must agree to (if Acme required it). The GammaTech user accepts the NDA, which is logged by the system.
4. **Viewing the Profile:** The GammaTech user can now browse Acme’s profile just like any customer user. They see all the sections and documents that Acme has made available. For example, they might download a whitepaper on Acme’s security architecture and view the CAIQ responses directly in the web interface.
5. **Follow-up Request:** After reviewing, GammaTech finds almost everything they need, but they have two extra questions about Acme’s incident response process. Using the platform’s interface (since GammaTech now effectively can interact with Acme’s profile), the GammaTech analyst uses a “Request Info” or Q&A feature to ask those two questions. (Alternatively, if GammaTech has its own small questionnaire, they could send it through the platform.)
6. **Real-time Collaboration:** Acme’s Compliance Manager gets notified of the questions and responds within the platform (or attaches an additional document describing the incident response plan). GammaTech gets notified of the answer. This Q&A dialogue is contained within the platform, providing clarity and speed.
7. **Outcome:** GammaTech is satisfied with the information from Acme’s profile and proceeds without needing a formal separate assessment process. Acme’s proactive sharing shortened the evaluation phase. The platform logs that GammaTech accessed the profile and what documents were viewed, so Acme’s team has a record of engagement and can follow up with GammaTech’s sales opportunity accordingly.

### Use Case 4: Continuous Monitoring and Re-assessment Workflow

**Objective:** Both vendor and customer keep the vendor’s profile up-to-date over time, with automated reminders for periodic re-assessments and expiring items.

**Scenario:** Acme Corp was approved by BetaBank a year ago. It’s time for BetaBank’s annual review of Acme, and Acme also has a few documents nearing expiration.

**Steps:**

1. **Automated Reminder to Customer:** 30 days before the one-year mark of Acme’s last assessment, the platform triggers a reminder to BetaBank’s Risk Analyst: “It’s time to re-assess Acme Corp.” The analyst is prompted to schedule an annual review. Similarly, an alert shows up on their dashboard for upcoming reviews.
2. **Automated Reminder to Vendor:** The platform also notifies Acme’s Vendor Compliance Manager: “Your ISO 27001 certificate on file will expire next month. Please update it to keep your profile current for your customers.” It might also list any questionnaire answers that are over a year old and suggest reviewing them.
3. **Vendor Updates Profile:** The Acme manager obtains their renewed ISO 27001 cert, logs into the platform, and replaces the expired certificate file with the new one (updating the metadata to show it’s valid for another year). They also update any parts of the questionnaire that have changed in the past year (perhaps Acme implemented new encryption standards, so they update the relevant answer).
4. **Customer Review:** BetaBank’s analyst sees that Acme’s profile has been updated (the platform can highlight changes since last year). The analyst could decide that no further action is needed if everything looks good (especially if the platform’s risk score for Acme remains low and key docs are updated). They mark the re-assessment as complete with a note “Profile updated, no issues found.”
5. **Escalation if Overdue:** If Acme had not updated the expiring cert by the due date, the platform would escalate notifications – e.g., send additional reminders, and notify BetaBank that “Acme’s ISO cert is expired – re-assessment required.” BetaBank might then reach out through the platform to prompt Acme or even temporarily flag the vendor as “conditional” in their records.
6. **Continuous Monitoring (Optional Extension):** If integrated with external risk feeds (like security ratings services), the platform could also inform BetaBank of any notable changes in Acme’s security posture (e.g., “Acme’s security rating dropped in the last month” or “News of a breach at a fourth-party provider Acme uses”). That could trigger an unscheduled review. In response, BetaBank might send Acme a questionnaire about that topic via the platform (e.g., an incident impact questionnaire).
7. **Ongoing Cycle:** This use case underscores how the platform facilitates ongoing vendor management – not a one-time checklist. Both sides use it to keep information current and ensure that trust is maintained throughout the vendor relationship.

These user journeys demonstrate the end-to-end interactions supported by the platform – from initial onboarding to day-to-day sharing and periodic reviews. In each case, the platform serves as the single system of engagement and record, improving efficiency, clarity, and accountability in the vendor security assessment process.

## Feature Requirements (by Functional Domain)

The platform’s functionality can be grouped into several core domains. For each domain, the key feature requirements are detailed below. These requirements represent what the system **must do** to meet user needs identified in the personas and use cases.

### 1. Vendor Trust Profile Management

This domain covers all features related to vendors creating and maintaining their company’s security/privacy profile.

- **Company & Profile Information:** The system shall provide a structured vendor profile with predefined sections (Company Overview, Data Protection Practices, Compliance Certifications, etc.). Vendors can input textual information (e.g., company description, security program overview) and list key details (e.g., headquarters location, number of employees, cloud infrastructure used, etc.).
- **Security and Privacy Fields:** The profile includes specific fields capturing security program details – for example, “Has SOC 2 (Yes/No + date)”, “ISO 27001 Certified (Yes/No + certificate)”, “PCI DSS Compliance (level, date)”, “Privacy Frameworks Adopted (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)”. These fields ensure a standardized summary of the vendor’s posture. Vendors should be able to update these fields as their status changes.
- **Document Uploads:** Vendors can upload supporting documents to their profile (with drag-and-drop or select file). Each document is classified under a type: _Certifications_ (e.g., ISO certificate, PCI AoC), _Audit Reports_ (SOC 2, penetration test results), _Policies/Procedures_ (privacy policy, incident response plan), _Compliance Artifacts_ (data flow diagrams, etc.), _Contracts/Agreements_ (perhaps sample DPAs or security addendums). Metadata such as issue date, expiry date, and a short description can be attached to each document.
- **Compliance Badges & Status:** Based on the data provided, the platform displays visual badges or indicators on the vendor’s profile (for example, icons for SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, etc.). If a certification is verified (e.g., an admin has reviewed the document or via integration with a registry), it could show a “verified” badge. Additionally, a high-level “Trust Score” or profile completeness percentage may be calculated to incentivize vendors to fully populate their profile.
- **Version Control:** The profile should maintain versioning for key sections. If a vendor updates a major document or questionnaire response, the previous version should be retrievable, and the change history logged. This is important for audit trail and also for customers to see what changed over time.
- **Privacy & Confidentiality Settings:** Vendors must be able to mark certain profile elements as _public_ vs _restricted_. For instance, a vendor might make a summary of their SOC 2 report publicly visible, but the full report PDF only accessible on request. Each document or even specific answers can have an access level (public, require NDA, or internal-only). These settings tie into the sharing/access control features (described later).
- **Multiple Profiles (if applicable):** (Optional) If a vendor has multiple products or subsidiaries, the platform might allow them to maintain separate profiles under one account (e.g., a parent company and a child company profile). Each profile would be distinct but manageable by the vendor’s users. This is a nice-to-have for complex organizations.

### 2. Questionnaire Management & Standard Templates

This domain entails the ability to manage questionnaires – both standardized ones and custom ones – and for vendors to respond to them efficiently.

- **Library of Standard Questionnaires:** The platform shall include a library of pre-built, industry-standard questionnaires: **CAIQ (Cloud Security Alliance), SIG Core/Lite (Shared Assessments), NIST CSF, VSA (Vendor Security Alliance questionnaire), GDPR readiness, ISO 27001 controls questionnaire, Privacy Shield principles checklist**, etc. These templates are provided out-of-the-box ([Thoropass recognized as a leader in the G2 Winter 2025 Grid Reports including Audit Management, Cloud Compliance, and more - Thoropass](https://thoropass.com/blog/announcements/g2-winter-grid-reports/#:~:text=,ISO%2027001%2C%20Privacy%20Shield%2C%20etc)) and maintained (updated versions when standards change).
- **Custom Questionnaire Builder:** Customers (and potentially vendors for internal use) can create their own questionnaires within the platform. A questionnaire builder should allow adding questions of various types (Yes/No, multiple-choice, open text, file attachment required) and organizing them into sections/domains. Custom questionnaires might be used for specialized assessments (e.g., a custom cloud risk questionnaire or a privacy impact assessment form).
- **Question Bank / Reusable Questions:** To aid questionnaire creation, provide a question bank or repository. Users can select common questions from the library (e.g., from the SIG or from a library of previously used questions) instead of writing from scratch. This ensures consistency and saves time.
- **Answer Repository / Knowledge Base:** Vendors should not have to answer the same question repeatedly. The platform shall store vendor’s answers to questions in a repository linked to their profile. If a new questionnaire shares questions with one the vendor answered before (either identical or very similar, perhaps determined by an ID or text match), the system should auto-suggest the previous answer. For example, if a vendor already answered “Do you encrypt data at rest?” in the CAIQ, and then gets a custom questionnaire with that question, the platform can pre-fill that answer for review.
- **Support for Evidence Attachment:** Some questionnaire answers require evidence (e.g., attach a policy document or screenshot proof). The questionnaire response functionality should allow vendors to attach files or links as part of an answer.
- **Mapping Between Frameworks:** A more advanced feature: the system could map questions between frameworks (for instance, know that “ISO 27001 A.12.3.1” maps to certain questions in the SIG or CAIQ). This way, a single answer can populate multiple questionnaires. (This may be a phase 2 feature due to complexity.)
- **Scoring & Logic:** For customers, the platform can support scoring questionnaires (assigning risk scores or compliance percentages to a completed questionnaire). It can also support basic logic in questionnaires (e.g., if vendor says “No” to having a DR plan, that triggers a flag or follow-up question). Scoring models might be customizable per questionnaire or use default weighting provided by standards.
- **Import/Export:** To facilitate adoption, allow importing questionnaire responses from common formats (CSV, Excel). Likewise, allow exporting any questionnaire (blank or filled) to Excel/PDF for offline review or record-keeping, since some customers might still require an offline copy.
- **Collaborative Response:** For lengthy questionnaires, vendors may need multiple people to contribute. The platform should allow a vendor user to assign sections or questions to different internal collaborators (each with their own login). For example, assign all “DevOps” questions to a DevOps manager to answer. The system shows overall progress (e.g., 20 of 50 questions answered, with reminders to collaborators as deadlines approach).

### 3. Assessment Workflow & Request Management

These features enable the structured process of a customer assessing a vendor – including requesting info, tracking progress, and approval steps.

- **Initiate Assessment Request:** A customer user (risk analyst) can formally initiate an assessment of a vendor through the platform. This could create an “assessment case” or project record. They choose the vendor (from the directory or by inviting a new one) and select what is required (e.g., “Request completion of SIG Lite questionnaire and upload of SOC 2 report” or “Review shared profile only”). The system then packages those requests to the vendor.
- **Task/Request Tracking:** Once initiated, the platform generates tasks: both on the vendor side (e.g., “Complete SIG Lite questionnaire for BetaBank” assigned to the vendor) and on the customer side (e.g., “Review Acme’s responses” for the analyst). Each task has a status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed) and due date. The vendor sees a dashboard of “Requests from your customers” with details.
- **Automated Workflows:** The platform should support simple workflow logic. For example, when a vendor completes a questionnaire, the system can automatically mark the task done and notify the customer to review. If the customer is satisfied, they can mark the whole assessment as completed. Possibly, allow multi-step workflows such as an initial triage review by a junior analyst, then a final approval by a manager.
- **Communication & Q&A:** Within an assessment, provide a discussion thread or Q&A section. This allows clarifications without resorting to email. For example, a customer can comment on a specific questionnaire answer: “This answer is unclear, can you elaborate?” The vendor receives this comment and can reply in context. All such communication is logged in the assessment record.
- **NDA Handling:** If a customer requires an NDA before a vendor shares sensitive info, the workflow should include that. e.g., when BetaBank initiates an assessment for Acme, BetaBank might require Acme to digitally sign BetaBank’s NDA. The platform can present the NDA, capture acceptance (with e-signature or simple accept log), and then allow Acme to proceed with uploading confidential docs. Conversely, if Acme requires the customer to accept Acme’s NDA to see certain docs, the platform handles that during the sharing process (as described in sharing features).
- **Status Visibility:** Both parties should have a clear view of the assessment status. The vendor can see, for example, “Acme – BetaBank Assessment: SIG – Completed, Documents – 1 pending (DPA upload due by Aug 30)”. The customer sees a mirror image: “Acme Corp – In Progress: awaiting DPA”. When all items are completed and reviewed, the customer can mark the assessment as done.
- **Multiple Assessments & Reuse:** The vendor might be undergoing assessments from multiple customers at once. The platform should manage this without duplicate effort. If two customers request the same standard questionnaire, ideally the vendor can re-use or share the previously completed one (if allowed). The system might ask “Customer X is requesting SIG Lite – you have one completed last month, would you like to share those responses or fill a new one?” This way, one vendor response can satisfy many customers, aligning with the “assess once, share many” concept.
- **Approval and Risk Rating:** After review, the customer can record an outcome. The platform should allow the customer to mark the vendor’s status internally (e.g., Approved, Approved with Conditions, Rejected) and capture a risk rating or summary. This result might be visible to certain users (e.g., procurement) and can trigger notifications or integration outputs. It also links to the next re-assessment date automatically (e.g., set next review in 12 months).
- **Template Workflows:** Allow definition of different assessment “types” or templates. For instance, a lightweight assessment for low-risk vendors (maybe just review the profile, no extra questions) vs. a heavy assessment for critical vendors (full SIG, onsite audit, etc.). When initiating, the user can choose a type which pre-defines the tasks required. This ensures consistency in how different categories of vendors are handled.

### 4. Profile Sharing & External Access

This domain focuses on features that let vendors share their profile externally and customers (or prospects) access vendor information easily, subject to permissions.

- **Public/Private Profile Links:** Vendors can generate shareable links to their profile. Options include a **public link** (anyone with the URL can view a defined subset of the profile, typically non-sensitive info for marketing transparency) and **private invite** links (which require the recipient to log in and be explicitly granted access by the vendor).
- **Embedded Trust Center Widget:** The platform provides an embeddable widget or a public mini-site for the vendor’s “Trust Center.” This could be a snippet of HTML/script that the vendor embeds on their website’s Trust or Security page. It would display dynamic content (like compliance badges or a summary of the profile) and a button like “Request Access to Full Security Profile.” Clicking that could lead the user into the platform (or a branded portal) to request access from the vendor.
- **Access Request Workflow:** When an external party (e.g., a prospective customer) lands on a vendor’s public Trust Center and wants more info (like to see detailed docs), they can hit a “Request Access” button. The platform should capture their info (name, email, company, and maybe enforce NDA at this point). The vendor’s compliance team gets a notification and can approve or deny the access request. If approved, the user gets added as an authorized viewer of that vendor’s profile (possibly limited in time, e.g., access for 30 days).
- **NDA and Terms Management:** Vendors should be able to configure an NDA or terms of use that external viewers must accept before viewing certain parts of a profile. The platform can either use a standard NDA text that the vendor uploads or integrate an e-sign process. At minimum, logging an acceptance with timestamp is required. Once accepted, the user can see the restricted documents.
- **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Within a shared profile, vendors can decide which sections or documents are visible to which audience. For instance, a vendor might allow “all logged-in customers on the platform” to see their high-level questionnaire answers, but only allow specific invited companies to download the detailed architecture diagram. The system might implement this via tagging documents as “public, logged-in users only, or require explicit approval.”
- **Tracking and Analytics on Shares:** The platform should track every external access: who viewed the profile, what they clicked or downloaded, and when. Vendors (and possibly customers who initiated a share) can see analytics like “Profile X was viewed by Y users from Company Z on these dates.” This is useful feedback for vendors to know engagement, and also provides a trail for security (knowing exactly who has their materials).
- **Secure Download & Watermarking:** When a prospect or customer downloads a PDF document (like a policy) via the platform, optionally the system could apply a watermark (e.g., “Provided by Acme via [Platform] to GammaTech on 2025-08-01, for evaluation only”) to discourage leaks and trace any unauthorized distribution. This is a security feature some vendors will want.
- **Expiration of Access:** Vendors should be able to set an expiration on shared access. For example, share the profile with Prospect X for 30 days. After that, the link expires and Prospect X would need a renewal. The platform should handle this automatically, possibly sending a reminder to the prospect that access will expire and to request extension if needed, with vendor approval.

### 5. Notifications & Alerts

This covers the platform’s notification system, ensuring users are alerted to relevant events and upcoming tasks.

- **Email and In-App Notifications:** For all key events (request assigned, request completed, access granted, comment posted, etc.), the platform generates notifications. Users can see notifications in the app (e.g., an icon or dashboard) and also receive email summaries. Examples: Vendor gets “BetaBank has requested you complete SIG Lite by Sept 10.” Customer gets “Acme Corp uploaded the requested DPA, review it here.”
- **Configurable Preferences:** Users (or at least organization admins) can configure which notifications to receive or to batch. For instance, a vendor might want immediate email alerts for new requests but daily digests for less urgent things. The system should provide settings to avoid notification fatigue.
- **Reminders for Due Dates:** Before a task is due, if it’s not completed, the system sends reminder notifications. e.g., 1 week before, 1 day before due. These reminders go to the responsible party (and possibly CC their manager or an alternate contact if they are unresponsive). Overdue notifications similarly are sent.
- **Escalation Alerts:** If a request is overdue by a certain time, additional alerts could be sent. For example, notify a higher role at the vendor (maybe the CISO) that “The security questionnaire for Client X is 5 days overdue.” Or notify the customer’s manager that the vendor hasn’t responded.
- **Renewal & Expiry Alerts:** The system tracks expirations (certificate expiry dates, contract review dates, profile access expiry). It should send alerts in advance. e.g., “Vendor X’s cert will expire in 30 days” to both vendor (to update it) and customers who rely on that cert (so they know vendor might be non-compliant if not renewed). Another: “It’s been nearly a year since you assessed Vendor Y – consider launching a re-assessment.”
- **System Health and Security Alerts:** (Platform admin perspective) – if suspicious activity occurs (like multiple failed logins or data download spikes), the system could alert the affected user or admin. (This is more of a platform security aspect, possibly covered under Security section, but worth noting if any user-facing alert is needed.)
- **Integrations for Notifications:** Support sending notifications to other channels via integration – e.g., Slack or Microsoft Teams alerts. (Detailed under Integration, but the requirement is that the notification system can trigger external webhooks or use API for such channels.)

### 6. User Management & Access (Roles & Permissions)

These features govern how different users and roles interact with the system, ensuring security and appropriate segregation of data.

- **Organization Accounts and Users:** The platform distinguishes between different organizations (tenants), primarily “Vendor organizations” and “Customer organizations.” Each organization can have multiple user accounts. The system needs to ensure users from one organization cannot see data of another unless explicitly shared (multi-tenant security).
- **Roles and Permissions:** Provide a set of roles for each side:
  - For Vendors: e.g., **Vendor Admin** (full control over profile, can manage users), **Editor** (can edit profile content, respond to requests), **Read-Only/Viewer** (can see the profile and incoming requests but not edit). Possibly also a **Sales role** that can only share the profile but not alter it.
  - For Customers: e.g., **Risk Manager/Admin** (can create assessments, approve vendors, manage team), **Analyst** (can perform assessments, but maybe not configure templates), **Viewer** (stakeholders who can view assessment results but not initiate).
  - Roles should be configurable or at least cover common needs. We should enforce least privilege (e.g., a sales user at a vendor shouldn’t accidentally change questionnaire answers, just share them).
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Enterprises will want SSO integration (via SAML, OAuth) for enterprise users. The platform should support SSO for both vendor and customer orgs (this is detailed in Integration section). But from a requirement view: users should be able to authenticate either by platform credentials or via an SSO configured for their org.
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** If not using SSO, the platform should support two-factor auth for security-sensitive accounts (especially vendor admins and customer admins). Possibly SMS or authenticator app integration.
- **User Invitation & Approval:** Org admins can invite new users to their organization on the platform. For customers, when a vendor shares a profile with a new person, that person goes through a registration flow as described. We should have a way to verify their email (email confirmation) to ensure they are who they claim (especially important if access is being granted).
- **Access Control for Data:** Ensure that customers can only see vendor profiles that are either public or explicitly shared with them. Conversely, vendors should only see requests and information from customers that pertain to them. There may also be a concept of a global catalog where some vendor information (like name, basic summary) is visible to all customers (to facilitate discovery). If a vendor wants to remain completely private (only accessible if invited), that should be an option as well.
- **Audit Logs:** Every important action (user login, profile edit, document upload, download by a customer, permission change, etc.) should be logged. Org admins (and the platform operator) should be able to view logs for security and compliance audits. For instance, vendor admin might see “User X downloaded document Y on date” or “User Z changed answer to question 10 on CAIQ at time.” This is crucial for traceability.

### 7. Reporting & Analytics

The platform should provide reporting features to both vendors and customers to derive insights and prove compliance.

- **Dashboard Overview:** Upon login, users see a dashboard summarizing key info. For a vendor: number of profile views this month, number of outstanding requests, profile completion level, upcoming expirations, etc. For a customer: number of vendors, risk breakdown (e.g., X high-risk, Y medium, Z low), assessments in progress, overdue tasks, upcoming renewals, etc.
- **Pre-Built Reports:** Include some standard reports or charts. Examples:
  - For Customers: “Vendor Risk Posture Report” showing all vendors and their statuses (e.g., 10 approved, 2 pending, 1 high risk), “Assessment Turnaround Times” per vendor (how long each took to complete), or “Compliance Gaps” (which standard questions vendors often answer “No” to, indicating common weaknesses).
  - For Vendors: “Profile Engagement” (which customers viewed or requested profile, how many invites sent vs accepted), “Time to Complete Requests” (to gauge their responsiveness), and maybe “Benchmarking” (how their profile completeness or ratings compare to industry averages, if data available).
- **Custom Reports and Export:** Users should be able to export data (CSV, PDF) for inclusion in internal reports. For instance, a customer might export a summary of Acme’s assessment to attach to an internal risk memo. Or export a list of all vendors and whether they have a certain certification. If possible, allow some filtering and custom query in the UI to generate these lists.
- **Metrics for Program Improvement:** The product should help our customers measure their vendor risk program. For example, show things like “Average time to assess a vendor this quarter vs last quarter” (to demonstrate efficiency gains). Vendors might see “Number of questionnaires avoided by using your profile” if the system can calculate that (for example, “5 customers accepted your CAIQ instead of sending you a new questionnaire”).
- **Real-time Analytics:** If feasible, some elements like notifications on new risk events (ties to continuous monitoring if integrated) can be displayed. But mostly, reports can be refreshed on-demand or delivered periodically (e.g., monthly summary email to a CISO with platform stats).
- **Compliance Reporting:** The platform can assist in compliance audits (like ISO or SOC 2 for the customer’s vendor management process) by producing a report of all vendor assessments completed in a period, including evidence that due diligence was done. This is more of a customer-side need, ensuring that if an auditor asks “show me you assessed all high-risk vendors last year,” the tool can produce that evidence.
- **Usage Analytics for Us (the Platform Team):** (Not necessarily exposed to customers) The product should track its own usage (as in Metrics & KPIs section) so we can see adoption and performance and make data-driven improvements.

## UI/UX Wireframe Guidelines

The user interface should be intuitive, modern, and aligned with the workflows described. This section provides guidelines on how the UI/UX should be structured for a smooth user experience. Key principles include clarity, consistency, and responsiveness (supporting use on various screen sizes).

**General Design Principles:**

- Use a clean layout with a clear navigation menu (e.g., a sidebar or top menu) separating major sections: Dashboard, Vendors/Assessments, Questionnaires, Documents, Settings, etc.
- Ensure consistency in design elements (colors, typography, iconography) to establish trust. Security-related info (like risk status) can be highlighted with appropriate color-coding (e.g., green/yellow/red indicators).
- Make important status information visible at a glance (dashboards with counters, progress bars, notifications).
- Support responsive design: the application should be usable on common browsers and tablets; a mobile-friendly view for certain features (like responding to a questionnaire or checking status) is desirable.
- Provide helpful guidance within the UI: tooltips, inline descriptions, placeholders in forms (for example, under a questionnaire question, provide a tip or example answer format). Especially on the vendor side, a progress indicator or checklist for profile completeness improves usability.

**Vendor-Side UI:**

- **Vendor Dashboard:** Upon login, vendor users see a dashboard summarizing their profile status and tasks. For example, “Profile Completion: 85% – complete missing sections”, “3 new access requests from customers”, “Next certification renewal in 60 days”. This dashboard should have quick links to update profile or respond to requests.
- **Profile Editor:** A dedicated section for managing the company profile. This can be divided into tabs or accordion sections for each major category (Company Info, Security Practices, Certifications, Documents, Questionnaire Responses). Each section has edit capabilities. For example, the “Certifications” tab might list each certification with an edit or upload button. The UI should clearly denote which sections are visible publicly vs restricted (perhaps with an icon or toggle next to each item).
- **Document Management UI:** Within the profile editor or a separate Documents library page, vendors can see all uploaded files in a table (file name, type, upload date, expiry). They should be able to filter by type (e.g., show only Policies). Uploading a new document should be straightforward: clicking “Add Document” opens a form to choose file, select type from a dropdown, and add notes. Already uploaded documents can be updated or replaced; version history can be accessible via a small history icon.
- **Questionnaire Response UI:** When filling out a questionnaire (standard or custom) the UI should present one question or a small group of questions at a time (to avoid overwhelming long scroll). It might use a multi-step form wizard (e.g., “Section 1 of 5: Network Security – 10 questions”). Each question’s field (Yes/No, text, etc.) is clearly labeled, with help text if needed. If an answer was previously provided (from the answer repository), it should appear for review (with a note like “Pre-filled from your CAIQ responses – please confirm or update”). Save progress and resume later capability is important (show progress bar 50% complete). Also, allow jumping between sections via a sidebar menu of the questionnaire domains.
- **Requests/Tasks Page:** Vendors need a view listing all outstanding requests from customers. This could be similar to an email inbox or task list. Each item shows the requesting company, type of request (e.g., “Complete Questionnaire X” or “Upload Document Y”), and due date. Possibly color-code or sort by urgency (overdue at top). Clicking an item takes the user to the specific interface to fulfill it (e.g., opens the questionnaire form or a dialog to upload the document).
- **Sharing & Access Management:** Vendors should have a UI to manage how their profile is shared. For instance, a “Share Profile” button that opens a dialog to enter an email to invite, set an expiration, and require NDA yes/no. Also, a list of all active shares: e.g., “Shared with: BetaBank (full access), GammaTech (access until Oct 1)”. From here the vendor can revoke or extend access, and see NDA statuses (like a checkmark if accepted). If a public trust page is enabled, that can be toggled on/off here, and the public URL displayed for copy.
- **Notifications Center:** While email will be primary for alerts, within the UI an icon (bell) or panel should show recent notifications (which can mirror the task list for actionable items, plus things like “Your profile was viewed by X”). Clicking a notification navigates to the relevant item. Unread notifications should be highlighted.
- **Settings:** Vendors have settings for their organization (manage users, configure SSO, set notification preferences). The UI should allow a Vendor Admin to invite team members (enter email, assign role) and see existing users with their roles. Also settings such as default NDA text, company logo upload (for branding their profile page), and integration settings (like API keys or CRM connection if used).

**Customer-Side UI:**

- **Customer Dashboard:** On login, a customer risk manager sees a summary: “Vendors: 50 total (10 high risk requiring attention)”, “Assessments in Progress: 3”, “Pending tasks: e.g., review Acme’s response by Friday”. Possibly charts like risk tier distribution. This helps prioritize their work. It should also show notifications such as “Vendor X updated their profile” or “Vendor Y’s assessment is overdue” as alerts.
- **Vendor Catalog/Search:** Customers need an easy way to find vendors. A page listing vendors either in a table or card view. Include a search bar and filters (by status, risk level, category). For instance, filter to “vendors pending approval” or search by name. Each vendor entry shows basic info (name, maybe an icon of their compliance badges, perhaps an overall risk score if previously assessed). If the vendor is not on the platform yet, the UI might show an option “Invite Vendor” right from the search results (“Can’t find Acme? Send them an invite”).
- **Vendor Profile View:** When a customer user clicks a vendor (e.g., Acme Corp), they see the vendor’s profile in view mode. It should be similar layout to how the vendor sees it, but without edit options. Sections like certifications (with download links for files), questionnaire answers (view-only, possibly with an option to export if needed). If some content is restricted and not yet shared, it might show placeholders or a button “Request access to this item”. The UI should clearly indicate what is available and what is not (e.g., a lock icon on a document that requires vendor approval to access).
- **Assessment Workflow UI:** If the customer wants to initiate or manage an assessment, they might have a dedicated interface or panel in the vendor’s profile view. For example, a sidebar or tab “Assessments” showing any current or past assessments of that vendor. To launch a new one, a button “New Assessment” could open a wizard: choose questionnaire(s) or requests, set due dates, and send. For ongoing assessments, the UI might show a checklist of required items with status (similar to how vendor sees tasks). The customer can click into a questionnaire response to review answers in a side-by-side or Q&A format (perhaps showing the question, the vendor’s answer, and a field for the reviewer’s comment or risk rating).
- **Review & Approval Screen:** After an assessment is completed, a customer might have a screen to record their evaluation. This could be a form where they mark the vendor’s risk level, add internal notes, and click “Approve vendor” or similar. That action could be done via a modal or a dedicated page.
- **Multi-Vendor Comparison (optional):** For scenarios like RFPs with multiple vendors, a nice-to-have is a compare view where a customer can select two vendors and compare their profile data side by side (e.g., which one has more certs, or differences in questionnaire answers). This is advanced and not core, but if included, UI should highlight differences clearly.
- **Reporting UI:** A section where the customer can run reports (accessible by managers). Might be under “Reports” in nav. The UI could present a list of available reports or allow building a query (via forms). Results might display as tables or charts with export options. This is more back-office oriented.
- **Admin Settings (Customer):** Similar to vendor, customers have org settings: manage their users/roles, notification settings, integration settings (e.g., connect to their internal GRC or configure SSO). The UI should allow adding/removing users, assigning roles to ensure only authorized personnel can, say, approve vendors. Also, things like customizing risk scoring criteria might be in settings (like define what makes a vendor high risk in their context – number of “No” answers, etc., if the system allows such config).

**UX Considerations:**

- **Guided Onboarding:** For new users (vendor or customer), use guided tours or tooltips to explain how to use the platform on first login. For example, highlight “This is your profile completeness. Click here to start filling it out.”
- **Error Prevention & Validation:** The UI should validate inputs (e.g., if a user enters an invalid date or leaves required fields blank, prompt them clearly). It should also warn if leaving a page with unsaved changes.
- **Performance on Large Questionnaires:** For something like SIG with hundreds of questions, ensure the UI is optimized (maybe loading questions in chunks or lazy-loading) so it doesn’t become sluggish. Possibly provide a search within a questionnaire for the vendor to quickly find a question or keyword.
- **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility. This includes proper labels for screen readers, sufficient color contrast (especially when using risk colors), and keyboard navigability. Given the platform may be used by compliance officers, accessibility is important for inclusivity and also often required for enterprise software.
- **Branding/White-labeling:** Consider that some enterprises might want the platform to reflect their branding (especially the Trust Center on vendor’s site). The UI should allow adding a company logo and perhaps theme colors to the vendor’s public profile view so it feels like an extension of their brand. Similarly, email notifications sent by the system might be co-branded (e.g., “[Platform] on behalf of Acme Corp”).
- **Internationalization (Future):** If targeting global users, design the UI to accommodate different languages and text lengths (make sure layouts are flexible for translated text). This can be a future requirement but worth keeping in mind in design phase.

Wireframes and mockups would be developed to illustrate these screens in detail. The above guidelines ensure the UX aligns with user expectations and supports the complex workflows (like filling long questionnaires or managing many vendors) in a user-friendly way.

## Technical Architecture Overview

The platform will be designed as a scalable, secure multi-tenant SaaS application. This section outlines the high-level architecture components and design considerations.

**Architecture Components:**

- **Web Front-End:** A single-page application (SPA) for the user interface, built with a modern web framework (e.g., React or Angular). This front-end communicates with the backend via APIs. It handles rendering of dashboards, forms (questionnaires), file uploads, etc. The UI should be optimized for performance (lazy loading heavy components like large tables or forms as needed).
- **Application Backend:** A server-side application providing the core business logic and API endpoints. This could be structured as a monolithic app or a set of microservices depending on scale. Key logical services could include:
  - _Profile Service:_ Manages vendor profiles, fields, documents metadata.
  - _Questionnaire Service:_ Manages templates, questions, and responses.
  - _Assessment Workflow Service:_ Handles assessment requests, task status, and communication between parties.
  - _Notification Service:_ Schedules and sends out notifications (emails, etc.).
  - _Access Control/Sharing Service:_ Manages permissions, share links, and NDA logic.
    These could be separate modules but will work in concert. The backend would expose a RESTful API (and/or GraphQL) used by the front-end and external integrations.
- **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) to store structured data: user accounts, organizations, profile details, questionnaire responses, tasks, comments, etc. The schema will be multi-tenant (data rows tagged by organization/vendor ID for isolation). Ensure proper indexing for fast retrieval (e.g., indexing vendor names for search). For certain data like questionnaire answers, a flexible schema or JSON storage might be used to accommodate dynamic question sets.
- **File Storage:** A scalable object storage (like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or on-prem equivalent) for storing uploaded documents securely. The system will store references to files in the DB but the files themselves (PDFs, etc.) in the storage. Enable encryption-at-rest and set proper access controls (files accessible only via the app, using temporary signed URLs or backend proxy, to prevent direct unauthorized access).
- **Search Engine (Optional):** If complex searching/filtering is needed (e.g., full-text search within profiles or documents), integrating a search engine like Elasticsearch could be beneficial. For initial requirements, database queries may suffice, but as data grows, a search service could offload queries (for example, searching all questionnaire answers for a keyword).
- **Workflow & Notification Scheduler:** The platform likely needs background job processing. For example, a scheduler to trigger daily checks for upcoming deadlines and send emails, or to process heavy tasks like generating a big report. A component like a job queue (RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, or a cron-based scheduler service) will be part of the architecture to handle these asynchronous tasks.
- **APIs & Integration Layer:** All functionality should be exposed via secure APIs. This not only powers the front-end but also allows integration (detailed later). Possibly separate API gateway or endpoints for external integration (with appropriate authentication like API keys or OAuth tokens for clients). Webhooks can be part of this layer to notify external systems of events (e.g., “Vendor submitted questionnaire”).
- **Security Components:** The architecture includes components to enforce security: an authentication service (managing logins, password hashing, SSO integration), authorization checks (ensuring users can only access their org’s data), and input validation layers to prevent injection attacks. Additionally, an audit logging mechanism will record events and store logs (maybe in a separate logging service or at least separate DB table).
- **Deployment & Infrastructure:** The application will be deployed on a cloud infrastructure for reliability and scalability. For example, containerized microservices orchestrated by Kubernetes, or a serverless architecture where appropriate (some parts could be on AWS Lambda, though long-running tasks like file processing might need containers). Use a multi-tier environment: development, staging, production. Production should be multi-availability-zone for high availability. Use load balancers to distribute traffic across instances.
- **Scalability & Performance:** The system should be designed to handle increasing load – e.g., if thousands of vendors and customers onboard. This means being able to scale horizontally: spin up more app servers under load, and ensure the DB is robust (using read replicas or partitioning if needed as usage grows). Caching layers might be employed (like Redis) for frequently accessed data (e.g., caching static reference data or user session info) to reduce DB hits.
- **Backup & Disaster Recovery:** Regular backups of the database and file storage must be planned (daily snapshots, etc.). The architecture should include recovery strategies – for example, point-in-time restore for the DB, redundant storage for files. Also, a disaster recovery environment in a different region could be considered for enterprise readiness.
- **DevOps and CI/CD:** Maintain infrastructure as code (Terraform or similar) for reproducibility. Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines to test and deploy changes smoothly. Monitoring tools (like CloudWatch, New Relic, etc.) will observe system health (CPU, memory, response times, error rates) to catch performance issues or downtime quickly.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** The architecture will interface with external services for certain functions: an email service (e.g., SendGrid or SES) to send notifications, an e-signature service if needed for NDAs (e.g., DocuSign API or a simple built-in e-signature), and SSO providers (via SAML integration modules). Design the system to easily plug these in or replace as needed (using abstraction layers or adapters for external APIs).

**Data Flow Considerations:**

- When a vendor user uploads a document via the front-end, it goes to the backend which stores metadata in DB and the file in object storage. On retrieval, the front-end requests the file via an API call, the backend verifies permissions and either streams the file or provides a temporary link.
- When a customer sends a questionnaire request, the backend creates tasks in DB, the notification service triggers an email to the vendor. The vendor logs in, front-end fetches the task via API, vendor submits answers, which go through backend logic (maybe some validation), get saved in DB. Then the customer is notified via a webhook or email, etc.
- For real-time updates (like seeing a task marked completed without refresh), consider using WebSocket or a lighter approach like periodic polling. Real-time isn’t critical for most flows, but it improves user experience (e.g., if both vendor and customer are online concurrently, a customer could see a form being completed in real-time). This could be a later enhancement.

**Multi-Tenancy and Isolation:**

- All data queries must enforce tenant isolation (e.g., using organization IDs in queries, or separate schema per tenant if that model is chosen). Under no circumstances should one client’s data leak to another.
- Where attachments or links are shared, ensure they are only accessible if the requester has appropriate auth (e.g., by checking token against access control lists).
- The architecture should be penetration-tested and threat-modeled to ensure data integrity and privacy.

This technical design ensures the platform will be robust, maintainable, and secure, capable of supporting the complex features outlined while remaining performant for end-users.

## Data Models and APIs

This section defines the core data model (main objects and their relationships) and outlines the API approach for the platform.

**Core Data Entities:**

- **Organization:** Represents a company on the platform (either a vendor, a customer, or both). Key fields: organization name, type/role (vendor/customer), industry, etc. It links to Users (members of the org) and to the vendor Profile (if the org is a vendor). If an organization is both a vendor and a customer (possible in some cases), it would have both roles.
- **User:** An individual user account, associated with an Organization. Fields: name, email, role (within their org), authentication details (password hash or SSO identifier). Relationships: User belongs to one Organization; a User can have one or more Roles (which grant permissions).
- **Vendor Profile:** The central record for a vendor’s security & privacy information. There is typically one Profile per vendor Organization. It includes sub-sections or related records:
  - Basic attributes: description, headquarters, etc.
  - Compliance attributes: (could be structured as separate fields or separate related entities) e.g., SOC 2 = true/false + latest audit date, ISO 27001 = true/false + cert ID, GDPR-compliant = yes/no.
  - It links to multiple **Documents** (the evidence files uploaded).
  - It links to zero or more **Questionnaire Responses** (the answers the vendor has provided to various questionnaires).
  - It has settings for sharing (e.g., public or private, NDA required).
- **Document:** An uploaded file metadata record. Fields: filename, file type category (enum: policy, certification, etc.), vendor org owner, upload date, expiry date (if applicable), storage reference (e.g., S3 URL or ID). Relationships: belongs to a Vendor Profile. Also possibly linked to an Assessment if it was provided for a specific request.
- **Questionnaire Template:** Represents a set of questions (like CAIQ, SIG, or a custom set). Fields: title, type (standard vs custom), version. Relationships: has many Questions. If custom, it might belong to the Customer org that created it (or it could be global if shared).
- **Question:** Represents a single question in a questionnaire template. Fields: question text, description, answer type (yes/no, multi-choice, text, etc.), possibly a reference code (like mapping to a control ID). Relationships: belongs to a Questionnaire Template. (For standardized templates, these come pre-populated in the system.)
- **Questionnaire Response:** Captures a vendor’s answers to a specific Questionnaire Template. This could be modeled as:
  - A parent object (Response) with fields: template ID, vendor org, date completed, related Assessment (if filled for a particular customer assessment).
  - And child objects **Answer** for each question: storing question ID, answer value, and optionally commentary or attachment reference if evidence was attached.
    Alternatively, in a simpler model, the Questionnaire Response could be a JSON blob of answers mapped by question ID. However, using an Answer table makes it easier to query specific answers (like for reuse).
- **Assessment / Assessment Request:** Represents an assessment process initiated by a customer for a vendor. Fields: requesting customer org, target vendor org, creation date, status (in progress, completed), overall result (approved, etc.), due date. Relationships: it may link to one or multiple requested items, such as Questionnaire Responses or Document Requests.
- **Task/Request:** A finer-grained entity representing a specific request item within an Assessment. For example, “Fill out Questionnaire X” or “Upload Document Y”. Fields: type (questionnaire/document/other), status, due date, linked to the specific Questionnaire Template or Document type requested. Relationships: belongs to an Assessment, and might link to a resulting Document or Questionnaire Response once completed. This helps track progress at item level.
- **Comment/Discussion:** If we support Q&A discussion, an entity for comments would exist. Fields: author (user), text, timestamp. Relationship: linked to either an Assessment (general comments) or even specific questions or tasks if more granular.
- **Access Grant / Share:** Represents an external organization or user’s access to a vendor’s profile. Fields: vendor org, granted-to (could be a customer org or an individual external user email), access level (full profile or limited), expiration date, NDA accepted (bool, with date/time). Relationships: belongs to Vendor Profile, and if the viewer is a registered user, links to their User/Org.
- **Notification:** (Could be stored or just ephemeral) – Records of notifications sent or to be sent. Fields: type, recipient (user or org), message, read/unread, timestamp. This allows building an in-app notification list.
- **Audit Log:** (for internal/security use) Every significant event (login, data change, share, etc.) can be stored here. Fields: timestamp, user, action, entity affected, details. This is mostly for admin/audit purposes and might not be exposed via API to normal users but is crucial for compliance.

These are the primary data entities. The relationships can be summarized: An Organization has many Users. A Vendor Organization has one Profile (and many Documents, many Questionnaire Responses via that Profile). A Customer Organization has many Assessments. An Assessment links a Customer Org and Vendor Org and contains many Tasks. Questionnaire Templates have many Questions; Questionnaire Responses have many Answers. An Access Grant links a Vendor Profile to a Customer Org or external user for sharing.

**APIs:**

The platform will expose RESTful APIs for all major operations. The API follows REST conventions (using HTTPS with JSON payloads). Authentication will be required for all endpoints (except maybe a public endpoint for checking a public profile link), typically via a token (JWT issued at login or API key/ OAuth2 for integrations).

Example key API endpoints (not exhaustive):

- **Authentication & Org Management:**

  - `POST /api/v1/auth/login` – authenticate user and retrieve token.
  - `POST /api/v1/orgs/{orgId}/users` – invite or create a new user in an organization.
  - `GET /api/v1/orgs/{orgId}/users` – list users (requires admin token).

- **Vendor Profile & Documents:**

  - `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/profile` – fetch the full vendor profile (for an authorized viewer).
  - `PUT /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/profile` – update profile fields (vendor only).
  - `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/documents` – list document metadata.
  - `POST /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/documents` – upload a new document (perhaps a two-step process: one to get a secure upload URL, then upload file, or send file bytes directly if size is small).
  - `GET /api/v1/documents/{docId}/download` – download a document (if permitted; this may redirect to a signed URL or stream the file).

- **Questionnaires:**

  - `GET /api/v1/questionnaires/templates` – list available templates (standard and custom visible to the org).
  - `GET /api/v1/questionnaires/templates/{templateId}` – get template details including questions.
  - `POST /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/questionnaires/{templateId}/responses` – submit responses for a given template (vendor side).
  - `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/questionnaires/{templateId}/responses` – get the vendor’s filled response (for viewing by customer or vendor).
  - `POST /api/v1/orgs/{custOrgId}/questionnaires` – create a custom questionnaire template (customer side).

- **Assessments & Tasks:**

  - `POST /api/v1/assessments` – create a new assessment request. Body includes: customerOrg, vendorOrg, requestedItems (e.g., template IDs, document types).
  - `GET /api/v1/assessments/{assessId}` – get assessment status and details, including tasks.
  - `GET /api/v1/orgs/{custOrgId}/assessments?status=Pending` – list assessments initiated by a customer (with filters).
  - `PATCH /api/v1/assessments/{assessId}/tasks/{taskId}` – update task (customer might mark a task as reviewed, or vendor might mark as complete via filling a form – though completion is usually via specific endpoints like submitting a questionnaire which would auto-update the task).
  - `POST /api/v1/assessments/{assessId}/comments` – add a comment to an assessment discussion thread.

- **Sharing & Access:**

  - `POST /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/share` – vendor generates a share invite. Payload: target email or org, access level, expiry.
  - `POST /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/share/{shareId}/revoke` – vendor revokes a share.
  - `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/share/{shareId}/accept` – endpoint that the invited user hits to accept NDA and get access (this might be a special flow separate from pure API, possibly handled via a web page).
  - `GET /api/v1/vendors/discover?search=Acme` – search for vendors (customer use).

- **Notifications:**

  - `GET /api/v1/notifications` – get current user’s notifications.
  - (Most notification sending is internal; some maybe to integrate with external systems might be via webhooks or an outgoing integration API.)

- **Reporting:**
  - `GET /api/v1/reports/{reportName}` – e.g., `reports/vendor-risk-summary` – returns data needed for a specific report (or could be more query-based).
  - `GET /api/v1/orgs/{custOrgId}/vendors?filter=highrisk` – query capabilities to retrieve lists for reporting.

**API Design Considerations:**

- Use of standard HTTP response codes (200 for success, 401 for unauthorized, 404 for not found, 400 for validation errors, etc.).
- Pagination for list endpoints (e.g., if listing many vendors or questions).
- Filtering and search query parameters for endpoints like vendor listing or assessment listing.
- The API should enforce authorization rules: e.g., only the vendor org can POST their own questionnaire responses; only the customer who initiated an assessment can view that assessment’s details (unless sharing them internally).
- Input validation and size limits (for example, limit the size of file uploads, number of questions per custom questionnaire to reasonable limits).
- Webhooks: The system can offer webhook callbacks for events. For instance, a customer’s system could register a webhook for “assessment completed” event; when an assessment is marked completed, the platform sends a POST with details to the customer’s endpoint.
- Versioning: Prefix APIs with `/v1` (and plan for versioning strategy) to allow evolution without breaking clients.
- Rate limiting and security: Protect the APIs from abuse – e.g., rate limit login attempts to prevent brute force, use HTTPS only, and include audit logging for sensitive endpoints.

The data model and API design ensure that all functionality is accessible programmatically, which facilitates integration with other tools and allows future expansion (for example, a mobile app or third-party analytics tool could use these APIs). The models also ensure data integrity and clarity in how different pieces of information relate to each other in the system.

## Workflow Engine and Notification System

An effective workflow and notification system ensures that the right actions happen at the right times without manual tracking. This section details how the platform’s workflow engine coordinates tasks and how notifications are generated and delivered.

**Workflow Engine:**

- The platform will include a workflow orchestration component to manage multi-step processes (like vendor assessments). Each **Assessment** can be treated as a workflow instance with defined steps (e.g., “Send questionnaire to vendor” -> “Vendor completes questionnaire” -> “Analyst reviews” -> “Manager approves”). The engine moves the assessment through these stages based on triggers (events) and timing.
- We may implement this with a dedicated workflow engine library or framework, or via custom logic in our application. Key is that the state of each workflow (assessment) is tracked and can progress automatically. For example, when the vendor submits all required items, the system can automatically mark the assessment as ready for review and notify the analyst.
- **Rule Triggers:** The engine will have triggers based on events:
  - Event: A new assessment is created -> Action: generate tasks and assign to vendor.
  - Event: Vendor completes a task -> Action: mark task done, if all tasks done then notify customer.
  - Event: Due date reached and task not complete -> Action: mark as overdue and escalate notification.
  - Event: Customer approves assessment -> Action: close workflow, update vendor’s status, send final notifications (and schedule next review in X months).
- **Conditional Flow:** The workflow might allow conditional steps. For instance, if a vendor answers a critical question negatively, the workflow could add a task for the vendor to provide a mitigation plan. While not a Phase 1 requirement to fully automate such logic, the system design should allow adding such conditional rules later (maybe through configuration of question mappings to tasks).
- **Recurring Workflows:** The engine supports recurring triggers (for re-assessments). E.g., schedule an assessment workflow to start every year for each active vendor. This could be implemented via a scheduler that on a set interval creates new assessment records for vendors due for review, and then those follow the normal process.

**Notification System:**

- The notification system works closely with the workflow engine. It captures any event that requires informing a user and delivers notifications via appropriate channels.
- **Channels:** Initially, email is the primary channel for external notifications. In-app notifications (as discussed in UI) are also generated for logged-in users. Optionally, integrations can enable other channels like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or SMS for notifications (these can be configured in Integration settings if needed).
- **Email Notifications:** Every email template (e.g., “You have a new vendor request” or “Your questionnaire has been reviewed”) will be clearly written and can include dynamic data (vendor name, due dates, direct links to the platform etc.). The platform should have a templating system for emails to allow easy updates and localization if needed. Also, include the vendor or customer branding where appropriate (for example, when BetaBank’s system invites Acme, the email might display BetaBank’s name or logo along with the platform’s header, so the context is clear).
- **Reminder & Escalation:** The notification system will handle reminders as per schedule:
  - Before Due: Send reminder X days before a task due date to the responsible person.
  - Overdue: If past due, notify again and possibly escalate. Escalation rules (like who else gets copied) could be configurable. For instance, after 7 days overdue, email the vendor’s admin or the customer’s manager.
  - Expirations: For expiring documents or expiring access, generate notifications in advance (e.g., 30-day and 7-day warnings).
- **Digest vs Real-Time:** To prevent notification overload, users might get digest emails for less critical things. For example, a daily summary of “these 5 vendors updated their profiles today” instead of five separate emails. Critical items (like a direct request to you) should be sent immediately. The system’s notification preferences (per user or per org) will allow some tuning of this.
- **Notification Management:** Users can mark notifications as read (in-app) and possibly turn off certain types (e.g., a user might disable email for info that they check in-app anyway). Admins might be able to enforce some notifications to always go out (for compliance).
- **Audit of Notifications:** The system should log when notifications are sent (perhaps not every individual email, but at least that a task reminder was sent on X date) in case someone claims they weren’t notified, admins can verify.

**Integration with Workflow:**

- The workflow engine triggers notifications, but also can trigger external actions through integrations. For instance, when an assessment is completed, the system might call a webhook or send a message to an external system (like creating a record in a GRC tool – covered later).
- Conversely, the engine could accept external triggers. For example, if integrated with a ticketing system, closing a ticket there could trigger updating an assessment status here. However, such complex two-way sync would be a future consideration.

**Customization and Configuration:**

- In future versions, we might introduce a **Workflow Editor** for administrators, allowing them to define custom workflows or tweak steps for their organization’s process. For example, a customer could add an extra approval step by a legal team for cloud vendors. This would require a UI to manage custom workflow templates and assign them to vendor categories. Initially, we will hard-code standard workflow logic (common to most vendor assessments) but keep the architecture flexible for such extension.
- Notifications content might also be customizable to a degree (perhaps admins can edit the text of request emails or reminder emails to fit their tone or include additional instructions).

In summary, the workflow and notification system ensures that once an assessment or sharing process is kicked off, the platform guides it to completion with minimal manual oversight – automatically assigning tasks, nudging participants when needed, and keeping everyone informed. This automation is crucial to achieving the efficiency gains the platform promises.

## Security and Compliance Standards

Given the sensitive nature of the data (security assessments, compliance documents) and the platform’s role in trust management, strong security controls and regulatory compliance are paramount. This section outlines the standards the platform will adhere to and features ensuring security and privacy compliance.

**Platform Security Objectives:** The platform itself will be built to meet stringent security criteria, aiming for certifications such as **SOC 2 Type II** and **ISO 27001** for the service. This means implementing controls around security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of customer data.

**Data Security:**

- **Encryption at Rest and In Transit:** All sensitive data in the database (especially passwords, API keys, personal identifiable info) will be encrypted at rest. Documents stored will be encrypted in storage. All network communication will occur over TLS (HTTPS) to prevent eavesdropping. Optionally, field-level encryption can be used for particularly sensitive fields (so even DB admins can’t read certain content without the app).
- **Access Control:** Role-based access (discussed earlier) ensures users only access permitted data. Additionally, implement least privilege in the architecture: for example, the microservices or modules only have access to the data they need. Within the infrastructure, use VPCs, security groups, and firewall rules to limit access to databases and storage to only the application servers.
- **Authentication Security:** Support strong authentication (enforce strong passwords, 2FA, SSO integration). Protect against brute force (rate-limit login attempts, have lockout policies). Store credentials securely (bcrypt or scrypt hashing for passwords).
- **Session Management:** If using JWTs or session cookies, ensure they're securely configured (httpOnly, secure flag, short expiration, refresh mechanisms as needed). Invalidate sessions on password change or suspicious activity.
- **Activity Logging and Monitoring:** As mentioned, audit logs of user activity are kept. Additionally, security monitoring will be in place – e.g., the platform can integrate with a SIEM to monitor for anomalies (multiple failed logins, unusual download patterns, etc.). Alerts can be generated for the platform ops team if a breach attempt is suspected.
- **Data Isolation:** Multi-tenant data is logically isolated. We will regularly test that queries and API calls cannot retrieve data across organizations. Possibly implement tenant-specific encryption keys if needed (each org’s data encrypted with an org-specific key) – though that adds complexity, it’s an option for high security contexts.
- **Backups & Recovery Security:** Backups of data will also be encrypted. Access to backups is restricted. And in case of restore, procedures will ensure data integrity and consistency (and avoid mix-up of different tenants’ data).

**Application Security:**

- **Secure SDLC:** The development process will include security reviews, code analysis (using static code analysis tools for common vulnerabilities), and regular penetration testing by third-party experts. Threat modeling will be done for critical features (like the sharing mechanism) to anticipate and mitigate potential abuse (e.g., ensuring a shared link cannot be manipulated to access another vendor’s data).
- **OWASP Top 10 Mitigation:** The platform will be designed to guard against common web app vulnerabilities. For example:
  - Input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
  - Use parameterized queries/ORM for database access.
  - Implement strong anti-CSRF measures for state-changing requests (or use same-site cookies in modern approach).
  - Protect against IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References) by always checking the current user’s org against any data access.
  - File uploads will be scanned for malware, and certain types (like executables) might be disallowed or sanitized if not needed.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep the underlying software and libraries up to date to patch vulnerabilities. E.g., promptly apply security patches to the server OS, DB, and any third-party components.
- **Environment Security:** The cloud environment will follow best practices (e.g., AWS Well-Architected security principles). Secrets (API keys, DB passwords) will be stored in secure secret management service (not in code). No default passwords or open ports in production. Penetration tests will include the deployment environment.
- **Environment Hardening:** Only necessary services running on servers, use of container security scans, principle of immutability (infrastructure as code) to ensure consistency. Non-production environments will not use real customer data (to prevent dev leaks).

**Compliance and Regulatory:**

- **SOC 2 and ISO 27001:** As the platform matures, we plan to undergo SOC 2 Type II audit and possibly ISO 27001 certification for our internal processes. This demonstrates commitment to security controls. It means we will maintain policies for incident response, access management, change management, etc., and document and audit them. Many enterprise customers will require a SOC 2 report from us as the platform vendor.
- **GDPR and Privacy Laws:** The platform will be built in compliance with privacy regulations like **GDPR** and similar (CCPA/CPRA, etc.). Although most data in the system is business-related (vendor security info), it does include personal data such as user contact info and possibly names in documents. Compliance measures include:
  - Providing a clear privacy policy and user consent where appropriate.
  - Allowing deletion or return of data: e.g., if a customer leaves the platform, we can delete their data on request (right to erasure).
  - Data export ability (for data portability).
  - Ensuring that personal data of EU individuals can be hosted in EU data centers if required, or using approved transfer mechanisms (with the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework replacing Privacy Shield, we will comply with whichever framework is in effect for transatlantic data transfer ([Thoropass recognized as a leader in the G2 Winter 2025 Grid Reports including Audit Management, Cloud Compliance, and more - Thoropass](https://thoropass.com/blog/announcements/g2-winter-grid-reports/#:~:text=,ISO%2027001%2C%20Privacy%20Shield%2C%20etc))).
  - Signing Data Processing Addendums (DPAs) with our clients, where we commit to handling their data per GDPR requirements (acting as a data processor for the content they store on the platform).
- **Industry Standards Support:** The platform directly supports frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, and others in terms of content (questionnaires, etc.), but we also ensure our _implementation_ of those controls. For example, ISO 27001 requires access reviews – we could provide admin features for organizations to review their user access regularly.
- **Secure Hosting and Location Compliance:** We will choose reputable cloud hosting (e.g., AWS, Azure) which have a multitude of compliance certifications (SOC, ISO, FedRAMP if needed for government clients). We can offer region-specific hosting if clients require data residency (for instance, hosting an instance in EU for European customers to keep all data in-region, which helps with GDPR compliance and possibly required for some regulated industries).
- **Incident Response:** Establish an incident response plan for the platform (how we detect, respond, notify clients of any data breaches in a timely manner as required by law). This includes monitoring, having a team on call, and a communication plan aligned with standards like GDPR (72-hour breach notification rule when necessary).
- **Client-Side Controls:** Provide features to help our customers fulfill their obligations. For example, logs and reports that a customer might need to demonstrate to their auditors that they performed vendor due diligence using our platform (thus indirectly supporting their compliance to regulations like HIPAA or SOX if they must audit vendor risk processes).
- **Privacy by Design:** Minimizing the personal data we store – we will not unnecessarily collect data not needed for the platform’s function. For example, we don’t need end-user sensitive info like birthdays or ID numbers, so we won’t collect them. Only professional contact details and perhaps signatures on NDAs, etc., are stored, with care for their protection.

By adhering to these security and compliance standards, the platform will not only protect the data entrusted to it but also instill confidence in users (product managers can be assured that the feature set is backed by strong security underpinnings). Many of these considerations will be continuously evaluated as part of the platform’s operations and will be audited through formal programs (SOC 2/ISO) to ensure ongoing compliance.

## Integration Requirements

To maximize its usefulness and fit into enterprise ecosystems, the platform should integrate with other tools and systems. Key integration requirements include:

**CRM Integration (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot):**

- The platform should integrate with CRM systems to empower sales and account teams. For example, a Salesforce integration could allow a sales rep to initiate sharing of the vendor’s security profile directly from a Salesforce opportunity or account record. This might involve:
  - A Salesforce AppExchange package or plugin that adds a “Share Security Profile” button in Salesforce. Clicking it calls the platform (via API) to generate an invite link to the prospect.
  - Syncing basic profile information or status back to Salesforce: e.g., a custom field on the Account indicating “Security Review Status: Completed/Pending” that updates when an assessment is done on the platform.
- Similarly, for HubSpot or other CRMs, provide either a native integration or at least API/webhook support so that when a deal reaches a certain stage, an automated trigger could create an assessment request in our platform.
- The goal is to reduce toggling between systems – sales teams can trigger or monitor security review progress from the CRM they already use, and have visibility if a security review is gating a deal.

**GRC and Vendor Management Systems (e.g., ServiceNow, Archer):**

- Many larger organizations use Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) platforms or vendor management modules. The platform should offer integration points to these:
  - **ServiceNow Integration:** For example, if a company uses ServiceNow VRM, they might want any vendor assessment done on our platform to be reflected in ServiceNow. An integration could automatically create a record in ServiceNow when an assessment starts, update it when complete, and attach a summary or link back to our platform for details. Conversely, if a user initiates an assessment in ServiceNow, it could call our API to actually perform the questionnaire workflow.
  - **RSA Archer Integration:** Archer often holds an “authoritative” vendor record. We should allow exporting or syncing data like questionnaire results or risk ratings to Archer’s data fields. Possibly via CSV export/import or direct API if available. For instance, after completing an assessment, a user could click “Export to Archer” to get a file formatted for Archer’s Third Party Risk module, including fields like residual risk rating, assessment date, etc. ([Third Party Risk Management Use Case Design ](https://help.archerirm.cloud/thirdpty_riskmgmt_69/en-us/Content/Solutions/ThirdPtyGov/tpg_tprm_design.htm#:~:text=The%20Archer%20Engagement%20Risk%20Assessment,sustainability%2C%20and%20fourth%20party%20risk)) ([Third Party Risk Management Use Case Design ](https://help.archerirm.cloud/thirdpty_riskmgmt_69/en-us/Content/Solutions/ThirdPtyGov/tpg_tprm_design.htm#:~:text=Question%20Library)).
  - At minimum, provide comprehensive **APIs** and maybe a reference integration to ensure companies can connect the platform with their internal GRC/risk systems as needed.
- **Other Platforms:** Integration with IT service management or ticketing systems (JIRA, etc.) could be considered if, say, issues found in an assessment should generate remediation tickets. This is less critical but can be an extension (e.g., an API webhook: if a vendor fails a control, create a JIRA ticket assigned to the vendor manager to follow up).

**Single Sign-On (SSO) and Identity Providers:**

- Integration with enterprise identity systems is crucial for adoption. The platform must support SSO via SAML 2.0 and/or OAuth/OIDC. This means customers can integrate Okta, Azure AD, Ping Identity, or other IdPs so that their users can log in to the platform with corporate credentials.
- SSO integration involves providing metadata for the platform as a Service Provider (SP) and allowing configuration of SAML settings in an admin interface. It should support at least:
  - Just-in-Time provisioning (when a new user from the domain logs in via SSO, optionally auto-create their user account tied to the organization).
  - Role mapping if feasible (e.g., if IdP passes a group that indicates the user should be an admin vs user).
- In addition to SSO, integration with LDAP or SCIM APIs for user provisioning might be considered for automated user management.
- Also, integration with MFA solutions (though if SSO is used, MFA is handled by IdP; if not, the platform’s own 2FA can be used).

**Communication and Collaboration Tools:**

- **Slack / Microsoft Teams:** Provide optional integration so that notifications (or certain alerts) can be posted to a Slack channel or Teams. For example, when a vendor completes an assessment, the security team’s Slack channel gets a message. This could be done via webhooks or an app. We should allow customers to configure a few triggers for these (or just a general “all notifications to Slack” if piped through).
- **Email Systems:** While the platform will send emails itself, some clients may prefer emails come from their domain. Integration with their SMTP or email gateway could be considered (or at least using a verified sending domain). Also, ensure our email templates can be edited to some degree or at least co-branded – this might not be an “integration” but it’s related to fitting into their communications style.

**Security Data Integrations:**

- **Security Ratings Services:** Many vendor risk programs use external cyber ratings (e.g., SecurityScorecard, BitSight) to get continuous monitoring of vendors. Our platform could integrate by pulling a vendor’s rating and displaying it in their profile. For instance, via API, fetch a score and show “SecurityScorecard: B (730)” on the profile. This provides extra context to customers without them needing to separately check. This integration would require mapping vendor’s domain or company to the rating service. This is likely a later-phase feature, but designing the profile to accommodate an “External Ratings” section is good.
- **Compliance Databases:** E.g., integration with CSA STAR registry (Cloud Security Alliance’s registry) – as Whistic does – to import a vendor’s CAIQ if they have published it there. If a vendor signs up and their data is already in a public repository, we can save them effort by pulling it in.
- **Vulnerability Intel Feeds:** Possibly, integration with sources that might alert if a particular vendor had a breach (maybe via an API like HaveIBeenPwned or dark web monitoring). This is speculative and advanced – but such integration could alert the platform’s users to emerging risks (ties into continuous monitoring).

**Data Import/Export and API Access:**

- Provide data import capabilities to onboard data from other systems. For example, a customer might have a spreadsheet of all current vendors and their statuses – an import tool could create those records on our platform to get started.
- Bulk export: customers may want to export all their vendor risk info periodically to a data warehouse or for backup. We should offer export of all data in machine-readable format (JSON or CSV) for their own retention.
- A well-documented **Open API**: This allows customers or partners to build custom integrations beyond what we anticipate. The API (as described in Data Models & APIs) should be documented (Swagger/OpenAPI docs) and perhaps a developer portal provided. This way, a client could integrate, for example, their procurement system to automatically trigger an assessment when a new vendor is added in procurement.

**Integration Configuration & Security:**

- All integrations need secure authentication (e.g., OAuth tokens for CRM/GRC, API keys for webhooks). Provide a UI in admin settings for generating API keys and managing webhook endpoints (with secrets for validation).
- Ensure that integration failures (like if a webhook endpoint is down) are handled gracefully and logged for troubleshooting.
- Maintain modular integration code so new integrations can be added over time (e.g., using a plugin architecture or separate integration service where possible).
- Provide test sandboxes or staging credentials for clients to try out integrations safely (especially for API usage).

By offering these integration capabilities, the platform can embed itself within existing workflows of customers and vendors. This not only improves user adoption (less context-switching, more automation) but also makes the platform a central source of truth that complements other enterprise systems rather than existing in isolation.

## Metrics and KPIs

To measure the success of the Vendor Security & Privacy Assessment Platform, we will track a variety of key performance indicators (KPIs). These metrics help product managers understand usage patterns, the platform’s impact on efficiency, and areas for improvement.

**Adoption and Usage Metrics:**

- **Number of Vendor Profiles:** How many vendor organizations have created profiles on the platform. (Goal: Steady growth month over month; a high number indicates network effect and platform value).
- **Profile Completion Rate:** The average percentage of profile fields completed by vendors. (Goal: >90% completion on key fields for active vendors, ensuring quality of data).
- **Active Users (MAU/WAU):** Monthly and Weekly Active Users on the platform, split by vendors and customers. This shows engagement. (E.g., 500 active vendor users and 200 customer users per month).
- **User Retention:** The percentage of users/organizations that continue to use the platform over time (e.g., come back each month to perform tasks). High retention means the platform is essential to their workflow.
- **Number of Assessments Conducted:** Total count of vendor assessments completed through the system (e.g., “100 assessments completed this quarter”). Growth in this metric shows increased reliance on the platform for vendor vetting.
- **Vendors Invited vs Onboarded:** How many vendor invitations have been sent by customers and how many of those resulted in an active profile. This conversion rate indicates how easy/persuasive it is for vendors to join when asked by a customer.

**Efficiency and Process Improvement Metrics:**

- **Average Assessment Completion Time:** Time from when a customer initiates a vendor assessment to when it’s completed. We expect this to drop significantly with the platform (e.g., from an industry baseline of 4-6 weeks down to 1-2 weeks on average). We will track median and 90th percentile times.
- **Questionnaire Response Time:** For vendors, measure how quickly they respond to requests. For instance, average time to complete a standard questionnaire after request. Faster times indicate the platform’s tools (answer reuse, notifications) are effective.
- **On-Time Completion Rate:** The percentage of assessment tasks completed by the due date. (Goal: high on-time rate, demonstrating the reminder system works; low rate might indicate need for better nudges or more realistic deadlines).
- **Reduction in Redundant Requests:** This is more of an outcome metric – e.g., how often does a customer accept an existing profile or standard questionnaire instead of sending a new custom questionnaire. If the platform works, over time, the number of custom questionnaires should decrease as trust in the standardized profile grows. We could measure “# of times a standard artifact (like CAIQ or SOC2) was accepted in lieu of a custom assessment.”
- **Time Saved (Qualitative/Survey):** We might survey users to estimate how much less time they spend on vendor assessments after adopting the platform (e.g., product team targets a 50% reduction). This can be an important KPI for marketing ROI.

**Quality and Effectiveness Metrics:**

- **Issue Discovery Rate:** For customers, how many high-risk issues are discovered through assessments (e.g., % of vendors that get a “High Risk” rating). The goal isn’t to maximize this (we hope vendors are secure) but to ensure the process is rigorous enough to find problems. If this is near zero, maybe assessments are too lax; if very high, our user base might be onboarding risky vendors or not remediating them.
- **Remediation Tracking:** If we allow tracking of remediation tasks (outside scope for now), we could measure how many identified issues get addressed by vendors as a result of using the platform.
- **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT/NPS):** We will track user satisfaction via surveys or an in-app prompt. For instance, an NPS (Net Promoter Score) for the platform among customer risk teams and a separate one for vendor users. Positive trends in these scores indicate product-market fit and usability.
- **Support Tickets or Error Rates:** Internally, measure number of support inquiries or bugs reported. A decline in such issues over time indicates the platform is becoming more stable and intuitive. Also track uptime (aiming for 99.9%+ SLA) and performance (page load times, etc.), as these influence satisfaction.

**Platform Growth and Network Effects:**

- **Vendor-Customer Connection Count:** Number of unique vendor-customer relationships established on the platform. For example, Vendor A shared profile with 5 customers, that’s 5 connections. Platform value increases as this grows (like a network graph). We can monitor average number of connections per vendor and per customer.
- **Templates Utilization:** Frequency of use of each standard questionnaire template. E.g., how many CAIQs have been completed on the platform, how many SIGs. This identifies which frameworks are most in demand and if any are underutilized (maybe requiring education or might be unnecessary).
- **Integration Usage:** How many organizations have enabled key integrations (SSO enabled, Salesforce integration in use, etc.). This shows advanced adoption and can guide us if certain integrations are not used (maybe due to complexity – an area to improve).
- **Public Profile Accesses:** If trust centers are public, track how many views those get (for vendors who enabled it). A high number of public hits might correlate to shorter sales cycles (we can attempt to correlate metrics from vendor feedback).

**Targets and Benchmarks:** (To be refined in planning)
We will establish targets for these KPIs. For example:

- Achieve 100 vendor profiles in the first quarter post-launch, 500 by end of year.
- Reduce average assessment duration by 50% compared to manual process baseline within one year.
- Maintain an NPS of >30 from risk teams and vendors (indicating strong positive satisfaction).
- 80% of vendor tasks completed on time (up from, say, 50% baseline before reminders).
- Zero security breaches or data leak incidents (a security KPI).
- 99.9% uptime and <2s average page load time (service quality KPIs).

Regular tracking of these metrics will be done via an internal analytics dashboard. The product team will review them monthly and after major releases to ensure the platform is delivering value and to identify any user engagement issues early. These KPIs also help in communicating value to stakeholders (e.g., showing how many hours of work the platform saved or how risk visibility has improved due to its implementation).

## Implementation Phases

Building the platform will be a significant effort. We propose a phased implementation approach, delivering core value quickly and then iterating with additional features and improvements. Each phase has a focus, though some work streams may overlap.

### Phase 1: MVP (Core Platform Launch)

**Timeline:** (e.g., 6-8 months development)

**Goals:** Deliver a functional product that addresses the primary pain points – enable vendors to share a security profile and customers to review it – with essential workflow and security in place. Focus on the most commonly used features (the 80/20 rule) to begin generating value and feedback.

**Key Deliverables:**

- Vendor profile creation with basic sections (company info, a few custom fields, ability to upload documents).
- Support for 2-3 top standard questionnaires (e.g., CAIQ and a lightweight SIG or custom mini questionnaire) including the UI for vendors to fill them out and share responses.
- Basic assessment workflow: customers can find or invite a vendor, request the standard questionnaire or documents, and get notified when the vendor responds. Task tracking for one active assessment at a time.
- Profile sharing mechanism: vendor can share profile with a customer via email invite. NDA acceptance simple flow (maybe a generic NDA text or just a checkbox saying “I agree not to disclose” in MVP).
- Notifications: email notifications for key events (invite sent, questionnaire ready for review, etc.) and in-app notifications.
- Basic user management: user registration, login, password reset, simple roles (maybe just admin vs member roles in MVP). Likely include SSO integration for at least one IdP if required by initial clients (or plan for shortly after launch).
- Security foundations: ensure multi-tenancy isolation, encryption, audit logging in place from the start. Conduct a security review before launch.
- UI/UX: polished enough for beta use – likely a web app with the described layout. Maybe not every quality-of-life feature (e.g., maybe no drag-drop reorder of questions in MVP, etc.), but intuitive for the core flows. Provide user help for onboarding (could be simple FAQs or walkthrough documents if not fully in-app tour).
- Basic reporting: At least an admin dashboard for number of vendors, assessments. Not full reporting suite, but capture data so we can later expose it. Possibly a simple export of an assessment result to PDF for auditors.

**Out of Scope for MVP (saved for Phase 2+):** Advanced questionnaire library (support all templates), complex custom questionnaire builder, extensive integrations, advanced analytics, etc., unless a particular early adopter demands one of these specifically.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features and Integrations

**Timeline:** (Next 6+ months after MVP, iterative releases)

**Goals:** Build on MVP with a richer feature set to cover more use cases and improve user experience. Incorporate feedback from MVP users. Enhance automation and integration to increase stickiness.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Expanded Questionnaire Library:** Add full library of standard templates (SIG Core/Lite, NIST CSF mapping, GDPR checklist, ISO 27001 controls questionnaire, etc.) as ready-to-use options. Also introduce the **Custom Questionnaire Builder** so customers can create their own question sets on the platform.
- **Improved Workflow & Collaboration:** Multi-step approvals (e.g., require a second reviewer to sign-off on an assessment), ability for vendors to delegate questions internally, and a more robust comment discussion system within assessments.
- **Profile Sharing & Trust Center:** Launch the vendor public Trust Center pages with branding customizations. Allow vendors to have a public-facing page (with selected info) and integrate it to their website. Also implement fine-grained access control on documents (marking some as “available on request” with an automated request workflow).
- **Integrations Rollout:** Deliver key integrations such as:
  - Salesforce integration (embedding share action and maybe syncing status as described).
  - Slack/MS Teams notifications integration.
  - SSO integrations refined and expanded (cover most common providers, with admin UI for configuration).
  - Begin development on ServiceNow integration (could be in this phase or next, depending on demand – possibly deliver a connector or at least a documented method to sync data).
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Introduce a reporting module or at least more dashboards. e.g., a page for risk managers showing all vendors in a table with filters (essentially a reporting view with export). Possibly initial versions of metrics dashboards (time to complete, etc.) to demonstrate value.
- **Risk Scoring Engine:** Implement a basic risk scoring methodology for completed questionnaires to automate vendor ratings (e.g., an algorithm that flags answers that are concerning, and computes a score). This adds consistency for customers in how they judge responses.
- **UX Refinements:** Based on user feedback, improve UI components (maybe a wizard for vendor onboarding, better progress indicators, bulk actions like sending one request to many vendors if needed, etc.). Ensure the app is responsive for at least tablet use.
- **Scalability Enhancements:** If MVP usage has grown, optimize performance (maybe introduce caching or search service if needed for faster queries, ensure the system scales to hundreds of concurrent assessments smoothly).
- **Security Enhancements:** Possibly obtain SOC 2 certification by end of this phase (requires running the controls for several months). Also implement advanced security features like integration with a vulnerability scanner to run on uploaded docs (ensuring no malware distribution).

Phase 2 is about closing gaps and adding the most requested features from initial users, making the platform comprehensive for third-party risk workflows.

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities and Optimization

**Timeline:** (Beyond 12-18 months, ongoing product maturation)

**Goals:** Differentiate the product with advanced technology (e.g., AI assistance), optimize for larger scale deployments, and expand the ecosystem.

**Key Initiatives:**

- **AI Questionnaire Assistance:** Introduce AI/ML features such as an “Auto-Answer” capability that can draft answers to new questionnaires by analyzing the vendor’s existing profile (leveraging a large language model trained on security Q&A, for instance). Also, AI could help customers by highlighting potential risks in a vendor’s responses automatically.
- **Continuous Monitoring Integration:** Expand integration with external risk feeds – e.g., automatically pull in SecurityScorecard/BitSight ratings continuously, and alert if a vendor’s rating drops significantly. Integrate breach news feeds that notify if a vendor may have been involved in a security incident.
- **Mobile App or Mobile-Optimized Experience:** If there is demand (e.g., executives or sales wanting to view info on the go), create a mobile app or improve PWA (Progressive Web App) capabilities so that basic tasks (approvals, viewing a profile) can be done on a phone securely.
- **Internationalization and Localization:** Translate the UI into key languages (based on user base – e.g., offer in Spanish, French, German, Japanese) and handle localization of content (date formats, etc.) to expand global adoption.
- **Marketplace and Network Expansion:** Potentially create a more automated vendor network where vendors can opt-in to be discoverable by others. This might involve a public catalog of vendors (who choose to list themselves) that prospective customers can search and directly request access. Essentially, becoming a “marketplace” for vendor security profiles (similar to a trust exchange community).
- **Full GRC Integration & API Economy:** By this phase, provide a robust set of certified integrations (e.g., a certified ServiceNow app, Archer integration toolkit) and possibly partner with other risk management solutions. Offer a developer marketplace or support for partners to build on our API (maybe some clients want to integrate with procurement systems, etc., beyond what we provided).
- **Performance and Cost Optimization:** Refine the architecture for efficiency (perhaps multi-region deployments if we have global clients requiring data in specific geographies, active-active clustering for high availability, etc.). Ensure the platform remains responsive even with thousands of vendors and lengthy questionnaires (which might involve advanced optimizations, query tuning, etc.).
- **Compliance Accreditations:** Achieve any additional needed certifications (e.g., FedRAMP Moderate if pursuing US government clients, ISO 27701 for privacy, etc.). By this phase, the platform should be very enterprise-ready in terms of compliance pedigree.

Throughout Phase 3 and beyond, we will continuously iterate based on customer feedback and emerging industry trends. The product roadmap remains flexible to incorporate new regulations (for example, if a new standard questionnaire or law emerges, we’ll add support) and new technologies.

Each phase builds upon the previous, ensuring that we deliver incremental value while keeping technical risk manageable. Early phases prioritize core functionality and user adoption; later phases enhance depth, automation, and breadth of integrations, making the platform a leader in the vendor security assessment space.

These tend to be specialized and used only when relevant to the vendor’s services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Varies (PCI SAQ D ~300 questions; CMMC Level 3 ~130 practices to check).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

_Note:_ The platform provides these templates and may allow customization. Vendors fill them out once and reuse them for multiple clients, while clients benefit from industry-standard responses to reduce creating custom questionnaires.

### Appendix B: Sample Questionnaire Excerpts

Below are small excerpts illustrating the style of questions from a few standard questionnaires:

- **CAIQ (CSA)** – Format: Yes/No questions with additional context or reference to a control.

  - _Example Questions:_
    1. **“Do you have a formal information security policy endorsed by senior management?”** – (Expected answer: Yes/No, with optional comment. Aligns with CCM domain IS-01: Information Security Policy).
    2. **“Are multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms implemented for all remote access to your production cloud environment?”** – (Yes/No. CCM domain IAM – Identity & Access Management).
    3. **“Do you conduct regular vulnerability scanning and penetration tests on your cloud infrastructure?”** – (Yes/No and provide frequency, e.g., “Quarterly external scans and annual pentests.”)

- **SIG (Standardized Information Gathering)** – Format: Mix of yes/no and open-ended. Organized by domain.

  - _Domains (examples):_ Enterprise Security Policy, Asset Management, Access Control, Network Security, Application Security, Incident Management, Privacy, etc. ([What is the SIG Questionnaire? SIG Core & Lite Compliance Guide | UpGuard](https://www.upguard.com/blog/sig-questionnaire#:~:text=The%2019%20risk%20domains%20evaluated,by%20the%20SIG%20include)).
  - _Example Questions:_
    1. (Domain: Access Control) **“Does the organization enforce least privilege access for systems and data (i.e., users only have access to what they absolutely need)?”** – Yes/No, with explanation.
    2. (Domain: Incident Management) **“Has the organization documented an incident response plan and is it tested at least annually?”** – Options: Yes – tested annually; Yes – but not tested; No plan.
    3. (Domain: Business Continuity/Resilience) **“What is the maximum tolerable downtime for critical systems, and do you have disaster recovery capabilities to meet that RTO?”** – Open-ended (expects a time value and description of DR arrangements).

- **GDPR/Privacy Questionnaire** – Format: Typically yes/no or short answer focusing on compliance measures.

  - _Example Questions:_
    1. **“Is a Data Protection Officer (DPO) appointed (required if applicable under GDPR) and are their contact details made available?”** – Yes/No (and provide details if yes).
    2. **“Can you accommodate Data Subject Requests (access, deletion, correction) within the required timeframe (e.g., 30 days)?”** – Yes/No, with process description.
    3. **“List the countries where you store or process personal data. If outside the EU, what legal transfer mechanism is used (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses)?”** – Open-ended list.

- **ISO 27001 Controls Questionnaire** – Format: Yes/No if control is in place, often with request for evidence or policy name.
  - _Example Questions:_
    1. (A.9 Access Control) **“Do you have a user access management process that includes user provisioning, de-provisioning, and regular access reviews?”** – Yes/No, and maybe ask “When was last access review?”.
    2. (A.11 Physical Security) **“Are there physical access controls (badge, biometric, etc.) to secure areas housing critical systems?”** – Yes/No, describe controls.
    3. (A.12 Operations Security) **“Do you regularly back up important data and have you tested data restore procedures?”** – Yes/No, with frequency of backups and last test date.

These examples demonstrate the variety: some questionnaires are high-level (GDPR focuses on legal compliance), others are very granular technical checks (CAIQ, ISO). The platform’s goal is to make it easy for vendors to answer these clearly, and for customers to quickly find the answers they care about.

### Appendix C: Vendor Profile Example Structure

For reference, an outline of a typical vendor security profile that a vendor might maintain on the platform:
