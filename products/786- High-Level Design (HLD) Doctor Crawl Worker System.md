🏗️ High-Level Design (HLD): Doctor Crawl Worker System
🎯 Objective
To build a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant document crawling and processing system that:

Accepts crawl jobs

Crawls web pages

Processes crawled data

Stores structured information

Manages job state and failure handling

Supports document deletion based on flexible filters

🧱 System Components

1. Job Submission API (External/Assumed)
   Accepts crawl requests with URL, tags, job ID, and crawl limits.

Calls create_job() to queue the crawl task in Redis via RQ.

2. Redis Queue (RQ)
   Message queue to decouple job creation from execution.

Queues tasks like perform_crawl under a "worker" queue.

3. Worker Process (main.py)
   Bootstraps the worker and connects to Redis.

Initializes DuckDB and checks the document_embeddings table.

Uses rq.Worker to continuously pull and execute queued jobs
.

4. DuckDB Database
   Stores:

Job metadata (jobs table)

Processed pages (pages table)

Document embeddings (document_embeddings table)

Lightweight, embedded, analytics-oriented database.

5. Crawl and Processing Pipeline (perform_crawl)
   Updates job state to "running"

Executes:

crawl_url() to discover pages (async)

process_page_batch() to extract/store data

Tracks:

Discovered vs processed page count

Final status is set to "completed" or "failed"
.

6. Delete Operation (delete_docs)
   Supports deletion by:

Specific page IDs

Domain substring match

Tags (with JSON-based filtering)

Deletes relevant entries from the pages table
.

🔁 Workflow Overview
Job Creation

Client submits job → create_job() saves to DuckDB → queues job on Redis.

Worker Execution

main.py worker fetches job from Redis → calls perform_crawl.

Crawling & Processing

Pages crawled → Processed → Data persisted → Job status updated.

Document Deletion

Task deletes documents based on tags, domains, or specific IDs.

🧰 Tech Stack
Layer Tech Used
Queue Redis + RQ
Crawler crawl_url (async)
DB DuckDB (embedded)
Task Worker Python RQ Worker
Logging Custom logger

🧠 Design Considerations
Async crawling ensures scalable I/O-bound work.

DuckDB enables local analytics without complex DB infrastructure.

RQ simplifies task distribution and retry logic.

Robust job status tracking supports observability and recovery.

Extensible task model: easily add more tasks like summarization or indexing.

📈 Future Enhancements
Add Web UI to track jobs and view results.

Support multiple queues for priority management.

Add persistent job retry logic.

Store metadata in PostgreSQL for scale.

Integrate with LLMs for semantic enrichment.

Here is an updated High-Level Design (HLD) for your Doctor Project, now including all newly uploaded components:

🏗️ High-Level Design (HLD): Doctor - Document Crawler, Indexer, and Search System
🎯 Purpose
The system enables:

Web crawling for structured document acquisition.

Processing and embedding of page content.

Vector indexing and semantic search using DuckDB VSS.

Job tracking and deletion capabilities.

🧱 Core Components

1. Job Submission API
   Uses Pydantic models (FetchUrlRequest, FetchUrlResponse) for request/response schema
   .

Triggers create_job() which:

Stores metadata in DuckDB.

Queues crawl job via Redis RQ.

2. Worker (main.py)
   Connects to Redis.

Boots rq.Worker listening on the "worker" queue.

Initializes DuckDB and validates schema/table presence
.

3. Database: DuckDB
   Stores:

Job metadata (jobs)

Raw page content (pages)

Embeddings (document_embeddings)

Enabled with VSS (Vector Similarity Search) using HNSW indexes
.

4. Task Queue: Redis + RQ
   Manages task execution asynchronously:

perform_crawl for crawling and processing

delete_docs for document removal

5. Crawling and Processing Pipeline (processor.py)
   Workflow per page:

Extracts text → splits into chunks → embeds each → stores in DuckDB
.

Embedding:

Uses generate_embedding() to create OpenAI-compatible 1536-dimension vectors.

Indexing:

Uses VectorIndexer to store vectors with payloads
.

6. Vector Search Engine (indexer.py)
   Embeds chunks and enables:

Insert (index_vector, index_batch)

Search (search) with optional tag filters
.

7. Configuration (config.py)
   Centralized env-based config for:

Redis, DuckDB, OpenAI API, chunk size, etc.

8. Models (models.py)
   Strongly-typed interfaces for API endpoints:

Job progress

Search results

Document list and details

9. Logging (logger.py)
   Central logging config across components
   .

3. Embedder (embedder.py)
   Calls OpenAI-compatible embeddings via LiteLLM (litellm.aembedding) for each text chunk
   .

4. Vector Indexer (indexer.py)

Raw page text into the pages table

Crawl job metadata into the jobs table

Updates job progress/status during lifecycle
.

6. Processing Pipeline (processor.py)

Crawl → Extract → Store → Chunk → Embed → Index

Supports concurrency for embedding generation
.

7. Control Layer
   tasks.py: Manages job creation, performs crawling, and deletes docs
   .

main.py: Boots RQ worker with Redis + DuckDB + scheduler support
.

8. Configuration & Logging
   config.py: Centralized constants (Redis URI, OpenAI keys, DB paths, chunk size)
   .

logger.py: Standardized logging setup
.
