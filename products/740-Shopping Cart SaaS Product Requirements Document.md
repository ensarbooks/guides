# Shopping Cart SaaS Product Requirements Document

## Introduction

**Purpose:** This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the full specifications for a cloud-based **Shopping Cart Software as a Service (SaaS)** platform. The document details all essential functional requirements of the shopping cart system (what the product must do) and the non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.), along with UI/UX designs, system architecture, user use cases, analytics needs, future roadmap, and appendices. The purpose of this PRD is to provide product managers, developers, and stakeholders with a comprehensive technical blueprint of the Shopping Cart product to ensure a common understanding and guide the development process.

**Scope:** The scope of this document covers the core shopping cart capabilities for an e-commerce platform. It includes features that allow customers (end-users) to select products, review their cart, and complete purchases, as well as administrative and backend features needed to support these processes (inventory updates, payment processing integration, shipping calculations, etc.). The system is intended to be offered as a multi-tenant SaaS solution that can be integrated into various e-commerce websites. This PRD does **not** cover unrelated e-commerce functions such as product content management or warehouse management beyond their direct interaction with the cart. Out-of-scope features (for now) include on-site content management/CMS, advanced customer relationship management (CRM) beyond cart analytics, or an in-house payment gateway (third-party payment integrations will be used instead).

**Audience:** The document is written for a technical audience – primarily product managers, software architects, and senior developers involved in building or maintaining the shopping cart SaaS. It assumes familiarity with web application concepts and e-commerce terminology. Non-technical stakeholders (like business or marketing teams) may refer to the high-level summaries, but the PRD’s level of detail is aimed at guiding implementation.

**Product Overview:** The Shopping Cart SaaS platform (working name "ShopCartPro") enables e-commerce websites to easily incorporate robust cart and checkout functionality. Websites integrate with ShopCartPro via front-end components or APIs to provide end-users with a seamless shopping experience from adding products to checking out. ShopCartPro will manage cart state, interact with inventory systems to ensure stock accuracy, handle discount logic, compute taxes and shipping, process payments securely, and provide merchants with tools to track cart performance (e.g., abandonment rates). The solution is designed with a microservices architecture for scalability and reliability, and emphasizes security (compliant with standards like **GDPR** for data privacy and **PCI DSS** for payment data security).

This PRD is organized into sections covering:

* **Functional Requirements** – what features and behaviors the shopping cart must support.
* **Non-Functional Requirements** – quality attributes like performance, security, and scalability.
* **UI/UX** – wireframes and design considerations for the cart interface, checkout flow, and notification emails.
* **System Architecture** – the proposed microservices design, data storage, APIs, and integration points with third-party services.
* **Use Cases and User Stories** – representative scenarios and user stories that the system must handle, with accompanying use case diagrams for key interactions.
* **Analytics and Reporting** – requirements for tracking usage metrics and providing reporting dashboards to merchants.
* **Future Enhancements** – possible future features and versioning considerations to keep the product roadmap scalable.
* **Appendices** – supplementary information including a glossary of terms, reference documents, and compliance checklists.

## Functional Requirements

The Shopping Cart SaaS platform must fulfill a set of core **functional requirements** to deliver expected e-commerce capabilities. These requirements describe what the system should do - each is critical to enabling a smooth shopping experience for end-users and efficient management for merchants. Below is a breakdown of the key functional features:

### 1. Cart Item Management (Add/Remove/Edit Items)

* **Add Item to Cart:** Users (shoppers) must be able to add products to their shopping cart from the product listing or product detail pages. The system shall create a cart session for new users (or use the existing cart for returning users) and record the selected item and quantity. If the item is already in the cart, adding it again should increase its quantity (or optionally notify the user).
* **Remove Item from Cart:** Users must be able to remove an item from their cart at any time before purchase. Removing an item will update the cart’s item list and recalculates the cart totals (e.g., subtotal, tax, shipping).
* **Edit Item Quantity:** Users must be able to change the quantity of any item in the cart. Increasing or decreasing the quantity should trigger an update to the item’s line total and overall cart total in real-time. If quantity is set to zero, it is equivalent to removing the item.
* **Cart Persistence:** The cart contents should persist for a user across page navigations and sessions. For guest users, the cart may rely on browser cookies or local storage plus a server-side session. For logged-in users, the cart should be tied to the user’s account (so they can, for example, log in from another device and see the same cart). Cart data should remain available for a configurable duration (e.g., 30 days for guests) to support “returning later” scenarios.
* **Empty Cart State:** The UI should handle the case of an empty cart (e.g., show a friendly message like “Your cart is empty” and perhaps recommend products or prompt the user to continue shopping).

### 2. Product Details Display in Cart

* **Item Details:** For each item in the cart, the system shall display key product information including the product name, a thumbnail image, selected options (such as size or color if applicable), unit price, and quantity selected.
* **Price Calculation:** The cart must show the price for each line item (unit price \* quantity) and a running subtotal for all items. Any discounts applied to individual items should be reflected here (e.g., if an item is on sale or a coupon applies to a specific item).
* **Stock Availability Indicator:** The cart interface should indicate if any item’s availability has changed. For example, if an item in the cart goes out of stock or falls below the requested quantity, the system should display a warning or adjust the quantity with a message. This requires real-time validation with the inventory system (see Inventory integration below).
* **Product Attributes:** If products have variants or options (size, color, etc.), those selected attributes should be visible in the cart. The user should be confident they have the correct variant in their cart without needing to navigate back to the product page.
* **Updates on Change:** Whenever the user modifies the cart (adds/removes items or changes quantities), the product detail display and totals should update immediately (AJAX updates on web, or dynamic updates in a single-page app) to reflect the current state.

### 3. Real-Time Inventory Integration

* **Inventory Checks on Add:** When a user attempts to add an item to the cart, the system must verify with the inventory service that the item is in stock (and in the desired quantity). If stock is insufficient or the product is no longer available, the add-to-cart action should be prevented and an informative message shown (e.g., “This item is out of stock”).
* **Inventory Reservation (Optional):** To prevent overselling, the system may reserve inventory for items in active carts. This could be a soft reservation (inventory is decremented only on checkout, but a hold is noted) or a hard reservation (decrement stock when added to cart, release if not purchased in X minutes). The approach depends on business rules. For now, we assume stock is decremented only upon completed checkout, to avoid complications; however, the system should flag if multiple concurrent customers have the same last item in cart at checkout time.
* **Real-Time Stock Updates:** If inventory levels change (due to purchases by others or stock adjustments by admin) while a user’s cart is active, the system should ideally update the user’s cart to reflect that. For example, if the user has 3 units of an item in cart but only 2 remain in stock, a notification should inform them of the change when they view the cart or attempt to checkout.
* **Inventory Service API:** The cart will integrate with an external Inventory Management System via API. Each time an item’s availability needs verification or update, a request is sent (e.g., “GET /inventory/{productId}” to fetch current stock, or a bulk check for all items in cart at checkout). The integration must be efficient to handle high traffic, possibly batching requests for multiple items. Inventory updates (stock decrement) should occur immediately after an order is confirmed to avoid race conditions.

### 4. Secure Checkout and Payment Processing

* **Checkout Process:** Users can proceed to checkout from the cart. The checkout process will typically collect shipping information, billing information, and payment details. The system shall guide the user through these steps in a logical flow (see UI/UX section for wireframes of the flow).
* **Multiple Payment Methods:** The platform must support multiple payment options to cater to various user preferences. At minimum, this includes credit/debit card payments (via a payment gateway), and alternate methods like PayPal. It should be designed to easily add new payment methods (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay, or other regional gateways) as needed.
* **Payment Gateway Integration:** Instead of processing payments directly, the system will integrate with certified payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, Braintree, PayPal SDK). The checkout front-end will collect payment details (ensuring sensitive data entry fields are secure) and send them to the gateway. The backend should never store raw card numbers (to maintain PCI compliance; see Security section). Tokenization techniques from gateways should be used: e.g., receive a one-time token representing the card, which is then used to charge the payment.
* **Order Review and Confirmation:** Before finalizing payment, the system should present an order summary (items, shipping cost, taxes, total amount) for user review. The user confirms and the payment is processed. If the payment is authorized successfully, an order is created in the system. In case of payment failure, the user should receive a clear error and an opportunity to retry or use a different method.
* **Secure Data Handling:** All pages in the checkout flow must be served over HTTPS. Any payment data should be transmitted securely and **not logged** or exposed in any way. The system will utilize the gateway’s secure forms or hosted fields if possible (to reduce PCI scope). Additionally, the platform should support 3D Secure or other authentication flows required by certain regions for card payments (e.g., PSD2 SCA in Europe).

### 5. Order Confirmation Emails

* **Email Trigger on Order Placed:** When an order is successfully placed (i.e., payment is confirmed and order record created), the system shall automatically send an order confirmation email to the customer. This email serves as a receipt and summary of the purchase.
* **Email Contents:** The confirmation email will include order details such as: order number, date/time, billing summary (item list with quantities and prices), subtotal, taxes, shipping fee, total paid, shipping address, billing address, chosen shipping method, and an estimated delivery date or next steps for delivery (if available). It should also include contact information for customer support and possibly links to view the order status online.
* **Merchant Notification (Optional):** Optionally, the system might also send an email notification to the merchant or store admin for each new order, or integrate with their order management system. (This could be configurable per merchant.)
* **Email Template Customization:** The platform should allow the SaaS client (merchant) to customize the branding of these emails – including adding their logo, adjusting the template colors, and customizing certain text (like a thank-you note or footer). This may be achieved via a templating system or simple admin settings (covered in UI/UX).
* **Sending Mechanism:** Emails should be sent via a reliable email service (e.g., AWS SES, SendGrid, etc.) to ensure deliverability. The system should queue email sending as a background task so it doesn’t delay the checkout response to the user.

### 6. Cart Abandonment Notifications (Reminders)

* **Detection of Abandoned Carts:** The system shall have a mechanism to detect cart abandonment. If a user adds items to their cart and proceeds partway through checkout but does not complete the purchase within a defined time window (e.g., 1 hour or 24 hours), that cart is considered “abandoned.” Abandonment can be identified for logged-in users reliably (since their identity is known), and for guest users if they provided an email in checkout or if cookies allow tracking.
* **Reminder Emails/Notifications:** For identified abandoned carts, the system will send an automated reminder email to the user, gently prompting them to complete their purchase. This email typically includes the list of items left in the cart and perhaps an incentive (like a discount code) to encourage completion. The tone should be friendly (e.g., “You left some items in your cart. Complete your purchase before they sell out!”).
* **Timing and Frequency:** The timing of the reminder can be configured (e.g., first reminder after 1 hour, a second reminder after 24 hours if still not purchased). The PRD requires at least one reminder email. (In future enhancements, this can be expanded to multiple or to push notifications/SMS if applicable).
* **Opt-Out and Compliance:** The system must ensure that these emails are sent in compliance with user consent and communication preferences (tie in with GDPR and CAN-SPAM compliance). If the user has opted out of marketing emails, we may still send transactional reminders if allowed, but it’s best to have clear consent for “abandoned cart emails” as part of signup or checkout.
* **Customization:** Like order emails, the content and branding of cart reminder emails should be customizable per merchant. Also, include in the email a clear call-to-action link that brings the user back to their cart (login-free resume of cart if possible).

### 7. Tax Calculation and Discounts/Promotions

* **Automated Tax Calculation:** The cart must calculate applicable taxes for the order based on the customer’s shipping address (or in some cases billing address, depending on jurisdiction) and the merchant’s tax rules. The system should integrate with a tax calculation service or use configurable tax rules for different regions. For example, in the US, sales tax may depend on state and city; in the EU, VAT depends on country and possibly product type. The requirement is to have a flexible tax module that produces a tax amount for the cart at checkout in real-time.
* **Tax Exemptions:** The system should support marking certain products or customers as tax-exempt (for instance, digital goods or wholesale customers). It should also handle edge cases like tax rounding differences.
* **Shipping Fee Calculation:** During checkout, once the user provides a shipping address, the system should present shipping options (standard, expedited, etc.) and their costs. These costs can be determined via integration with shipping carriers’ APIs (see next section) or via pre-configured tables (e.g., flat rate, free shipping over certain amount, etc., configurable by merchant). The chosen shipping cost will be added to the order total.
* **Discounts and Promotion Codes:** The cart must allow entry of discount codes (promo codes/coupons). Users can input a code (e.g., “SPRINGSALE”) and the system will validate it against active promotions. If valid, the corresponding discount is applied – this could be a percentage off the total (e.g., 10% off), a fixed amount off (e.g., \$20 off), or a specific deal (e.g., free shipping, buy one get one). The cart total and relevant line items should reflect the discount immediately.
* **Multiple Discounts:** The system should define rules for whether multiple promotions can stack or if only one can be applied. In MVP, we might allow one promo code at a time. The PRD should note that future versions may allow stacking or automatic best-discount selection.
* **Gift Cards/Credit:** (If in scope) The cart should also handle gift card redemption or store credit application. This is similar to a discount but might be treated as a form of payment. For now, we assume basic promo codes only; gift card handling can be a future enhancement.
* **Display of Savings:** The UI should clearly display any tax, shipping, and discount on the cart review and checkout pages. For instance: Subtotal, then “Discount: -\$X”, “Tax: \$Y”, “Shipping: \$Z”, and a grand Total.

### 8. Shipping Integration and Calculation

* **Real-Time Shipping Rates:** The system will integrate with shipping provider APIs (e.g., FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, etc.) to fetch shipping rate estimates for a given package. Based on the items in the cart (their weight, dimensions, and the shipping destination), the system should request available shipping methods and costs from carriers. These are then presented to the user to choose from at checkout. (For digital goods or services, shipping is not applicable, so the system should gracefully skip this step.)
* **Carrier Selection:** Merchants should be able to configure which carriers and services they want to offer (e.g., enable USPS Priority Mail and UPS Ground). The system will only fetch rates from those enabled services.
* **Label and Tracking Integration (Post-Order):** While the core cart doesn’t necessarily print labels, the order data should be compatible with shipping fulfillment systems. (E.g., after order placement, the system could send order info to a fulfillment service or at least store the chosen shipping method for the merchant to act upon.)
* **Shipping Rules:** The platform should accommodate custom shipping rules set by the merchant, such as free shipping thresholds (e.g., free standard shipping for orders over \$100) or flat-rate shipping options. These rules need to be configurable in the merchant admin settings and reflected in the checkout calculations.
* **Address Validation:** Optionally, integrate an address validation service to catch errors in shipping addresses at entry time, reducing failed deliveries. (This is a nice-to-have feature for later versions; not mandatory in MVP, but noted here.)
* **International Shipping Considerations:** The system should support international addresses and show/hide shipping options accordingly (e.g., don’t show domestic-only carriers for international addresses, handle customs info if necessary). However, detailed customs and duties calculations are out-of-scope for now (could be a future enhancement or handled by the merchant offline).

### 9. Analytics and KPI Tracking

* **Cart Abandonment Tracking:** The system must track when carts are abandoned. This means recording the event when a user leaves the site or fails to complete checkout after initiating it. For each cart, we should capture data like: items in the cart, user (if known), and at what step it was abandoned. This data feeds into analytics to compute the **cart abandonment rate** (percentage of carts not converted to orders).
* **Conversion Rate:** Track how many cart sessions convert into completed orders (the inverse of abandonment rate). Also track funnel drop-off at each stage (e.g., what percentage of carts proceed from cart page to entering checkout info, from info to payment, etc.).
* **Other KPIs:** The system should log other key events: when items are added (for “add-to-cart” analytics), removed, when checkouts are initiated, and completed. This allows calculation of metrics such as **average order value** (mean total of completed orders), **time to checkout** (average time from cart creation to order), etc.
* **Analytics Storage:** These events and metrics should be stored in a way that the reporting system can query. Likely, each cart and order in the database has timestamps and status that can be aggregated. Possibly a separate analytics module or simply well-structured database records that a reporting engine can use.
* **Dashboard Reporting:** There will be an admin dashboard (detailed in the Analytics section of this doc) where merchants can view these KPIs in real-time or via periodic reports. So the functional requirement is that the cart system provides the necessary data and maybe basic calculations to power such a dashboard.
* **No Performance Impact:** The tracking of analytics events should not slow down the user experience. Use asynchronous logging or event queues to record metrics without impacting the responsiveness of the cart and checkout. For example, when a user adds to cart, we fire an event to an analytics service in the background.

The above functional requirements ensure that the shopping cart covers all basic and advanced behaviors expected in a modern e-commerce scenario. Each requirement is considered critical. In development, they can be mapped to specific user stories and acceptance criteria to verify completion.

## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes and operational considerations for the Shopping Cart SaaS. These are just as crucial as functional features, as they ensure the system is performant, secure, and reliable. The key non-functional areas are:

### Performance and Scalability

* **Response Time:** The cart and checkout operations should be fast and responsive. Page loads (or API responses for cart operations) should typically occur in under 2 seconds for most user interactions, even under load. Adding an item to cart, updating quantities, and proceeding through checkout should feel instantaneous or with minimal delay to the user.
* **Throughput:** The system must handle a high volume of users especially during peak shopping periods (e.g., holiday sales). The architecture (see System Architecture section) uses scalable microservices to support spikes in traffic. For example, the cart service should support thousands of concurrent carts being updated per second without degradation. The checkout service should handle a high volume of simultaneous payment transactions by scaling out horizontally.
* **Scalability:** The SaaS solution should scale both **vertically** (more resources per server) and **horizontally** (more server instances) to accommodate growing load. As new merchants (tenants) join the platform, the system should be able to isolate and handle their traffic. Cloud-native deployment (containers, orchestration) is expected so that instances of services can automatically scale out. Using a microservices architecture inherently supports scaling specific bottleneck services (e.g., if the inventory check service is heavily used, we can scale that independently).
* **Capacity Planning:** The system should be tested to handle at least e.g. 10,000 simultaneous users (across all tenant stores) adding items and 1,000 simultaneous checkouts, as an initial benchmark. It should also handle large catalogs (e.g., carts with 100+ items, though typical carts have few items) and big promotions (flash sales). There should be no hard-coded limits (like number of items in cart, etc., aside from practical browser or memory limits).
* **Caching:** To improve performance, use caching where appropriate. For instance, product info and prices displayed in the cart can be cached on the front-end or edge, and inventory status could be cached for short intervals (a few seconds) to reduce repeated calls – as long as caches are invalidated properly on stock changes. Similarly, static content (like images, JS, CSS for UI) will be CDN-hosted. Ensure that the dynamic nature of cart data remains real-time (don’t cache the actual user cart state on the server beyond the user session context).

### Reliability and Availability

* **Uptime:** The Shopping Cart service should target high availability (for example, 99.9% uptime or better). This means minimal downtime in a given year. Since it’s SaaS serving potentially many e-commerce sites, any downtime can impact many businesses. The architecture should be designed for fault tolerance (use of redundant instances across different availability zones/data centers).
* **Failover and Redundancy:** There must be no single point of failure. Redundant servers for each microservice, replication for databases, and possibly active-active deployments across data centers should be in place. If one server or component fails, another should seamlessly take over. For example, if one instance of the Cart API crashes, a load balancer should reroute traffic to another instance automatically.
* **Data Durability:** User cart data and order data must be stored reliably. If a server crashes mid-checkout, the system should ideally allow the user to recover (e.g., their cart is not lost). Use transactional operations for critical sections (like order payment and creation) to avoid partial failures. Database systems should use replication and backups. Regular backups of databases (with order records, etc.) are required, and possibly point-in-time recovery for transactional data.
* **Consistency:** In a distributed system, we must balance consistency vs availability. For the cart, it’s acceptable to use eventual consistency in some cases (like inventory updates might propagate with slight delay) but critical operations like payment should be strongly consistent. If using microservices with eventual consistency (through events), ensure the user still gets a consistent experience (e.g., don’t confirm an order to user until all critical steps succeed).
* **Monitoring and Alerts:** The system should have monitoring in place (APM tools, log aggregation) to track uptime and performance. If any service goes down or if error rates exceed thresholds, on-call engineers should be alerted. This ensures quick response to any downtime, maintaining high availability.

### Security

Security is paramount for an e-commerce cart system due to handling of personal and payment data. The platform must enforce multiple layers of security:

* **Data Encryption (Transit & At Rest):** All communications must use HTTPS/TLS to encrypt data in transit, especially during checkout when sensitive data (addresses, payment info) are transmitted. For data at rest, any sensitive customer information stored in databases (e.g., passwords, if any user accounts; or payment tokens) should be encrypted or hashed. We will not store raw credit card numbers to minimize risk. If any temporary storage of payment data is needed, it must be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms (AES-256, etc.) and keys must be securely managed.
* **PCI DSS Compliance:** Since the system deals with payment processing, it must adhere to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. This includes measures like never storing full card numbers or CVV, using tokenization, maintaining secure network firewalls, regular security testing, and restricting access to cardholder data. The application should use the payment gateways in a way that most PCI requirements are offloaded to them (for example, using iFrame or redirect for card input so that our servers never see the raw card data). If any card data does touch our system, we ensure full compliance with the 12 PCI DSS requirements (firewalls, encryption, access controls, monitoring, etc.).
* **GDPR Compliance:** The platform must comply with data privacy regulations like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) for any users in applicable regions. This means obtaining user consent for storing cookies or personal data (like emails for cart reminders), allowing users to request deletion of their personal data, and ensuring data is only used for the purposes agreed. For example, the system should allow a user to request their account and associated data (cart history, etc.) be deleted, and we must comply within a reasonable time. Personal data stored (names, addresses, emails) must be protected and not shared without consent. Privacy policy and terms should clearly outline data usage.
* **Access Control:** Within the platform, ensure proper access control. Shoppers should only access their own cart and order data – strong multi-tenant isolation so one client’s data can’t be seen by another. Admin interfaces should require authentication. API keys or tokens used by front-end to call APIs should be scoped per merchant and user session.
* **Protection Against OWASP Top 10:** The system should be implemented following security best practices to mitigate common web vulnerabilities. For instance:

  * Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent **SQL Injection** or **XSS** attacks (user input in cart, coupon codes, etc., should be treated carefully).
  * Use proper authentication and session management to prevent **Session Hijacking**. Possibly implement HTTP-only, secure cookies for session, and consider CSRF tokens for any state-changing operations.
  * Protect against **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** by escaping outputs in the UI templates.
  * Rate limit APIs where necessary to prevent abuse (like someone attempting brute-force coupon codes or performing denial-of-service by adding to cart repeatedly).
  * Regularly update libraries and dependencies to fix known vulnerabilities.
* **Audit Logging:** Security-relevant events should be logged. For example, log administrative access, changes in configuration, or many failed payment attempts (which could indicate fraud). These logs should be protected and retained for analysis in case of incidents.
* **Penetration Testing:** Prior to release and regularly thereafter, the platform should undergo security audits and penetration tests to discover and fix any vulnerabilities.

### Compliance and Legal

* **GDPR and Privacy:** (As mentioned above) ensure the product has features to support user data rights. For instance, if the platform stores customer profiles, allow extraction or deletion on request. Also, ensure that the usage of cookies for cart persistence has consent banners if deployed in EU regions. Data retention policies should be defined – e.g., how long do we store abandoned cart data if the user never purchases? We might anonymize or delete personal data from abandoned carts after some period.
* **Accessibility:** While not explicitly stated in functional requirements, it’s a non-functional expectation that the UI will be reasonably accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance ideally). This means using semantic HTML in the cart and checkout pages, ARIA labels where needed, and ensuring keyboard navigability. Many regions have laws (e.g., ADA in the US) requiring web accessibility, which our product should strive to meet out of the box.
* **Localization and Currency:** The SaaS should support multiple currencies and localized formats. If merchants operate in different countries, the cart should display currency according to the merchant’s setting or user’s locale. Also, text in emails and UI might need translation. This PRD assumes initial launch in English and a primary currency, but the architecture should not hard-code assumptions that prevent future localization.
* **Disaster Recovery:** The company should have a disaster recovery plan. This includes regular backups (non-functional requirement: nightly backups of databases, with off-site storage) and tested restore procedures. In case of a major outage or data loss event, we must be able to recover the system (with minimal data loss, e.g., perhaps at most last few minutes of transactions). This goes hand-in-hand with reliability but is a separate planned process.

### Maintainability and Supportability

* **Modular Codebase:** The system’s microservices should be modular, with clean APIs, making it easier for developers to update one component without affecting others. Clear documentation (internal for developers, and API docs for integration) is required so that future teams can maintain the system.
* **Logging and Debugging:** Adequate logging at different levels (info, warning, error) in each service will aid in troubleshooting issues. For example, if an inventory check fails, log the product and error returned. Avoid logging sensitive info (to remain compliant). Implement correlation IDs across services to trace a single user’s session through the microservices (especially useful in a distributed architecture).
* **Monitoring:** As part of operations, the system should expose health endpoints for each service (for Kubernetes liveness/readiness checks) and metrics (possibly integrate with monitoring systems like Prometheus). This helps operations engineers keep the system healthy and spot issues before they escalate.
* **Backward Compatibility:** Over time, as APIs evolve (e.g., if we provide a JS SDK or API endpoints for merchants to integrate), ensure versioning is used so that updates don’t break existing integrations. This is more of an API design principle but important for maintainability – e.g., /api/v1/cart vs /api/v2 in the future, with deprecation strategies.

### Availability

*(Note: Availability is largely covered under Reliability above, but to emphasize…)*

* The system should ideally be available 24/7. Deployments of updates should be done in a rolling manner so as not to require downtime. Use load balancers to shift traffic during deployments (blue-green deployment strategy can be considered).
* In the case of planned maintenance (e.g., database upgrades), schedule them in off-peak hours and inform client merchants in advance, if any expected downtime (though aim for none).
* **Graceful Degradation:** If certain microservices or integrations are down (e.g., inventory service or an external shipping API is not responding), the system should handle it gracefully (maybe allow the cart to function in a limited way or queue the request) rather than crashing completely. For instance, if real-time shipping rates cannot be fetched, perhaps default to a predefined shipping fee or inform the user to try again, but don’t lose the whole cart session.

In summary, these non-functional requirements ensure that beyond just **what** the shopping cart does, it does it in a way that is fast, dependable, secure, and compliant with regulations – all of which is essential for a product that will serve as critical infrastructure for online businesses.

## UI/UX Design

The user interface and user experience of the shopping cart and checkout are critical for conversion. This section provides wireframes and design requirements for the main cart interface, the checkout process, and the email templates that the system generates. The design should be intuitive, mobile-responsive, and consistent with common e-commerce UX patterns to minimize user friction.

**Design Principles:** The cart and checkout UI should be clean and uncluttered, highlighting product information and key actions (such as the "Checkout" button). It should follow the look-and-feel of the merchant’s website (through branding customization options like logo and color scheme). Error messages (e.g., “item out of stock” or “invalid card”) should be clearly displayed and styled in a way that is noticeable but not jarring. All forms (address, payment) should be user-friendly with proper labels and validation messages. Additionally, the design must be responsive – working well on mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) as well as desktop, since a significant portion of shoppers use mobile.

### Cart Page Wireframe and Layout

&#x20;*Example wireframe of a shopping cart page on a mobile view. The cart page lists items (with thumbnails, names, selected options, quantity, and price), shows the total, and provides a call-to-action button to proceed to checkout.*

The **Shopping Cart page** is where users review items they have added:

* It should list each **cart item** on a separate row or card. Each entry includes the product image, product name, selected variant (e.g., color “Yellow”, size “M”), price per unit, quantity selection (likely a small input or dropdown), and the line total. A small "Remove" (×) icon or button should allow removing that item.
* If the item has options, those can be shown either under the name or as part of the name (as the wireframe above illustrates, showing “Yellow” color selected).
* Below the list of items, the **cart summary** is shown. This includes a subtotal of item prices. It may also pre-calculate an estimated tax and shipping if possible (or this might be deferred until the address is known at checkout). At minimum, it shows Subtotal and a Total (which might initially equal subtotal until other fees are known).
* Prominently display the **“Proceed to Checkout”** button (or text could be “Checkout” or “Continue to Shipping”). This button should stand out (using a highlight color). In the wireframe, it's a gray button indicating the next step. On a real design, it would be styled according to the site's theme (often a bright color).
* If applicable, below the checkout button, mention accepted payment methods or trust badges (to reassure users of security) – this is a common e-commerce pattern.
* The page should also allow users to continue shopping (perhaps a link “Continue Shopping” that returns to browsing, often placed near the cart items or as a back button icon).
* **Empty Cart State:** As noted, have a design for when the cart is empty – perhaps a friendly message and a link to start shopping.

*Mobile vs Desktop:* On desktop screens, the cart page can use a two-column layout (items on left, summary on right). On mobile (like the wireframe above), it stacks vertically: items on top, total and checkout button at bottom. Ensure the checkout button is not missed on mobile – possibly make the summary bar sticky at the bottom of the viewport.

### Checkout Process Wireframes

The checkout process typically spans multiple steps/pages (though a one-page checkout is possible, multi-step is more common for clarity). The main stages include:

1. Collect Shipping Address (and choose shipping method)
2. Collect Payment Information (and billing address if different)
3. Review & Confirmation

We aim for a streamlined two-step or three-step checkout for a balance of simplicity and data gathering.

&#x20;*Wireframe of a two-step mobile checkout: on the left, the “Checkout” page shows items and subtotal with a form for Shipping Information; on the right, the “Payment Methods” page allows selecting Credit Card or Apple Pay, entering card details (or using stored methods), applying a promo code, and finalizing the checkout.*

In the example above, it’s a mobile checkout flow:

* The **first screen** (“Checkout”) shows a list of items (like a mini cart summary for context) and collects Shipping Information. It has a progress indicator at top (showing how many steps). The user enters their name, address, etc., and taps **Continue**.
* The **second screen** (“Payment Methods”) then collects payment details. It shows options (Credit Card, Apple Pay etc.), a form for card info, and also a field for a promo code (with an apply button). It also reiterates the order summary (subtotal, shipping fee, total) so the user knows the amount to be charged. Finally, a **“Checkout”** or “Place Order” button completes the purchase.

For a desktop or web full-size version, these steps might be separate pages or sections:

* **Shipping Info Page:** contains form fields for Name, Address, Email, Phone (if needed), and Shipping Method choice. After filling these, user continues to Payment.
* **Payment Page:** fields for card number, expiry, CVV (unless using an external wallet like PayPal which would redirect). Also billing address (with a checkbox “Same as shipping” to simplify if true). Possibly option to save this info if user has an account.
* **Review Page:** optionally, a final page that displays all details read-only and a Confirm button. (If the Payment step already had “Place Order”, then that doubles as review confirmation.)

**Validation and Errors:** The UI must validate required fields (e.g., highlight if ZIP code is missing or card number is invalid). Errors should be clearly shown next to the field or in a summary at top. For card errors returned by gateway (like declined card), display them at the payment step without losing the user’s entered data.

**Design Consistency:** Each step should have the merchant’s branding (logo at top, maybe a header that says “Checkout” or the store name). Keep a consistent layout so users don’t feel disoriented between steps. A progress indicator or breadcrumb (like “Shipping → Payment → Review”) at the top helps users understand where they are in the process.

**Mobile Design Considerations:** On mobile, use autofill and mobile-optimized input types (e.g., numeric keypad for ZIP or card CVV) to reduce friction. The CTA buttons (Continue, Place Order) should be full width and easily tappable.

### Email Templates (Order Confirmation & Cart Reminder)

The system will send out transactional emails such as order confirmations and cart reminders. The design of these emails should be consistent with the merchant’s brand identity and provide clear information. Below is an example of an order confirmation email design:

&#x20;*Sample Order Confirmation email design (Polaroid Originals example). It thanks the customer, confirms the order details (items, prices, total), provides shipping information, and next steps. This is a simplified, responsive email layout that can adapt to mobile email clients.*

**Order Confirmation Email Design:**

* The email typically starts with the store’s logo and a headline, e.g., “Thank you for your order!” or a fun phrase (“We’re on it.” in the example).
* It addresses the customer by name (“Hey \[Name], this is a quick email to say we’ve received your order.”).
* Key sections in the email:

  * **Order Summary:** A list of items purchased, including product names, variants, quantity, and price each, and a total. Often formatted as a table for clarity (as shown in the example, two items with price, a discount line, subtotal, shipping, and total).
  * **Shipping Info:** Restate the shipping address the user provided and the shipping method chosen. Also, mention the expected delivery time or that another email will follow when it ships.
  * **Billing Info:** (If needed, e.g., payment method last4 of card or PayPal info, and billing address if different).
  * **Next Steps:** Inform the user what to expect: e.g., “You will receive a tracking email once your order ships. You can also visit our store to check your order status.”
  * **Support:** Encourage contacting support if any questions, and provide the support email or phone number.
* The design should be mobile-friendly (a single column layout, large enough text/buttons). Use the store’s colors for headings or buttons (like a “View your order” button that links to an order status page).
* Include footer with the store’s contact info, address, and links to policies (this also helps compliance with email regulations).

**Cart Abandonment Reminder Email Design:**

* Typically, this email will have a subject like “You left items in your cart” and in the body, show the items left behind, possibly with images.
* It should have a clear call-to-action: “Resume your order” which brings them back into the checkout with their cart intact.
* The tone is gentle and helpful. Possibly include an incentive (“Here’s a 10% off coupon if you checkout in the next 24 hours”) if such a campaign is in use.
* Design elements: the store logo, a message (“We noticed you left something behind...”), product images and names of cart items, and a big button to continue shopping. Optionally, show the cart total or a reminder of any promotion expiration.
* This email, like the order email, should be branded and responsive.

**Email Template Customization:** The platform should allow merchants to customize the content to a degree. Likely tokens will be used in a template (e.g., {{CustomerName}}, {{OrderID}}, {{ItemList}}). The layout can be standard, but merchants might upload a logo and set accent colors. Ensure the default templates are professional and tested across common email clients (Gmail, Outlook, mobile mail apps) for compatibility.

### Additional UI/UX Notes:

* **Feedback & Loading States:** The UI should give feedback when actions are processing. E.g., if user clicks “Place Order”, disable the button briefly and show a spinner or message “Processing...” to avoid double submissions.
* **Localization:** As mentioned in non-functional, the UI text should be translatable. Use generic labels (“Cart”, “Checkout”) which can be replaced by locale files for different languages.
* **Error pages:** In case something goes wrong (e.g., service outage preventing checkout), have user-friendly error messaging (“We’re experiencing an issue processing your order. Please try again later or contact support.”).

By adhering to these UI/UX guidelines and using the provided wireframes as a reference, the resulting application will be user-friendly, which is vital for maximizing conversion rates and user satisfaction.

## System Architecture

The Shopping Cart SaaS is designed with a **microservices architecture** for flexibility and scalability. This section describes the high-level architecture, including the main services, how data is stored, and how the system interfaces with external components (like payment gateways and shipping APIs). The goal is to ensure the system can handle heavy load, be developed and deployed in parts, and integrate smoothly with third-party services.

&#x20;*High-level architecture diagram of the Shopping Cart system (for illustration). The green block represents the checkout/front-end component, blue blocks are various microservices (Cart Service handling cart CRUD, Inventory Service for stock, Catalog for product info, Coupon service, etc.), and yellow blocks represent messaging queues for asynchronous processing. This shows how the frontend interacts with backend services and how those services communicate with each other to fulfill cart operations.*

*(Diagram explanation:)* The diagram above outlines a possible implementation where the **Checkout Panel (frontend)** calls the **Cart Service** for various actions (add product, remove product, etc.). The Cart Service in this example uses a message queue to coordinate with other services: an **Inventory Service** to check quantity, a **Catalog Service** to get product details and pricing, a **Coupon Service** to validate any coupons, and potentially others (Discount, Tax, Shipping rate services). While the specific implementation can vary, the key takeaway is separation of concerns: each service (cart, inventory, etc.) handles its domain and communicates through APIs or async events.

### Microservices and Components

The architecture is broken into several core services:

* **Cart Service:** Manages the shopping cart state – creates carts, adds/removes items, updates quantities. It contains the business logic for cart rules (e.g., cannot add more items than in stock, applying discounts to cart totals). It interfaces with Inventory and Product services to validate and fetch data, and with Order service at checkout.
* **Product Catalog Service:** Provides product details such as name, description, images, and base prices. When the cart needs to display an item or calculate price, it can query this service (though for performance, product info might also be cached or duplicated in the cart database).
* **Inventory Service:** Maintains stock levels for products. The Cart service queries it to ensure availability. On order completion, Inventory service will be decremented. Inventory might also push events (like “product X now out of stock”) to which Cart service could subscribe to update any affected active carts.
* **Pricing/Discount Service:** (Could be part of Cart or separate) Handles complex pricing rules, promotions, and coupons. For example, validating a coupon code, or calculating a volume discount. In a simple implementation, Cart service can do this itself, but a separate service allows more complex promo engine logic.
* **Tax Calculation Service:** Given an order (items + address), returns tax amounts. This could integrate with external tax API (like TaxJar or Avalara) or use internal rules.
* **Order Service:** Responsible for creating and managing orders. At checkout, the Cart service (or the Checkout service if separate) will call Order service to create a new order record in the database. The Order service finalizes the order after payment and orchestrates post-order actions (sending confirmation email, notifying fulfillment, etc.).
* **Payment Service:** For handling payment transactions. Often, we won’t have a full payment processing engine inside our system, but this service acts as an integration layer with external gateways. It might store payment method tokens, handle webhooks from gateways (for events like payment confirmation), etc.
* **User Account Service:** (If the platform supports user accounts) handles user authentication, storing addresses, etc. Not strictly part of the cart, but checkout will interface with user data if the user is logged in.
* **Notification/Email Service:** To send emails (order confirmation, cart reminder). Could be an internal microservice that sends emails via an SMTP or email API, triggered by events from Order or Cart (like “cart abandoned” event).

All these services communicate primarily via **RESTful APIs** (synchronous calls). In some cases, asynchronous messaging (using a message queue or pub/sub) is employed for decoupling – e.g., after an order is placed, an “Order Placed” event can be published for other services (Inventory, Email) to react.

Each microservice has its own database (this is a microservice best-practice to ensure loose coupling). For example, the Cart service might use a fast in-memory DB or NoSQL to store active carts, the Product service might use a relational DB for product catalog, and Order service a relational DB for orders.

Key points about the microservices:

* They are independently deployable and scalable. If the **Shopping Cart service** becomes a bottleneck, we can scale it out separately from, say, the Tax service.
* They communicate over network calls – so API design (contract) between them must be well-defined (see APIs below).
* Using microservices also means we need an **API Gateway** or routing mechanism for external clients (the e-commerce frontends) to call the right service. In this SaaS, likely there will be a unified API endpoint for the e-commerce site to talk to (to not expose dozens of separate service URLs). The gateway can route “/cart/\*” calls to Cart Service, “/checkout/payment” to Payment Service, etc.

### Data Storage and Database Design

* **Cart Data:** Carts are often transient but can be stored. A recommended approach is using a fast key-value store (like Redis) or a document database for cart contents, keyed by a cart ID or user ID. This allows quick reads/writes as the user updates their cart. Cart items could also be stored in a SQL DB, but performance at scale and cleaning up old carts must be considered. Possibly use Redis for active carts (with an expiry), and move to a persistent store once order placed (orders will be in SQL).
* **Order Data:** Orders are critical records (for merchant and legal purposes). Use a durable relational database for orders, order items, payments, etc. Schemas would include tables like Orders, OrderItems, Payments, Shipments. Ensure referential integrity and the ability to query order history.
* **Product & Inventory Data:** If our SaaS manages these, they might be stored in their own services. Alternatively, many merchants will have their own product database and just feed data to the cart. But to be safe, our system might cache product info. Inventory counts, if stored by our system, should be transactional and perhaps in the Inventory service’s DB.
* **Session Data:** If needed, tracking user sessions (for logged in state) can be done via token (JWT) so that we avoid server-side session storage. But cart sessions (for guests) may be stored with a session ID cookie.
* **Scaling Databases:** Use replication and partitioning as needed. For example, orders can be partitioned by merchant or date if needed. Also, consider using a read-replica for heavy analytical queries so as not to impact live transactions.
* **Backups:** Implement regular backups for all critical databases (especially orders). Also, backup any NoSQL store that holds carts, though loss of an active cart database is not as severe as orders (but still bad for user experience).

### APIs and Integration Interfaces

The platform exposes APIs both for the front-end (the e-commerce website or application that uses the cart) and for internal service communication:

* **Frontend API (Public):** This could be a REST API or GraphQL that the merchant’s website calls. Example endpoints:

  * `POST /cart` – create a new cart (or returns existing cart for user).
  * `POST /cart/items` – add an item (with product ID and quantity in the request body).
  * `PUT /cart/items/{itemId}` – update quantity or other attributes of an item in the cart.
  * `DELETE /cart/items/{itemId}` – remove an item.
  * `GET /cart` – retrieve current cart state (list items, totals).
  * `POST /cart/apply-coupon` – apply a discount code.
  * `GET /shipping/rates?cartId=...&postalCode=...` – get shipping options.
  * `POST /checkout` – submit order (with all required info in body: cartId, shipping address, payment token, etc.), which then triggers the process of payment and order creation.
    These are just examples; the actual design might combine some (for instance, checkout could be a single endpoint that encompasses apply-coupon and shipping selection).
* The API should handle authentication/authorization. Likely each API call includes a token that ties it to a specific merchant and user session.
* **Internal Service APIs:** e.g., Cart Service may have `GET /internal/cart/{id}` for Order service to use, etc. These might not be exposed publicly.
* **Webhooks:** The system might provide webhooks to merchants for certain events (e.g., order completed webhook, so the merchant’s backend can be notified and update their systems). We should allow merchants to register URLs for such events.
* **Third-Party Integration APIs:**

  * *Payment Gateway:* The Payment Service will call out to gateways via their APIs (could be REST or using SDKs). For example, Stripe’s API for charge creation or PayPal’s SDK for order creation.
  * *Shipping Carriers:* Use their APIs to get rates and maybe to create shipments. Likely just rate query during checkout.
  * *Tax API:* If using a service (like Avalara), the Tax service will call that external API with order details to get tax.
  * *Email/SMS API:* The Notification service may use something like SendGrid API to send emails, or Twilio for SMS if implemented.

**API Gateway & Routing:** We might implement an API Gateway that all external requests go through. This gateway will handle things like:

* Merchant-specific subdomain (e.g., the SaaS could give each client a subdomain or an API key to include, and route accordingly to isolate data).
* Rate limiting and security checks at the edge.
* Routing to correct microservice (by URL path or request data).
* Aggregation (if we present a unified checkout endpoint, the gateway might internally call multiple services, though often the Checkout service itself would handle orchestrating calls to others).
* The gateway can also simplify client integration, as merchants only worry about one base URL.

**Documentation:** All public APIs should be documented (OpenAPI spec / Swagger, etc.) so that integration is clear for developers on the merchant side if needed.

### Third-Party Integrations (Detailed)

The Shopping Cart SaaS relies on several external systems to provide full functionality:

* **Payment Gateways:** As noted, we integrate with providers like Stripe, PayPal, etc. Integration approach:

  * Use client-side tokenization (e.g., Stripe Elements or PayPal Checkout) so that the front-end directly interacts with the gateway for sensitive info. The backend then receives a token and simply authorizes the payment with that token.
  * The Payment Service stores minimal info like transaction IDs, and updates order status based on gateway response.
  * If the gateway requires server-side calls (some do for executing a transaction), ensure API keys are securely stored and used.
  * PCI Compliance is aided by mostly delegating to these gateways.
* **Shipping Providers:** Integration might be through APIs like USPS Web Tools, UPS/FedEx APIs which often require XML/JSON requests with weight & dimensions to get rates. The Shipping (or Checkout) service will call these. We must store API credentials for each merchant (since rates or accounts might differ). For MVP, maybe use generic rates or a service like EasyPost which consolidates carriers.
* **Tax Calculation Service:** Could integrate with a service via API. For example, Avalara’s Avatax: we’d send a request of order lines + address, and get tax amounts per line and total tax. Alternatively, for simplicity, allow merchants to set tax rates manually in settings.
* **GeoIP / Address services:** Possibly use an API to auto-fill city/state from postal code, or to validate addresses (like USPS address validation).
* **Analytics Integration:** Some merchants might use Google Analytics or other tracking. Our system should be able to emit events that can be consumed by front-end for Google Analytics (like e-commerce tracking for add-to-cart, purchase completed). Ensure our design doesn’t block that; likely this is handled on the front-end integration side but worth noting.
* **Logging/Monitoring Services:** We may integrate with services for error tracking (e.g., Sentry for front-end errors, DataDog for infrastructure metrics) to maintain the platform’s health.

### Deployment and Infrastructure

Though not the main focus of a PRD, it’s worth noting the envisaged deployment:

* Each microservice runs in a container (Docker), orchestrated by Kubernetes or similar. This allows easy scaling and isolation.
* Use of cloud managed databases (for reliability), and managed cache stores.
* The API gateway could be an ingress controller or a dedicated gateway service.
* Static assets (the embedded cart UI script, if any, and images like product pictures) would be served via CDN for speed.
* The front-end that merchants use could either be custom (some merchants will use our JS SDK to embed a cart widget) or a reference UI that calls our API.

The architecture is thus flexible: if a merchant wants to only use our backend via API and build their own UI, they can (since we have well-defined APIs). Or they can use our provided UI components that already interface with this backend.

By using a robust architecture, the system ensures isolation of services, easier maintenance (updates to one service don’t require deploying the whole system), and high scalability – all necessary for a SaaS product that may serve many clients with varying loads.

## Use Cases and User Stories

To ensure the system meets user needs, we describe representative use cases and user stories for different user types interacting with the shopping cart. **User Stories** are short narratives from the perspective of an end-user or admin, and **Use Cases** detail the sequences of interactions to achieve specific goals. Together, these clarify requirements in context.

### User Roles

* **Shopper (End User):** This is the customer visiting the e-commerce site, who uses the shopping cart to compile a purchase and checkout.
* **Merchant (Store Admin):** The owner or manager of the online store using our SaaS. They configure settings (like tax rules, shipping options, email templates) and view analytics. They also receive orders in their admin interface or via their order management system.
* **System Admin/Support:** (For completeness) Our SaaS internal admin role – manages tenants, monitors the system. Not a focus of this PRD but mentioned for context.

### User Stories (Shopper)

* **Story 1: Add to Cart** – “As a shopper, I want to add a product to my shopping cart, so that I can purchase it after I finish browsing.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* The item appears in my cart with correct name, price, and quantity. I receive feedback that it was added (cart icon update or message). If the item was already in cart, its quantity is incremented.
* **Story 2: Edit Cart** – “As a shopper, I want to change the quantity of an item in my cart or remove it, so that my cart reflects what I intend to buy.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* Changing quantity updates the price total immediately. Removing an item makes it disappear from the cart and updates subtotal. The system handles edge cases (can’t exceed available stock, can’t go below 1 without removing).
* **Story 3: View Cart Summary** – “As a shopper, I want to review all items in my cart with their details and totals, so that I can verify my order before checking out.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* The cart page shows each item’s name, variant, price, quantity, and a subtotal. It shows the overall subtotal, any taxes/shipping (if known), and the total amount. I can easily navigate to checkout from here.
* **Story 4: Apply Coupon** – “As a shopper, I want to enter a promo code for a discount, so that I can reduce the price if I have a valid coupon.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* The system allows code entry. If code is valid, the discount is applied (total updated, and maybe a line “Discount -\$X” is shown). If invalid/expired, I get a clear error message.
* **Story 5: Checkout (Happy Path)** – “As a shopper, I want to smoothly complete the checkout by providing shipping and payment info, so that I can place my order successfully.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* I can fill in my shipping address. I can select a shipping method and see the cost. I provide payment details and confirm. The system processes and then shows me an order confirmation (on-site and via email). After submission, my cart is empty (order has been converted).
* **Story 6: Checkout (Out-of-stock Scenario)** – “As a shopper, if an item in my cart became unavailable by the time I checkout, I want the system to inform me and help me resolve it, so that I know what to do.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* During checkout, if stock is insufficient, I’m notified that item X is out of stock or quantity reduced. The checkout will not proceed with that item until I adjust (e.g., remove it or accept new quantity). I shouldn’t be charged for an item not available.
* **Story 7: Abandon Cart and Return** – “As a returning shopper, I want the items I left in my cart previously to still be there when I come back, so that I don’t have to find them again.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* If I added items and didn’t buy, and I return within a reasonable time (say a few days), the cart still contains those items. (If I was logged in, always; if guest, via cookie). If items are out of stock by then, it should indicate so.
* **Story 8: Receive Cart Reminder** – “As a shopper who left the site, I want to get a reminder email about my cart, so that I’m encouraged to complete my purchase.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* An email is sent after X time with a friendly reminder listing my items and a link. When I click the link, it brings me back and my cart is restored ready for checkout.
* **Story 9: Order Confirmation** – “As a shopper, I want to receive an order confirmation email after I place an order, so I have a record of it and know the next steps.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* Email arrives shortly after purchase. It contains correct details (items, total, addresses) and a confirmation number. It’s well-formatted and provides contact info if I have an issue.

### User Stories (Merchant/Admin)

* **Story A1: Configure Settings** – “As a merchant, I want to configure my store settings (tax rates, shipping options, payment keys), so that the cart calculates and behaves correctly for my business.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* In a merchant admin UI (or config file), the merchant can set tax behavior (e.g., use automatic or set a flat rate, etc.), define shipping methods (like enabled carriers or flat fees), and input API keys for payment gateways and others. These settings are saved and applied to the customer-facing cart.
* **Story A2: Customize Emails** – “As a merchant, I want to customize the logo and style of emails sent to customers, so that the communication feels branded from my store.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* Merchant can upload a logo, set primary color, and maybe edit the text of templates within allowed placeholders. A test email can be previewed. Customers then receive emails with those customizations.
* **Story A3: View Cart/Checkout Analytics** – “As a merchant, I want to see metrics like how many carts are abandoned or conversion rate, so that I can gauge my store’s performance and identify issues.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* On a dashboard page, the merchant sees stats (# of carts created, # converted to orders, abandonment % over time, average order value, etc.). They can filter by date range. Data is presented in charts and key numbers. This data matches what actual usage is (i.e., it’s accurate as per system events).
* **Story A4: Handle an Order** – “As a merchant, I want to receive the order details once a customer places an order, so that I can fulfill the order (ship items to the customer).”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* When an order is placed, I can view it in my Order Management interface (either provided by the SaaS or via an API that feeds into my own system). The order has all needed info: items, customer shipping address, chosen shipping method, and payment confirmation. I can then process it (this PRD doesn’t cover the actual processing steps).
* **Story A5: Set up Products (if needed)** – “As a merchant, I want to ensure my products are available to the cart system, so that customers can add them.”
  *Acceptance Criteria:* Depending on integration mode: If our SaaS is fed via API from the merchant’s catalog, this might mean the merchant ensures product feed is synced. If our system has a product admin, the merchant adds products with price, stock, etc. Once products are there, customers can add them to cart.

*(These merchant stories highlight that the SaaS must support configuration and reporting tools, which would be detailed in an admin UI document. For the scope of this PRD, we focus on the cart behavior itself and mention admin needs for completeness.)*

### Use Case Scenarios

Below are a couple of detailed use case flows to illustrate how the system behaves in specific situations:

**Use Case: Guest User Checkout (Happy Path)**
**Actor:** Shopper (not logged in)
**Precondition:** Shopper has selected items on the site and wants to purchase; items are in stock.
**Main Success Scenario:**

1. Shopper goes to the Cart page (perhaps by clicking a cart icon). The system displays the current cart contents.
2. Shopper clicks “Proceed to Checkout”.
3. The system presents the checkout form (Step 1: Shipping). Shopper enters shipping address and email.
4. Shopper chooses a shipping method from the options retrieved (system calculated shipping cost).
5. Shopper clicks Continue. The system validates the inputs and saves them to the temporary order data.
6. The system presents Payment form (Step 2). Shopper selects “Credit Card” and enters card details (or selects PayPal option which redirects and back, etc.).
7. Shopper applies a promo code (optional). System validates code and updates order total to reflect discount.
8. Shopper clicks “Place Order”.
9. System contacts Payment Gateway to authorize charge for the total amount.
10. Payment Gateway responds **success**.
11. System creates an Order record in the database with status “Paid/Pending Fulfillment” and all details. Assigns an order number.
12. System displays an Order Confirmation page to Shopper (“Thank you, your order #12345 has been placed”).
13. System triggers confirmation email to be sent to the Shopper’s email.
14. Postcondition: The cart is now empty/archived, the order is stored for merchant to fulfill, inventory is decremented, and shopper has confirmation.

**Use Case: Cart Abandonment and Recovery**
**Actors:** Shopper, System (for email)
**Precondition:** Shopper has added at least one item to cart and gone to checkout page, but not completed order. Shopper provided an email in the process (or was logged in, so we know email).
**Main Flow:**

1. Shopper goes to checkout page, inputs email but then leaves (closes browser or navigates away) before completing payment.
2. System’s background job flags the cart as “abandoned” after a timeout (say 1 hour of inactivity).
3. After a configured delay (e.g., 24 hours), system generates an abandoned cart email to the shopper’s email address captured.
4. Shopper receives the email with subject “You left items in your cart”. The email lists the items and has a “Resume Checkout” button.
5. Shopper clicks the link.
6. The system identifies the cart (via a unique token in the link, likely tied to the cart ID and shopper) and restores it on the site. Shopper lands on a special page or the cart page with their items still there.
7. Shopper continues to checkout and places the order successfully this time.
8. Postcondition: If the shopper still does nothing, perhaps a second reminder could be sent later (depending on configured strategy), or the cart eventually expires (maybe in weeks). The merchant can view metrics of this abandonment.

These use cases highlight how different components interact: e.g., the abandonment flow uses the email notification subsystem, the checkout uses Payment and Order subsystems.

*(A use case diagram would show the Shopper actor connected to use cases like “Add to Cart”, “Checkout”, “Apply Coupon”, etc., and perhaps an Admin actor for “Configure Store” and “View Reports”.)*

Overall, by analyzing these user stories and use cases, we ensure that the functional requirements earlier indeed enable these real-world scenarios. Each story should trace to one or more functional requirements (and non-functional considerations too, like performance during checkout). This user-centric view validates that the system will satisfy user needs when implemented.

## Analytics and Reporting

An essential part of a shopping cart platform is providing the merchant with insights into how users are interacting with the cart and how the store is performing. This section details the requirements for analytics data collection and the reporting dashboards that present this data.

### Key Metrics to Track

The system should automatically collect data to compute the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics:

* **Cart Abandonment Rate:** The percentage of shopping carts created that do not result in a completed order. (This is a crucial metric – a high abandonment rate might indicate UX problems or other issues.)
* **Conversion Rate:** The percentage of cart sessions that convert into purchases. Often the inverse of abandonment: e.g., if 100 carts were started and 30 orders completed, conversion is 30%.
* **Number of Abandoned Carts:** In absolute terms, how many carts were abandoned in a given period.
* **Number of Completed Orders:** How many orders were placed (which can be cross-referenced with total cart starts to derive conversion).
* **Average Order Value (AOV):** The average monetary value of completed orders. Calculated as total revenue / number of orders in a period.
* **Item Addition/Removal Stats:** How many times items are added to cart, and removed. Perhaps which items are most frequently abandoned.
* **Time to Purchase:** The average duration from cart creation to order placement (for those that complete). And perhaps average time before abandonment.
* **Bounce at Checkout Steps:** Drop-off rates at each step of checkout (how many start checkout vs how many finish entering shipping vs how many finish payment).
* **Payment Failures:** Count of failed payment attempts (could hint at issues with payment gateway or fraud attempts).
* **Top Products in Cart:** Which products are most commonly in carts (this might be more of a nice-to-have analytic for marketing).
* **Geographical data:** If possible, where are users ordering from (based on shipping address countries, etc.).

The system already logs events necessary for these (as described in Functional Requirements and Use Cases). It must aggregate and store these in a way suited for reporting. Likely a separate analytic database or data warehouse might be used for complex queries, but for now we assume we can compute daily/weekly aggregates.

### Dashboard Reporting Features

Merchants should have access to an **Analytics Dashboard** in their admin interface. This dashboard will visually display the KPIs and allow some interaction (filtering by date range, etc.).

&#x20;*Wireframe example of an e-commerce analytics dashboard. It includes a sidebar for navigation, top summary figures (Total Sales, Visitors, Orders, etc.), charts (Revenue vs Orders over time), and other metrics like Sales by category, Conversion Rate, etc. In our context, the focus would be on cart-related metrics.*

The dashboard for our Shopping Cart SaaS might include:

* **Summary Cards:** At the top, show big numbers like:

  * *Total Sales* (in the last X days) – total revenue from orders processed through the cart.
  * *Conversion Rate* – perhaps shown as a percentage with an up/down trend compared to previous period.
  * *Total Orders* – number of orders in period.
  * *Abandoned Carts* – number of abandoned carts in period.
* **Charts:**

  * A line or bar chart showing **Revenue vs Orders over time** (as in the wireframe) – perhaps plot daily sales revenue and number of orders for each day in the selected range.
  * A pie or bar chart for **Abandonment vs Conversion** or “Sales by category” if we breakdown by product categories (though category info depends on product data).
  * A funnel chart could illustrate the checkout funnel: e.g., 1000 carts → 400 started checkout (entered address) → 300 entered payment info → 250 completed order. This visualizes where drop-offs happen.
* **Conversion Rate and Abandonment:** These could also be explicitly visualized. E.g., “Conversion Rate: 5.65% (▲ 1.0% week over week)” as in the wireframe’s text. And “Add to cart -> Checkout initiated -> Completed purchase” counts listed to see percentages at each stage.
* **Top Products in Abandoned Carts:** possibly a table of products that were most often left in abandoned state. (This can help merchant adjust pricing or promotions for those items.)
* **Date Filtering:** The dashboard should allow merchant to select a date range (today, last 7 days, last 30 days, custom). All metrics update accordingly. Internally, our system needs to be able to query data by date (we should timestamp events).
* **Multi-store (if applicable):** If a merchant has multiple storefronts or the SaaS operator is viewing all merchants, filters to scope the data might be present. But likely each merchant only sees their data.

The design should follow standard dashboard usability: use visual cues (green up arrows for improvement, red down arrows for decline in metrics, etc.), and be performance-optimized (pre-compute aggregates if needed to load quickly).

### Reports and Exports

* The system should support exporting order or cart data for offline analysis. For instance, an “Export CSV” of all abandoned carts with user emails and items (for a period) so merchant can do targeted marketing outside the system if needed.
* Possibly scheduled email reports: e.g., a weekly summary email to the merchant with key stats. (This can be a future enhancement but worth mentioning if merchants request it.)
* Provide an API for analytics (maybe future): So merchants can pull raw data into their BI tools if the dashboard is not sufficient. Not a requirement for MVP, but keep data structured in a way that this is feasible.

### Implementation Considerations for Analytics

* We will create a logging mechanism for events (Add to cart, Remove, Checkout started, Order placed). Each event record could include: timestamp, cart ID, user (if known), product IDs involved, and event type.
* A separate process or service can consume these events and update summary tables (or simply at query time, compute).
* For real-time dashboard updates, computing on the fly might be okay for moderate data, but as data grows, consider nightly jobs to compute metrics or using a time-series database.
* Data retention: Analytics data could be stored indefinitely for historical reporting. But raw detailed logs might be trimmed after some time if not needed (we might keep aggregate daily numbers for long term).

By fulfilling these analytics requirements, the platform not only helps merchants understand their business but also provides us (the SaaS provider) valuable feedback on where users struggle (via funnel metrics), enabling continuous UX improvements.

## Future Enhancements

While this PRD covers the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and immediate next-phase requirements, we also outline potential future enhancements. These are not committed features for the initial release, but the system should be designed with these in mind to ensure **scalability** and **extensibility**.

* **Multi-currency and Localization:** Expand the platform to natively support multiple currencies (with real-time exchange rates) and multiple languages for all user-facing text. This would allow merchants to use the cart for international stores and display prices in the shopper’s local currency. It implies enhancements in pricing (maybe separate price lists per currency) and formatting (e.g., comma vs period as decimal in prices, translating “Checkout” button text, etc.).
* **Saved Carts/Wishlists:** Allow authenticated users to save carts or move items to a wishlist for later. This can improve retention (not losing items of interest). Technically, this means linking cart to user accounts and maybe having multiple named carts or a wishlist entity.
* **Social Commerce Features:** Integration with social platforms – e.g., share cart or share wishlist via a link, or chat plugins that remind users of their cart via Facebook Messenger, etc. Not a core cart requirement, but an add-on that could increase conversion.
* **One-Click Checkout / Stored Payment Methods:** For returning customers, allow them to save a payment method (securely via token) and next time do a one-click purchase (especially useful in mobile apps). This introduces user accounts and vaulting of cards (which requires even stricter compliance handling or delegating to gateway vaults).
* **Headless Commerce API Extensions:** Provide more extensive GraphQL or REST API for headless commerce scenarios, where merchants use completely custom frontends (web or mobile apps) and only call our backend. Ensure our API covers all needed operations (which likely it will, but we might extend documentation, SDKs, etc.).
* **AI-driven Recommendations:** Although outside the immediate cart function, in the future the platform might offer “customers also bought” suggestions on the cart page to increase upsells. This would involve integrating with a recommendations engine using purchase data.
* **Dynamic Pricing and A/B Testing:** The ability to test different cart UI or flows for merchants (A/B testing features) and to support dynamic pricing (e.g., personalized discounts). This is advanced and would require collecting data and altering behavior for segments of users.
* **Mobile App SDK:** Develop a mobile SDK for iOS/Android that apps can integrate to use the cart system. We already have APIs, but a native library could simplify using our cart in native mobile apps, handling things like local cart caching and synchronization.
* **POS Integration:** If merchants have physical stores, integrate cart with point-of-sale systems for unified inventory and order management. For example, an order started online could be completed in-store or vice versa.
* **Scalability Enhancements:** As usage grows, further optimize the architecture:

  * Implement distributed caching or use of CDN for some API calls if possible.
  * Partition databases by tenant to isolate very large clients.
  * Introduce auto-scaling rules that are more granular.
  * Consider micro-frontends for the UI components, so updates can be deployed without affecting all clients at once.
* **Machine Learning for Fraud Detection:** Implement basic fraud scoring for orders (this can augment payment gateway checks). For instance, flag orders that have mismatched billing/shipping or very high value with many failed attempts.
* **Expanded Reporting:** More sophisticated analytics like customer lifetime value (if connecting multiple orders to a user), cohort analysis, and integration with Google Analytics e-commerce tracking out-of-the-box.

Each enhancement would come with its own detailed requirements document when we decide to implement. However, mentioning them helps to guide current design decisions:

* For example, multi-currency means avoid assuming a single currency in code or DB (store currency as a field with prices).
* One-click checkout means design the data model now to possibly store payment tokens linked to user accounts (even if not used until later).
* Additional services (recommendation, fraud) means keeping architecture open to adding new microservices without big refactoring.

### Versioning and Roadmap

We foresee versioned releases of the API:

* **v1.0** – MVP features as described in this PRD.
* **v1.1** – Possibly includes some quick wins like improvements to UI/UX (based on initial feedback) and minor features (maybe wishlist or minor analytics enhancements).
* **v2.0** – A larger update perhaps introducing user accounts and saved payments, multi-currency, etc., which might not be backward compatible (hence a major version bump). We’ll maintain v1 for a period for clients who can’t migrate immediately.

The product should maintain backward compatibility within a major version. For instance, new fields might be added to APIs but not remove existing ones in 1.x.

By planning these future improvements, we ensure the current architecture is robust enough to extend. We avoid tight-coupling that would hinder adding, say, a new microservice, or supporting a new frontend form factor.

This forward-looking approach will keep our Shopping Cart SaaS competitive and capable of serving growing and evolving e-commerce needs over time.

## Appendices

### Glossary

* **SaaS (Software as a Service):** A software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. In this context, our Shopping Cart platform is a SaaS product used by many e-commerce websites.
* **Shopping Cart:** On e-commerce sites, a feature that allows users to accumulate a list of items for purchase, analogous to placing products in a physical shopping cart in a store. It holds items until the user checks out or abandons them.
* **Checkout:** The process of providing necessary information (shipping, billing, payment) and confirming a purchase for the items in the cart.
* **Conversion Rate:** The percentage of visitors or carts that result in a completed purchase (order). High conversion implies the site effectively turns interested users into buyers.
* **Cart Abandonment:** When a user adds items to the cart but leaves without completing the purchase. Abandonment rate is a key metric to minimize.
* **PCI DSS:** Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, a set of security standards designed to ensure that ALL companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.
* **GDPR:** General Data Protection Regulation, a European Union law on data protection and privacy. Requires businesses to protect personal data and privacy of EU citizens, and gives individuals rights over their data (consent, erasure, etc.).
* **Microservices:** An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services which communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service is responsible for a specific piece of functionality.
* **API:** Application Programming Interface, a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. Here, it allows different services to communicate and external clients (like the front-end) to use the system’s functionality.
* **Tokenization (Payment):** The process of substituting a sensitive data element (like a credit card number) with a non-sensitive equivalent (a token) which has no extrinsic meaning or value. Used to enhance payment security.
* **A/B Testing:** A method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.
* **Order Management System (OMS):** Software that helps manage orders from creation to fulfillment. Our SaaS outputs orders that either our own simple OMS or external systems will handle.
* **Headless Commerce:** An e-commerce system where the front-end (head) is separated from back-end services. It allows using our back-end cart with any custom front-end via APIs.
* **SPA (Single Page Application):** A type of web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content as the user interacts, often used for smoother, app-like experiences (common in modern cart/checkout implementations).

### Reference Documents

* **API Specifications:** (To be prepared) Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints provided by the Shopping Cart SaaS.
* **User Interface Design Doc:** Detailed design guidelines and style guide (fonts, colors, spacing) for the cart and checkout pages.
* **Payment Gateway Manuals:** Integration guides for each supported gateway (e.g., Stripe API docs, PayPal integration guide) to ensure our implementation meets their requirements.
* **Security Compliance Standards:** PCI DSS 4.0 official documentation, GDPR full text reference, any regional laws if expanding (like CCPA for California).
* **UML Diagrams:** Additional UML diagrams (class diagrams for data model, sequence diagrams for checkout flow) may be available to developers for a deeper technical view (these complement the use case narratives provided here).
* **Testing Plan:** A separate document listing test cases for each requirement, especially for critical flows like checkout (ensuring every step’s validation works, emails send, etc.).
* **Performance Benchmark Report:** (Future) Document showing results of load testing the system (e.g., can handle X req/sec, etc.), to validate performance NFRs.

### Regulatory Compliance Checklist

The following checklist summarizes key compliance requirements and whether they have been addressed in this PRD/design:

* [x] **PCI DSS Compliance:** No cardholder data stored on our servers; all payment processing via secure tokens or third-party. TLS encryption enforced. Yearly compliance audit to be scheduled.
* [x] **GDPR Compliance:** Mechanisms for user consent on data (e.g., cookie usage for cart, opt-in for marketing emails), ability to delete personal data (either via merchant admin or support request). Privacy policy will be provided to merchants to include on their sites explaining use of our cart service.
* [x] **CAN-SPAM / Email Compliance:** Transactional emails (order confirmation, etc.) are allowed without unsubscribe, but marketing-oriented ones like cart reminders should include an unsubscribe link or respect a global opt-out. System will include opt-out handling for cart reminders.
* [x] **Accessibility (WCAG):** Cart and checkout pages use proper HTML semantics, labels, and contrasts. We will do an accessibility audit. Any images (like product thumbnails) have alt text, etc. Ensuring tab order flows correctly for keyboard navigation.
* [x] **Data Retention Policy:** Define that abandoned cart data (with personal info) will be purged after N days, order data perhaps retained indefinitely or as per merchant contract. Logs containing personal data have limited retention.
* [x] **Cookies and Session Security:** If cookies are used, a Secure flag is set, and for EU users a consent banner (outside scope of cart but something merchants need to handle – however we should provide info on what cookies our system uses).
* [x] **Backup and Recovery:** Automated backups in place for databases daily, with tested restoration procedures.
* [x] **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** (For info) We plan to offer an SLA to merchants (uptime 99.9%). Monitoring and failover strategies in architecture support this.

All these items should be reviewed before launch. The checklist ensures that beyond just building features, we are launching a robust, compliant service.
