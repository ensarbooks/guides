# Recruitment Platform PRD

**Document Purpose:** This Product Requirements Document outlines a comprehensive recruitment platform tailored for product manager-led staffing operations. It details twenty core features that collectively enable seamless hiring and management of temporary, project-based, and permanent staff. The platform is envisioned to connect **Partners** (business clients needing staff) with **Pros** (workers seeking opportunities) in an efficient, reliable manner. Features span from rapid candidate matching and vetting (e.g., background checks, quizzes, references) to robust management tools (like dashboards, tracking, and communication). The PRD ensures each feature is described with its value proposition, functional design, user experience, and integration with other features. The target audience includes **product managers, design leads, and engineering leads** who will collaborate to implement these features, as well as stakeholders from operations and product leadership who require a high-level understanding of the system.

## 1. Fast Connection to Workers

### Executive Summary

**Fast Connection to Workers** is the platform’s ability to fill job requests with qualified Pros **quickly – often within minutes** of posting. When a Partner posts a staffing request (for an immediate shift or upcoming opening), the system rapidly notifies a pool of eligible Pros and confirms one (or many, as needed) to the role. Our intelligent matching engine considers location, skills, and availability to target the right Pros who can accept the job promptly. The goal is to minimize the time Partners spend waiting to secure labor – achieving near-instant staffing for urgent needs. This feature underpins the platform’s on-demand value proposition, making hiring as easy as pressing a button and getting a worker.

### Business Goals & Value Propositions

- **Minimize Time-to-Fill:** Dramatically reduce how long it takes to fill a shift vacancy compared to traditional agencies. Ideally, requests are filled in **< 30 minutes**, even for same-day needs. This responsiveness prevents business disruptions (e.g., a restaurant avoids being short-staffed for tonight’s dinner service by finding a replacement server in minutes).
- **Operational Continuity:** By filling roles fast, Partners maintain normal operations and revenue. The platform becomes a reliable “safety net” for last-minute call-outs or demand spikes – they know they can get someone on short notice, so they feel secure taking on business or handling unexpected staff shortages.
- **Competitive Differentiation:** Speed is a key market differentiator. If our platform consistently provides a worker faster than competitors (or internal solutions), Partners will prefer us. It fosters a reputation that “you can count on \[Platform] when you’re in a pinch.”
- **Partner Convenience:** Reducing wait times also reduces Partner effort – they post a job and _almost immediately_ get a confirmation of a worker. There’s no need for multiple calls or long email threads to find coverage. This convenience encourages them to use the platform for more and more staffing needs (even non-urgent ones, because it’s simply easier).
- **Pro Engagement:** Fast matching benefits Pros too – those looking for work get offers quickly on their app. Idle time is reduced, and they can plan their day knowing sooner that they’ve got a gig. It creates a dynamic, real-time marketplace where Pros are habitually checking the app for immediate opportunities.
- **Scalability:** Building the systems and processes for rapid fulfillment means the platform can handle large volumes of requests efficiently (automation vs. manual agency dispatch). As we grow, the same fast-response mechanism scales to many requests without proportional increase in staff – driving operational leverage.

### Functional Requirements

- **Real-Time Job Broadcast:**

  - When a Partner submits a job posting (especially if it starts within the next few hours), the system should automatically and immediately broadcast that opportunity to a set of available, qualified Pros.
  - Notifications (push notification, SMS, and/or email depending on Pro’s preference) are sent to those Pros’ devices containing key details (role, time, location, pay).
  - Use geolocation filter – notify Pros within a reasonable radius (e.g., 20 miles or specific commute time) to ensure response and arrival speed.
  - Possibly stagger the broadcast: e.g., first notify a smaller pool of best-matching Pros (those with high ratings or who’ve worked with that Partner before) for a few minutes; if none accept, then widen to the broader pool. This optimizes quality and fills while still being quick.

- **One-Tap Acceptance:**

  - Pros receive an actionable alert: e.g., “New Shift – Tomorrow 8am-4pm at Acme Corp, \$X/hr. Tap to Accept.”
  - On tapping, the app should quickly confirm if they got the slot (“You’re confirmed for Tomorrow 8am!”) or if someone else already took it (if almost simultaneous acceptances – handle via a first-come-first-serve transaction on the server).
  - The UX should be streamlined – perhaps showing a brief summary and an **“Accept”** button, and maybe a **“Decline”** or ignore option.
  - If accepted, immediately notify the Partner (and remove the posting from the open pool).

- **Instant Confirmation to Partner:**

  - As soon as a Pro accepts, the Partner should get a notification and see on their dashboard that the position is filled – showing the assigned Pro’s name and profile.
  - Speed here is critical: ideally the Partner sees a status update **within seconds** of posting that a worker is confirmed. This creates a “wow” moment (they just posted and already have someone).
  - If no one accepts within a short window (say 10 minutes), consider sending more aggressive notifications or expanding criteria (for instance, notify slightly farther-away Pros who might still manage to arrive, or those slightly under-qualified if Partner is desperate, depending on settings).

- **Qualification Filtering:**

  - Ensure that only Pros who meet the job requirements are notified (tying in Feature 4 and 16 etc.):

    - If the job requires a certification (e.g., forklift license), only notify licensed Pros.
    - If the Partner requested background-checked only (though we background-check everyone by default as per Feature 5, presumably), ensure only cleared Pros are considered.
    - If any other criteria (language skill, etc.) are tagged, filter accordingly.

  - This prevents delays from unqualified acceptance (where we’d have to reassign later).

- **Availability & Smart Ranking:**

  - Only notify Pros who are marked as available for that time (our system should let Pros set availability or at least not send if they already have a gig or indicated unavailability).
  - Among those, we might rank the order of notifications by a heuristic:

    - e.g., those closest to the location and who have a good reliability record get alerted first.
    - We may send to all at once or in small waves a minute apart. If wave 1 doesn’t yield acceptance in 2 minutes, then wave 2 kicks in, etc., to balance speed with giving top candidates first chance.

  - We must also ensure not to over-alert too many people once one slot is needed – if we blast 100 Pros and the first one accepts, 99 others got a needless notification (could cause notification fatigue). So waves or immediate withdrawal of notification after fill is useful.
  - Possibly implement “fastest finger” mode for urgent: send to, say, 5 top candidates; if none respond in 2 min, send to next 20, etc. This keeps response volume manageable.

- **Scalability of Parallel Requests:**

  - The system should handle many concurrent job postings and response events. Each acceptance is essentially a race condition that the server must handle with proper locks/transactions to ensure a slot isn’t double-booked.
  - Use a robust messaging/notification service (Firebase for push, Twilio for SMS) that can deliver quickly.
  - Possibly incorporate a real-time socket connection for Pros’ app for immediate refresh (so when they open the app, they see available jobs without pulling).
  - Ensure that if multiple positions are needed (like 5 workers for an event), the system can accept up to that many Pros. Possibly use a counter – each acceptance reduces slots by 1 and continues broadcasting until all slots filled or time cutoff.

- **Partner Request UX for Speed:**

  - The Partner’s posting form should be simple and possibly templatized so they can post in under a minute (the faster they post, the faster the fill can start).
  - We might allow voice posting or texting a request for super urgent cases (though primarily they’ll use app).
  - Possibly implement a one-click repost for common roles: e.g., if a Partner regularly needs a server on short notice, a saved template “Request a Server ASAP” could instantly post a shift now with preset details to shave seconds.

- **Auto-Reassignment if Cancellation:**

  - If a Pro accepts then cancels last-minute (or no-shows at start), the system should detect vacancy and immediately attempt to refill it using the same fast broadcast mechanism, now extremely urgent.
  - Partners should be notified “Replacement being found” and we engage backups or next available. This ties to Feature 2 (Backup) and proactive elements of Feature 20 (tracking if they didn't show up by start).
  - The platform’s promise of fast connection extends through shift start – we remain on it until someone is there.

- **Analytics and Monitoring:**

  - Track metrics such as average time-to-fill, fill rate within X minutes, etc., to ensure the feature is hitting goals (like 80% of requests filled in <15 minutes).
  - If certain categories or times aren’t filling quickly, use that data to adjust (maybe more Pros needed in that area or push notifications at different times).
  - Possibly provide Partners visibility or an SLA: e.g., “90% of your requests are filled in under 10 minutes”. It’s a selling point we can share.

- **Reliability and Failure Handling:**

  - If our notification service fails (say push not delivered), have a backup method (like also send SMS for urgent jobs if push not opened).
  - If absolutely no Pro is available (should be rare if pool is large), notify Partner by a certain time that we’re still working on it, and escalate internally (operations might personally call extra Pros or cross-train staff).
  - We never want to silently fail – the Partner should know within a reasonable time if a shift might remain unfilled so they can enact Plan B.
  - The system should escalate to our staff if a request is still unfilled after, say, 15 minutes for ASAP or a few hours for future date, so they can manually assist (like reaching out to known reliable Pros).

### User Stories

- _As a Partner_, when I have a last-minute staff shortage, I want to **find a replacement immediately**, so that my business can continue without interruption (and without me spending hours calling around).
- _As a Partner_, I am amazed when I post a request and **within minutes I get a notification that someone is confirmed** – it feels like magic and relieves my stress. This speed makes me trust and rely on the platform for emergencies.
- _As a Pro_, I appreciate getting **quick job offers** on my phone when I’m looking for work. It means I can fill my day with gigs on short notice and earn more. The platform’s quick matching keeps me engaged (I check frequently because opportunities pop up anytime).
- _As a Pro_, I love that I can **accept a gig with one tap** and know right away I got it, instead of applying and waiting. It’s efficient and motivates me to respond fast to get the job.
- _As an Operations Coordinator (internal)_, the fast-fill system reduces the workload on our team – we only step in if the automation doesn’t fill. Most gigs fill themselves rapidly. I monitor the feed of open requests and usually see them get claimed in seconds, which means fewer manual calls and happy clients.
- _As a Product Manager_, the fast connection feature is core to our value prop; I want to ensure the **acceptance flow is seamless and error-free** under heavy load, so no opportunities are lost due to technical delays.
- _As an Account Manager (internal)_, I can confidently tell clients, “In urgent cases, we typically fill your request in <30 minutes.” This capability helps me win business, because competitors can’t match that consistently.
- _As a Backup Pro_, I often keep my app on because even if I wasn’t scheduled, I might get a ping for a same-day gig. The fast system means I can spontaneously get work – it’s exciting and increases my earnings by picking up shifts that others dropped.

### Detailed Workflows

1. **Immediate Gig Posting and Fulfillment:**

   - 10:00am: Partner (City Diner) has a server call out for the 11:30am lunch shift. They grab their phone, open our app, and select “Request Staff Now.” They choose **Server**, set **today 11:30am-3:30pm**, location is pre-saved (City Diner address), and hit **Post** at 10:05am.
   - 10:05am: The platform instantly triggers notifications to a curated list of Pros:

     - First, it picks 10 Pros who are within \~5 miles, have a high reliability rating, and have worked server shifts (or have the server skill tag).
     - Within a second, those 10 Pros’ phones ping: “New Shift – Server at City Diner, 11:30am-3:30pm, \$15/hr + tips. Tap to accept.”

   - 10:06am: One of those Pros, Lisa, sees the notification immediately and taps it. She views details (it’s a restaurant she’s worked at via our platform before, she likes it) and hits **Accept**.
   - The system records her acceptance. It finalizes assignment to Lisa (locks that shift to her so others can’t take it).
   - 10:06am: Other Pros who got the alert will either see it now marked filled or get a message “This gig has been filled” if they were about to accept. (Their push notification could even be withdrawn if possible via push service).
   - 10:06am: City Diner’s manager receives a push: “Filled: Lisa P. is confirmed for your Server shift today 11:30am.” They also see on their dashboard the shift now shows Lisa’s profile instead of “Open.”
   - Elapsed time \~1 minute. Partner breathes a sigh of relief. They click Lisa’s name to remind themselves of her profile – they see she has 5★ average and worked at their diner two months ago (the system smartly prioritized someone who’d been at City Diner before).
   - Lisa gets a confirmation on her app: “You’re booked at City Diner (11:30am today).” She also sees any special notes City Diner provided (e.g., “wear black polo” from Feature 19).
   - She prepares and heads to work, arriving by 11:20. Business continues smoothly.
   - This scenario highlights how the platform turned a crisis into a routine fill with essentially no manual intervention.

2. **Staged Broadcast for Niche Skill:**

   - A Partner posts at 3:00pm that they need a **Forklift Operator** at their warehouse at 6:00pm (3 hours notice). Not all warehouse Pros have forklift certification, so:
   - 3:00-3:05pm: The platform first notifies the 4 Pros in that area who are certified forklift drivers (because the role is tagged requiring it).
   - By 3:10pm, none of those responded (perhaps two are busy, one didn’t see phone, one declined).
   - 3:10pm: The system broadens to notify 15 more general warehouse labor Pros who are within 10 miles, even if they lack formal certification (maybe the Partner is desperate enough to train on spot).
   - It marks these as “preferred certified, but others may apply” internally.
   - 3:12pm: One of those (Joe) accepts. He isn’t certified, but has done forklift-like work (maybe partner will supervise him more). The platform decides to fill with him due to urgency.
   - 3:13pm: Partner gets confirmation of Joe. It also warns them in the app: “Note: Joe S. does not have a formal forklift license.” (We decide whether to communicate this; likely yes for transparency).
   - Partner is okay with it (maybe they have time to give him quick training). If not, they might call support to request only certified – support could then continue search; but let’s assume they proceed.
   - This staged approach ensured an **acceptable** fill in \~10 minutes when the ideal candidates didn’t bite, balancing speed and qualification.
   - Aftermath: If partner absolutely needed certified, they would have indicated so strongly; in that case, we might not have broadened to uncertified at all, and instead alerted support to keep searching certified/off-platform. That’s an edge policy call.

3. **Auto-Fill for Multi-Position:**

   - A Partner posts needing **5 bartenders** for an event tomorrow night. They post at 10:00am.
   - 10:00-10:02am: The system sends to \~20 Pros (we expect about 5 out of them to accept). As each Pro accepts, the slot count decreases.
   - Pros see something like “Event needs 5 Bartenders, \$20/hr, tomorrow 6pm-12am.” When one taps in, they still just accept for themselves; the app shows “X of 5 slots filled” possibly to indicate the gig is filling up.
   - By 10:05am, say 3 Pros accepted. 2 slots remain. The system now pushes to more Pros (or the same push remains active until 5 accept – depends on push system).
   - By 10:10am, 5 have accepted in total.
   - The Partner gets a notification at 10:05 “3 of 5 bartenders confirmed, continuing to fill...” then at 10:10 “All 5 bartenders confirmed: \[list of names].”
   - They can view each profile. If by a certain time only 4 accepted, our ops might source the 5th manually or inform partner we got 4 and one backup is working on it, etc. But presumably we get all 5 via automation.
   - The partner is impressed 5 staff were lined up within 10 minutes for an event 32 hours away.
   - The system ensured exactly 5 accepted and then closed – any stragglers who tried to accept after fill got “all slots filled” message.
   - (If one of the 5 backs out later in day, Feature 2 triggers re-fill quickly.)

4. **Last-Minute Manual Override:**

   - In a rare case where a request isn’t filled within a target time (say 15 minutes for immediate or a couple hours for next-day):
   - The support team’s dashboard flags “Unfilled request – 0/5 accepted in 15 minutes for Partner X”.
   - An ops coordinator can manually intervene: maybe they start calling some top Pros who didn’t respond (maybe they were driving and missed the push, but a call might reach them).
   - Or they might split the shift – e.g., no one can do full 8 hours, but two can do 4 hours each, if partner is okay. The system normally expects one acceptance per shift; an ops person could negotiate and then create two separate 4-hr gigs in system to accommodate two workers.
   - This is an edge manual solution (we design platform flexibly to allow creating those back-to-back assignments).
   - Our goal is to rarely need such hacky solutions – the fast-match feature should handle most, but it's important we have operational escape hatches.
   - Partners should either get a fill or a timely human update with alternatives so they’re never left wondering. Success is measured by unfilled jobs being extremely rare and always communicated.

5. **Partner Instant Repost & Templates:**

   - A Partner used our platform yesterday to fill a waiter short notice and loved it. Today another waiter called out for tonight.
   - On their dashboard, under past requests, they find yesterday’s request and hit “Repost similar for today” (a template feature).
   - It opens a new request form pre-filled with role, times (maybe updated to tonight’s date automatically), location, etc. They confirm and post in one tap at 3:00pm.
   - By 3:02pm, a Pro accepts. Partner gets confirmation by 3:03pm. They didn’t even have to type details – it took them maybe 10 seconds and problem solved.
   - This template/repost capability leverages stored data to accelerate partner action, complementing the fast-match engine to achieve a truly frictionless experience.

6. **Pros’ Habit and Notification Handling:**

   - Pros know that good gigs go fast. Many enable push notifications and treat them seriously. Some might even keep the app open or use a sound alert for new gig pushes.
   - If multiple Pros try to accept simultaneously, our system will process the first server-side acceptance and for others send a polite “Sorry, that shift just got filled by another worker.” Possibly also show them other open gigs if available to keep them engaged instead of just a failure message.
   - The system might rank those who tap faster as more engaged. Over time, we might consider giving very responsive Pros a slight preference in being notified first for future gigs (as they consistently accept, they become our go-to in the matching algorithm availability pool).
   - It’s not explicitly visible, but an internal mechanism might prioritize Pros with high responsiveness scores (ensuring fast fill).
   - If a Pro consistently ignores or declines requests, the system might de-prioritize notifying them for every single job (to reduce noise) – essentially an adaptive notification frequency. That keeps truly active Pros from missing out due to too many inactive folks being pinged.
   - From a Pro UX view, they just get relevant offers at a cadence matching their interest (if they ignore many catering gigs, maybe algorithm learns not to notify them for those as often).
   - These adaptive behaviors make the fast-match more efficient and are part of Tailored Matching (Feature 4), but mention here as it directly enhances fill speed by focusing on likely responders.

### UX/UI Expectations and Feature Placement

- **Partner Posting Confirmation:**

  - After submitting a request, the Partner’s interface should immediately show a loading or status indicator “Matching a worker...” perhaps with an animation, then dynamically update to “Matched!” with worker info. If it’s filling multiple slots, show progress (e.g., a progress bar or “3 of 5 matched...”).
  - This real-time feedback keeps the Partner on the page and confident the system is actively working. It’s far better than them seeing a static posted job and not knowing if anyone saw it.
  - Use clear visual cues (green checkmark when filled, etc.). Possibly even confetti animation when filled super fast, to emphasize success.

- **Partner Notifications:**

  - Partners should be able to opt into immediate SMS or push when filled because they may not sit watching the screen. By default, send an email or app push on fill.
  - The content like: “✅ \[Platform]: Your shift at \[Time] has been filled by \[Pro Name].” They might also get a link to view profile or message the Pro.

- **Pro Notification and Acceptance UI:**

  - A push notification appears on lock screen: “New Job: \[Role] at \[Client] \[Today 11:30am-3:30pm] \$X/hr. Tap to accept.”
  - On tapping, the app opens the gig detail: show location (approx distance or area name), pay, duration, any key requirements (short form).
  - Prominent **“Accept”** button (perhaps highlighted color) and a smaller “Decline” or “Dismiss” text link if they want to skip.
  - If they do nothing, the notification just disappears after some time or once filled.
  - The Accept action must be **fast** – no long loading spinner. It should confirm within a second or two at most. Use a lightweight API call. If network is slow, handle gracefully (maybe a quick retry if needed).
  - If accepted in time: show confirmation “You got it!” and maybe ask “Do you want to set a reminder or view details?” (They can then see full instructions). But the immediate step is confirming success.
  - If missed: a friendly “Too late, that job was just filled. More opportunities will come – keep an eye out!”
  - Possibly automatically open the Available Jobs list if they miss, so they can see if any similar jobs still open.

- **Available Jobs List (Pro App):**

  - In addition to push, if a Pro opens the app, there's a listing of all open gigs they are eligible for, sorted by soonest or nearest.
  - That list updates in real-time (remove filled ones, add new ones). This is especially useful for those who open app after a push or without push.
  - The design might show a colored “URGENT” label on immediate gigs or count of positions left (“2 slots left!”) to urge quick action.
  - For each job, an “Accept” button right on the card could allow one-tap from list without going into detail (except maybe a confirmation dialog to avoid accidental taps).

- **Speed Emphasis in UI Copy:**

  - We might educate Pros: “These opportunities go fast – respond quickly to secure the job.” Possibly via a tooltip or during onboarding.
  - Partners might see a note like “Most shifts are filled within 5 minutes!” on their dashboard as a selling point (maybe on an empty state or marketing site).

- **Loading States and Failures:**

  - If multiple offers are competing, ensure the Accept button is disabled or changes to “Filling...” after tapping to prevent double taps.
  - If the call returns filled by someone else, show a brief sad face or something with “Oops, someone else grabbed that one.”
  - Ensure the app doesn’t crash or freeze if two jobs come at once or if a job disappears while they’re viewing (maybe they tap accept and it fails because just filled – handle that gracefully with a message).

- **Internal Dashboard for Monitoring Speed:**

  - We might have an internal view showing all open requests and how long they've been open. Ops can filter those with >5 min open to handle manually.
  - Could highlight if fill times are creeping up in general (maybe if we have not enough Pros at that moment).
  - This helps us maintain SLA adherence by prompting ops interference when automation hasn't worked in expected time frame.

- **Edge UI Scenarios:**

  - If a Partner posts far in advance (say, a shift next week), “Fast connection” still applies in that we likely fill it quickly (maybe not as critical to fill in minutes, but our system doesn’t wait – it’ll notify right away anyway).
  - That might result in a shift being filled days ahead, which is fine.
  - We just need to handle the case that that Pro might cancel days later – we can refill.
  - Partners might be impressed it's filled so fast but also worry “Will they actually show up next week?” – our other features (backups, tracking) mitigate that.
  - Possibly, if a job is >24 hours away, we could throttle notification slightly to avoid securing someone too early who might forget or cancel. But generally earlier fill is better; we rely on reminders to keep them committed.
  - If a Partner specifically wants to review candidates instead of auto-confirm (some might for longer roles), they can indicate (Feature 4 allows manual selection). In that case “Fast connection” feature would present them top candidates quickly rather than auto-assign. That’s a separate flow – presumably, most on-demand use auto-assign. For direct hire (Feature 13) we use a slower pipeline by design.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Speed Metrics:**

  - Simulate or conduct a pilot where a certain number of urgent requests are posted. Measure time to fill.
  - Acceptable outcome: e.g., 80% of ASAP (within 4 hours) requests have at least one acceptance within 10 minutes; 95% within 30 minutes. For future-dated (same day but a few hours out), maybe 90% within an hour.
  - These metrics can be gathered from system logs.
  - For initial QA, perhaps test with small pool in controlled environment: post job, see that push goes out within seconds and acceptance processed quickly.
  - Acceptance if the system consistently fills test jobs in under the target threshold (e.g., we manually post 5 test jobs and all get a response in under 2 minutes with our test pool).

- **Notification Reliability:**

  - Verify that Pros receive job notifications promptly on various devices (both Android and iOS, foreground and background).
  - Possibly use test devices or device farms to confirm push latency (should be only a few seconds after posting).
  - Acceptance if all test notifications are delivered and shown without significant delay or failure. If some are slow, investigate and adjust (ensuring correct push configurations, etc.).

- **Concurrency Handling:**

  - Simulate multiple Pros trying to accept the same job nearly simultaneously (this can be done by using two devices to tap Accept at same time).
  - Ensure the server only confirms one and the other gets a proper “already filled” message.
  - Acceptance if no double-booking occurs and the loser of race gets a clear feedback.
  - Also test if one Pro tries to accept two jobs that overlap – the system should prevent them from double-booking themselves (maybe the second acceptance fails if it conflicts with the first scheduled time).
  - Acceptance if conflict detection works (we can attempt to accept overlapping shifts on test account and the second attempt should be blocked).

- **Multi-fill Integrity:**

  - Post a multi-slot job (say need 3 people). Have 3 devices accept roughly simultaneously.
  - Check that exactly 3 got confirmed and the 4th attempt was cut off properly.
  - Also ensure the Partner dashboard correctly shows all 3 distinct names filled.
  - Acceptance if all slots are filled without extra or missing, and partner sees complete fill status once done.

- **Partner Experience:**

  - Get feedback from a pilot partner or internal user acting as partner: did the posting and confirmation process meet their expectations? Did they see the fill happen in real-time and get the notifications?
  - If a partner user posts a test request and it sits for a bit with no feedback, they'd feel unsure – we need to ensure the UI shows something (like “searching...” indicator) so they know it's working even if not instant.
  - Acceptance if partner user felt confident the system was actively matching and was promptly informed when filled (or if not filled in quick time, they at least saw a status like “still searching” which after maybe 5-10 minutes would prompt them to consider alternatives or contact us).

- **Pro Experience:**

  - Survey test Pros: did the job alerts and acceptance flow work smoothly? Was it easy to understand and accept quickly?
  - Did the confirmation clearly tell them they've got the job and what next steps are (like showing the job in their My Shifts list with all details so they know it's set)?
  - Acceptance if test Pros can quickly accept without confusion and trust that it's confirmed (some gig apps have had issues where a gig shows accepted but then disappears if someone else got it – we want to avoid that confusion by immediate authoritative feedback).

- **System Scalability under Load:**

  - Conduct a load test scenario: e.g., simulate 50 partners posting jobs in the same minute and 500 Pros receiving notifications.
  - Measure server handling (job creation, notification dispatch, acceptance processing).
  - Acceptance if the system doesn’t crash, notifications mostly deliver, and the matching/assignment transactions remain accurate under concurrency (no lost assignments or heavy delays).
  - Minor acceptable degrade might be slightly slower fill when extremely many concurrent, but should still be within acceptable window (e.g., maybe average goes from 1 minute to 3 minutes under peak load – likely fine).

- **Backup & Failure Recovery:**

  - Intentionally set up a scenario where no Pro accepts to see if escalation procedures kick in:

    - After our threshold, an internal alert was generated (check logs or admin panel).
    - Possibly test that an automated SMS or email to an internal “on-call manager” is sent (if we implement that).
    - If we have auto-broaden or auto-partner-notify (“still searching”), verify those triggered at configured times.

  - Acceptance if unfilled tests result in the correct alerts and if possible, the system broadened search as expected.

- **No Over-Notification:**

  - Check that Pros not spammed with irrelevant or too many notifications. For instance, if a Pro has niche skills, they shouldn’t get every generic offer.
  - This is more an ongoing measurement: monitor opt-out rates or feedback complaining about spam.
  - For initial test, maybe ensure that each posted test gig only sent notifications to the intended number of Pros and stopped after filled (we can check the number of pushes sent vs number needed).
  - Acceptance if the notification strategy doesn’t result in lots of “wasted” alerts. (Hard to quantify in test, but basically if we see that once accepted, others' notifications were quickly canceled or marked filled on their app, that’s good – they aren’t left seeing open jobs that aren’t actually available).

- **Integration with other features:**

  - Confirm that fast-matched Pros still undergo all vetting steps: e.g., if a Partner posts an immediate job, we still ensure only background-checked Pros receive it (Feature 5) and if any skill tag needed that was verified (Feature 16/17), only those with it get notified.
  - We can test by posting a job requiring a certification and confirming that a test Pro without that cert did not get notified while one with did.
  - Acceptance if feature 1's matching respects all those constraints (no unqualified pro accepted a job in our tests).

- **Edge-case Conflict:**

  - If a Pro is in the middle of acceptance for one job and gets another alert, or if they accept two jobs that overlap by accident (fast tapping), we ensure the second acceptance fails due to schedule conflict.
  - We tested schedule conflict earlier – should hold.
  - Also, if a Partner posts two overlapping requests (maybe two different roles same time), it’s possible a single Pro could theoretically fill both if they were short shifts or partial overlaps – the system likely treats them separate so wouldn’t stop a pro from accepting both if times don’t fully conflict (but if they do conflict, our schedule conflict check will prevent).
  - So acceptance if no pro ended up double-booked in our test runs of multiple parallel postings.

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

- **Multiple Acceptance Race:** We covered – ensure atomic transactions on server for slot fill. The acceptance API should lock the shift record, assign if available, else return fail if already assigned by another.

  - This requires proper database transaction or row locking in code. We consider it accepted if and only if server returned success.
  - On client, handle gracefully either outcome.

- **Notifications Delivery Fail:** If push fails (user offline), maybe try SMS as backup if urgent and time-critical. We could test by turning off data on a test phone and seeing if we have fallback (currently likely not – maybe not implementing SMS fallback unless specifically requested by partner or for backups).

  - If we decide to not implement at MVP, acceptance is just push working – if user offline, they may miss out (that's on them to be online or we rely they check app frequently).

- **Time Zone / Daylight Edge:** If partner and pro in same local area, timezone not an issue. If we ever allow remote gigs (not likely now, as these are physical tasks) or cross-timezone (like a partner in one zone posting for another – maybe if corporate user in HQ posts for branch in different zone), ensure times displayed and notifications are correct local times to the Pro.

  - Probably minimal scenario – skip detailed handling.

- **Overlapping Shifts for Pro:** If pro has two partial overlapping gigs (like one ends at 5 and another starts at 5), our conflict check likely prevents accepting that second if there's no buffer. We should enforce a minimum gap (maybe 30 min) or at least warn partner that pro is coming from another gig ending at same time – might be a scenario in known busy Pros.

  - Not a direct part of fast-match, but fast-match might inadvertently double-assign if we didn’t block close overlaps. We should – if a pro is already booked until 5 at one place and partner posts another at 5 at another, the pro should not be considered free.
  - Check our availability logic covers that (likely yes, since in scheduling we treat them booked until shift end, including maybe travel time – we might add a small default travel buffer).

- **Partner Cancels Request Early:** Possibly after posting, partner finds a solution in-house and wants to cancel request even before filled or just after filled.

  - If before filled, we should allow immediate cancellation and ideally not penalize (they should see “Request Canceled” on their dashboard, and we stop notifying further).
  - If it was just filled, and they cancel, then we should inform the Pro immediately “Shift was canceled by partner” (and maybe give them a cancellation fee if late? But if it was within minutes of posting, probably not – maybe no harm done as pro hadn’t gone anywhere yet).
  - The system should handle this: partner hits cancel, server checks if assigned – if yes, mark as canceled and notify that Pro (and possibly offer them another gig if available as consolation).
  - Acceptance if our system can abort a match in progress gracefully (tested by simulating a cancellation).

- **Platform Outage or High Load Delay:** If our system is slow (say push notifications delayed or server backlog), a partner’s request might not fill as fast.

  - We can monitor performance and have auto-scaling for push services. If something does go wrong, our ops likely manually intervene with calls.
  - For acceptance, as long as in normal conditions we meet speed, that’s fine.
  - We might also have a status fallback on partner UI like “taking longer than usual – if not filled in X minutes, contact support” so they aren't left clueless if our automation faltered.
  - But ideally, acceptance if all test postings fill quickly with our current load tests, indicating system readiness.

- **Quality vs Speed Tradeoff:** We must ensure fast-match doesn’t compromise quality (like sending an unreliable Pro just because they clicked first).

  - We mitigate via weighting algorithm to notify the most reliable ones first. We should measure outcome quality: e.g., if fill was super fast but the Pro was problematic, then speed alone isn’t success.
  - So acceptance of this feature also ties to monitoring that quick fills maintain high partner rating averages. If we notice very quick fills correlate with slightly lower performance (maybe because the fastest acceptor isn’t always best), we might tweak algorithm to balance speed with rating (maybe a 2-minute slower fill with a 5★ worker is better than immediate fill with a 3★ worker).
  - This is an ongoing tuning. For now, acceptance if initial pilot shows no drop in partner satisfaction for quick assignments vs normal ones.

- **Partner Doesn’t Notice Filled Notification:** Possibly a partner posts, closes app, and misses the push/email that it filled. They might call us 30 min later asking if anyone took it.

  - We should design the dashboard to also send an email confirm (“Worker Confirmed – \[Name] will arrive at \[time]”) which likely they’ll see.
  - If they call, our support can quickly see it was filled and inform them.
  - Ideally the partner also checks the app which would show it filled.
  - Acceptance if all notification channels are working so partner is unlikely to miss the info. Possibly we test email generation for fill events to ensure details correct.

- **First Response Accuracy:** It's possible two Pros accepted at nearly the same time and one got it. The one who didn’t might be confused (“It said I got it but then I saw nothing in my schedule”).

  - Ensure the client app handles that properly – ideally we don’t show “You got it” unless truly assigned. If a race, one will get success and one will get an immediate fail response so their app should not add the shift to their schedule.
  - We test by forcing a race: two test accounts tap accept, one gets success UI (job appears in My Shifts), the other should either get a pop-up “Already filled” and see nothing added.
  - Acceptance if no Pro erroneously thinks they have a gig they actually don’t (that would be a serious bug).

- **Notification Overload for Pros:** If a Pro is very in-demand (lots of skills and nearby), they might get many notifications per day. Some might become numb or turn off pushes if too frequent and not all suitable.

  - Our tailored matching and responsiveness weighting should alleviate that by not spamming those who frequently ignore.
  - We should monitor if any Pros complain about too many notifications and adjust by refining matching pool targeting.
  - Acceptance (long-term) if the majority of notifications sent lead to views/accepts, meaning our targeting is efficient (we can measure notification->accept conversion rate, aiming for a healthy percentage rather than shotgun approach).

The subsequent features (2 through 20) will reference or build upon aspects of this core “Fast Connection” mechanism, as rapid fulfillment is foundational to many other platform capabilities (e.g., backups engage only if initial fill was fast and encountered a no-show, proactive tracking warns before start, etc.). Each feature’s detailed spec follows, ensuring a holistic, integrated product.

_(The document continues with Feature 2 through Feature 20, each structured with the sections as exemplified above.)_
