# SaaS Order Management System (OMS) – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction and Product Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for a **SaaS Order Management System (OMS)**. The target audience is product managers overseeing the development of a cloud-based OMS solution. The OMS will enable businesses to streamline order processing from quote creation to final delivery, manage inventory in real-time, and integrate with key external services. It aims to support multi-channel sales operations, improve fulfillment efficiency, and provide robust reporting and analytics for informed decision-making.

**Product Vision:** The SaaS OMS will serve as a centralized hub for all order-related activities. It will **automate and simplify the entire order lifecycle** – from capturing customer orders or quotes, through inventory allocation and shipping, to delivery confirmation and potential returns. By leveraging a cloud-based architecture, the system will be accessible anywhere and easily scalable to accommodate growth. Businesses can expect reduced manual work, fewer errors, faster order turnaround, and improved customer satisfaction with this OMS in place.

**Goals and Objectives:**

- **Streamline Order Processing:** Automate routine tasks (order entry, inventory updates, shipping notifications) to reduce manual effort and errors, resulting in faster fulfillment and more orders processed per hour/day.
- **Real-Time Visibility:** Provide **real-time inventory tracking** across all warehouses and sales channels so users always know stock levels and product availability, preventing overselling and stockouts.
- **Unified Management:** Consolidate management of orders from multiple channels (e-commerce, retail, B2B, etc.) into one system for consistency and ease of use. Similarly, centralize customer data and product catalog information to avoid duplication and data silos.
- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Ensure customers receive accurate information on product availability, order status, and prompt issue resolution through improved internal processes. Faster processing and accurate tracking will lead to higher customer satisfaction.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Offer robust reporting and analytics tools to analyze sales trends, inventory turnover, and operational performance. This will help stakeholders make informed decisions on stock procurement, sales strategies, and process improvements.
- **Scalability and Reliability:** Build the platform to handle growing business needs (more orders, more users, more SKUs) without significant performance degradation. The system should be highly available and secure, instilling confidence that it can be trusted for mission-critical operations.
- **Compliance and Auditability:** Design with compliance requirements (like GDPR for data privacy) in mind. All actions should be auditable to meet regulatory and internal policy standards, and data retention policies should be configurable for legal compliance.

**Scope:** This PRD covers the full range of requirements for the OMS:

- Functional requirements detailing the specific features and behaviors of the system.
- Non-functional requirements outlining performance, security, and other quality attributes.
- Definitions of user roles and their permissions.
- User stories with acceptance criteria to capture the user-centric view of major features.
- An overview of the system’s architecture and integration points with external systems (shipping carriers, payment gateways, CRM, etc.).
- UX considerations guiding the design and interface priorities.
- Reporting and analytics capabilities needed by end-users.
- Data retention policies, audit trails, and compliance requirements.
- A high-level roadmap with feature prioritization and dependencies.

**Out of Scope:** While comprehensive, this document does not include low-level design or implementation details, UI mockups, or a detailed project plan. It focuses on what the system should do (requirements) rather than how to technically implement each feature. The specific configurations of third-party systems (like detailed setup of a particular carrier’s API) are also beyond the scope; here we define the requirement to integrate, not the exact technical API contract.

## 1. Functional Requirements

This section describes what **functions and features** the OMS must provide. These are organized by major capability areas. Each subsection includes key requirements for that area.

### 1.1 Real-Time Inventory Availability & Stock Level Tracking

One of the core features of the OMS is **inventory management** that is **real-time, accurate, and visible across the organization**. The system should maintain a perpetual inventory count that updates immediately as sales orders, returns, and stock adjustments occur.

- **Live Stock Updates:** The system **shall update inventory counts immediately** when orders are placed, modified, or canceled, and when stock is received or adjusted. This ensures that **stock levels are always current and accurate**, minimizing the risk of selling items that are out of stock. For example, if a customer places an order for 5 units of a product, the available stock for that product should decrease by 5 the moment the order is confirmed (or reserved at quote acceptance).
- **Global Inventory View:** Users (with the appropriate role) **shall be able to view inventory levels** for each product **across all warehouses and selling channels in one consolidated view**. The UI will display total stock, reserved stock (committed to open orders), and available-to-promise stock. It should also break down stock by location (warehouse A: X units, warehouse B: Y units, etc.).
- **Low Stock Alerts:** The OMS **should monitor stock levels** against predefined thresholds. Users can set a **reorder level** per SKU; when inventory falls below this level (or is predicted to, given pending orders), the system will trigger an alert or notification. This helps inventory managers proactively reorder or transfer stock to avoid stockouts.
- **Stock Reservations:** When quotes are created or orders entered, the system should optionally **reserve stock** for that quote/order (configurable based on business rules). This ensures that while a quote is being finalized or an order is pending payment, the promised inventory is not sold to someone else. Reserved stock should be reflected in the available-to-promise calculation.
- **Inventory Audits & Adjustments:** The system shall allow authorized users (e.g., Warehouse Operator or Admin) to perform inventory counts/audits and adjust stock levels. Adjustments (positive or negative) should require a reason code (e.g., “shrinkage”, “damage”, “cycle count adjustment”) for audit trail purposes. Such changes should be logged (who did it, when, old and new quantity) as part of the audit trail (see section 8).
- **Multiple Units of Measure:** If applicable, the system should support tracking inventory in different units of measure (e.g., individual units, cases, pallets) and be able to convert between them for reporting and ordering. (This may depend on product types, and could be a stretch goal or future enhancement if needed for certain industries.)
- **Batch/Lot & Serial Tracking:** _(Optional, depends on requirements)_ For products that have batch numbers or serial numbers, the system should allow tracking inventory at that granularity. This includes assigning specific serials to outgoing orders or logging which batch a product came from (useful for recalls, warranties, etc.). This is particularly relevant for industries like electronics (serial numbers) or food/pharma (lot numbers and expiration dates).

**Rationale:** Real-time and accurate inventory information is critical for order management. **By providing visibility into inventory across multiple locations, the OMS enables informed decisions about reordering and fulfillment, reducing overselling and stockouts.** This directly contributes to customer satisfaction (no more selling what you don’t have) and operational efficiency (optimizing stock levels and storage costs).

### 1.2 Order Entry and Conversion (Quotes to Orders)

The OMS must support the **creation of quotes** (draft orders) and their conversion to actual sales orders once approved. This feature is essential for businesses that provide estimates or pro-forma invoices to customers before finalizing an order (common in B2B or high-value sales).

- **Quote Creation:** Users with sales permissions (e.g., Sales Agent) shall be able to **create a new quote** in the system. A quote is a provisional order that lists products (and quantities), pricing (which may be editable for special deals), and a prospective customer. It does not reserve inventory permanently or execute payment, but it may optionally hold inventory as a reservation (see Inventory section). The quote should have a validity period (e.g., prices guaranteed for 30 days).
- **Quote Versioning:** The system should allow updating a quote (e.g., changing quantities, adding/removing items, adjusting prices) and keep track of **versions or revisions**. Sales agents often revise quotes based on customer negotiation. It’s important to have an audit trail or history of changes (at least comments or timestamped changes) for reference. Only the latest active quote version can be converted to an order.
- **Convert to Order:** The OMS shall provide a one-click or guided process to **convert an accepted quote into an order**. When a customer agrees to the quote, the sales agent marks it as accepted and converts it. The system then transforms the quote to a regular **sales order**, carrying over all line items, prices, customer info, etc., from the quote. The order now behaves like any standard order (will trigger fulfillment, payment processing, etc., as per workflow).
- **Direct Order Entry:** In addition to quote conversion, the system must allow **direct order entry** (for scenarios where a quote is not needed). A Sales Agent or Customer Service rep can create a new order directly, entering customer info and items. This could be used for phone orders, in-person orders, or any manual order channel.
- **Order Editing and Approval:** Depending on business rules, some orders might need managerial approval (for example, if an order exceeds a certain value or if a manual discount is given beyond a threshold). The system should allow marking an order as “pending approval” and allow an authorized role (perhaps Admin or a Manager role) to approve or reject it. Alternatively, this can be handled by using quotes (manager approves the quote before conversion). This requirement can be refined based on specific company policy, but the system should be flexible to support an approval step if needed.
- **Order Status Tracking:** Upon creation (whether via quote conversion or direct entry), an order record is generated with a unique Order ID. The order shall have statuses that track its progress (e.g., **New**, **Pending Payment**, **Confirmed**, **Fulfillment in Progress**, **Shipped**, **Delivered**, **Closed**). Initially, a new order might be in “New” or “Confirmed” state depending on whether payment is captured upfront. (If the system integrates with payments, see section 5, the payment result may affect the order confirmation.)
- **Pricing and Tax Calculation:** When creating quotes or orders, the system must compute line-item totals, subtotals, taxes, and order totals. It should integrate with a pricing engine or allow manual price override (with proper permissions) for quotes. Tax calculation might integrate with a tax service or have rules (especially for SaaS usage across regions). The user should see the breakdown clearly (e.g., “Product total: \$100, Tax: \$10, Shipping: \$5, Grand Total: \$115”).
- **Discounts and Promotions:** The OMS should allow applying discounts at the line item or order level (as a percentage or fixed amount). Promotions could be codes entered that apply predefined discounts. If complex promotional logic is needed (e.g., buy X get Y free, tiered pricing), the system may need a promotions module or integration with one. For the PRD, it’s enough to note that applying discounts to quotes/orders is a requirement, with proper authorization.
- **Attachment/Notes:** Users creating quotes or orders should be able to add **notes or attachments** (e.g., customer purchase order document, special instructions). These should carry over from quote to order. Notes might be internal or customer-facing (e.g., a gift message to print with the packing slip vs an internal note about customer preferences).

**Rationale:** The quote-to-order process is essential for supporting sales workflows where pricing negotiation or formal quotes are part of the cycle. Having it in the OMS ensures continuity (no data re-entry when converting a quote) and accuracy. It improves efficiency by allowing sales to seamlessly turn an accepted quote into an actionable order, fulfilling the agreed terms. Direct order entry covers scenarios where quotes are not needed, ensuring all channels (e.g., customer calls) are captured. Overall, these features increase sales team productivity and reduce order errors.

### 1.3 Shipping Preferences Management (Carriers, Rates, Insurance)

The OMS will handle **shipping management** for orders, including integration with shipping carriers, selection of shipping methods, and handling of shipping-related options like insurance. This ensures orders can be delivered according to customer needs at optimal cost and with tracking.

- **Carrier Integration:** The system shall integrate with major shipping carriers (e.g., UPS, FedEx, DHL, USPS, local couriers) via their APIs to retrieve shipping rates, print labels, and track shipments. Users should be able to **configure carrier accounts** (enter API keys or account credentials in an admin settings area) for those services the business uses. This integration allows real-time rate calculation and label generation directly from the OMS. _(If direct integration is out-of-scope for MVP, the system should at least allow exporting order info to third-party shipping software as a stopgap.)_
- **Shipping Methods and Rates:** When an order is being placed (either by a sales agent or through an integrated e-commerce checkout), the system should display **available shipping options** (e.g., “Standard Ground 5-7 days”, “Express 2-day”, etc.) with cost estimates. These can be fetched from carriers based on package weight/dimensions and destination. The user can select the customer’s preference. The system should support both _customer-arranged pickup/shipping_ and _merchant-arranged shipping_ flows.
- **Shipping Rules:** Administrators should be able to configure **shipping rules** such as free shipping thresholds (e.g., free standard shipping for orders over \$100), flat rate shipping options, or preferred carrier selections by region. This logic ensures the correct options and costs are applied automatically based on order data.
- **Multiple Packages & Split Shipments:** For orders shipping from multiple warehouses or that need to be split into multiple packages, the OMS should support creating multiple shipments under one order. Users (warehouse operators) can indicate which items go in which package/shipment. The system should then handle each with its own tracking number. If an order must ship from two locations, the OMS should facilitate splitting the order and choosing appropriate shipping methods for each part.
- **Insurance and Signature Options:** The system shall allow specifying **shipping insurance** and other special handling for a shipment. For example, if a customer wants to insure an expensive item, the user can add insurance (and the cost will be added to the order, if charged to customer). Similarly, options like “Signature required on delivery” should be supported. These preferences should be communicated to the carrier when generating labels.
- **Label Generation:** Once an order is ready to ship, the warehouse operator (or the system automatically) can request a **shipping label** via the carrier API. The OMS should send the package details (weight, dimensions, service level) and receive a label (PDF or image) and tracking number. The label can then be printed. The OMS should store the tracking number and associate it with the order and the specific shipment.
- **Shipment Tracking:** The OMS shall fetch or receive updates on shipment status using the carrier’s tracking API. This might be done by polling (periodically checking tracking status) or via webhooks if carriers push updates. At minimum, the system should record the tracking number and carrier for each shipment, and provide a quick link or status field (e.g., “In Transit – expected delivery 12/05”) for users to see progress. Integration can be iterative: initial version may just store the number and rely on manual tracking, later adding automatic status updates.
- **Shipping Preferences per Order:** Customer-specific or order-specific shipping preferences should be accommodated. For instance, some customers might always prefer one carrier due to their internal receiving process, or might have their own carrier account (third-party billing). The system should allow specifying “Use customer’s UPS account #” on an order if needed. These special cases should be recorded.
- **International Shipping Considerations:** If the system will be used for international orders, it must handle things like customs documentation. Users should be able to input or generate **commercial invoices**, harmonized codes, etc., and attach to the shipment. (This could be a future/advanced requirement if not needed initially.)
- **Pickup/Store Delivery Options:** In cases of omnichannel retail, the OMS might support orders that are **Buy Online Pickup In Store (BOPIS)** or similar. For such orders, shipping is replaced by a “pickup” workflow. The system should mark them accordingly and not require carrier selection, but instead notify the store for fulfillment. (This can be noted as a possible feature depending on scope.)

**Rationale:** Shipping is often a complex and crucial part of order fulfillment. By integrating carrier management, the OMS reduces the need to use separate systems for shipping, saving time and reducing data entry errors. **Automatically getting rates and generating labels speeds up dispatch and prevents mistakes**, while offering various shipping options improves customer satisfaction (they can choose faster shipping or cheaper options as needed). Insurance and special handling options protect the business and meet customer needs for high-value shipments. Overall, built-in shipping management makes the OMS a one-stop system for order processing through to delivery.

### 1.4 Full Order Tracking Lifecycle (From Quote to Delivery)

The OMS must support and visibly track the **entire lifecycle of an order** from its inception as a quote (if applicable) all the way to final delivery (and even post-delivery actions like returns). This provides end-to-end traceability and management of orders.

- **Status Model:** The system shall implement a clear **order status model** to reflect each stage of the process. Example statuses and transitions:

  - _Draft/Quote:_ (if created as quote) – a preliminary state before becoming an order.
  - _Pending Payment:_ order is created but waiting for payment confirmation (used if payment is external or invoice terms).
  - _Confirmed:_ payment is confirmed (or not required) and order is ready for fulfillment.
  - _In Fulfillment:_ order is being prepared (items are being picked/packed).
  - _Partially Shipped:_ if order has multiple shipments, some have shipped while others pending.
  - _Shipped:_ order fully shipped out, in transit to customer.
  - _Delivered:_ confirmation (possibly via carrier API or manual update) that customer received the items.
  - _Completed/Closed:_ the order process is complete (could coincide with delivered, or post-return window).
  - _Cancelled:_ the order was cancelled (with sub-reasons like customer cancellation, payment failure, fraud hold, etc.).
  - _Returned:_ (if a full order return occurs) – or this could be handled via a separate returns process tracking.

- **Visual Timeline:** In the UI, for each order, present a **timeline or progress bar** indicating where the order is in its lifecycle (Quote → Confirmed → Picked → Shipped → Delivered, etc.). This helps customer service and sales quickly understand the order’s state and next steps. For example, an order might show “Shipped on 5/1/2025 via DHL, in transit – expected by 5/5/2025”.
- **Order Tracking Information:** For each order, the system should display all relevant tracking information: dates/timestamps for key events (order placed, shipped, delivered), the shipping carrier and tracking number (with link to carrier tracking site or integrated tracking info), and any internal notes (e.g., “Delayed due to inventory shortage – backordered item shipped on 5/3”).
- **Notifications & Updates:** The OMS should trigger **notifications at key stages**. For instance:

  - When an order is confirmed (customer could get an order confirmation email – the OMS should either send it or trigger the integrated e-commerce platform to send it).
  - When items are shipped (shipping confirmation email with tracking).
  - When delivered (delivery confirmation email or possibly request for feedback).
  - Internally, if there’s a delay or any exception (e.g., an order stuck in a status too long), it could alert customer support.
  - These notifications can be handled within OMS or via integration with a CRM/marketing email system, but the requirement is to have the hooks for them.

- **Order Hold/Release:** There should be a mechanism to put an order “on hold” (and later release it) if issues arise. For example, a fraud check might put an order on hold, or a customer requested a delay in shipment. While on hold, the order would not appear in the pick/pack queue for warehouse. Users should see a clear indicator if an order is on hold and the reason (maybe via an order flag).
- **Backorder Management:** If an order cannot be fully fulfilled due to stock unavailability, the system should handle **backorders**. This means some items on the order are shipped later when back in stock. The OMS should allow partial shipment (as mentioned) and keep the order open/partially fulfilled until remaining items ship. It should also optionally allow splitting an order line (e.g., ordered 10, shipped 6, 4 on backorder). Alternatively, the remaining quantity could be automatically turned into a new linked order or kept in same order as pending.
- **Returns & Refunds Handling:** _(Though not explicitly listed in the request, for completeness of lifecycle.)_ The system should facilitate **returns** if a customer sends back items. This could be managed via a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) process:

  - A user (customer support) can create a Return record linked to the original order, specifying which items and quantities are coming back and the reason.
  - The system will update inventory (increment stock if the item is resellable) when the return is received, and mark the order or item as returned.
  - If integrated with financial systems, it would trigger a refund or credit process. If not, it at least records that a return happened for reporting.
  - The status of an order that had a return might remain “Completed” but with notes of return, or a separate status like “Refunded” could be used. Regardless, the history should reflect that a return occurred. _(Returns management is often a substantial feature on its own and might be slated for a later phase if not MVP.)_

- **Order History & Audit:** Every change in the order’s status or key fields should be recorded (user and time). Users should be able to see an **order history log** (e.g., “2025-05-01 10:43AM – Status changed from In Fulfillment to Shipped by WH-User1”). This helps in troubleshooting and is also part of audit compliance (see section 8).
- **Link to Financials:** If the OMS does not handle invoicing and payment itself, it should at least mark when an order is invoiced or paid in an external system. Many businesses will integrate OMS to an accounting or ERP system for invoicing. The OMS should store references to any external invoice or transaction IDs and ideally reflect payment status (paid/unpaid/terms).

**Rationale:** A **full lifecycle view ensures that every stakeholder (sales, support, warehouse, management)** knows exactly where an order stands at any time. This end-to-end traceability reduces confusion and errors – for example, support can confidently answer “Where is my order?” questions because the OMS shows real-time status. It also helps identify bottlenecks (if many orders are stuck in “Pending” or “Picking” status, it flags operational issues). By covering scenarios like partial shipments, holds, and returns, the OMS reflects real-world order handling, making it a robust system rather than a simplistic pipeline. Ultimately, a clear lifecycle management improves customer trust (they get accurate updates) and internal efficiency (teams coordinate through one system).

### 1.5 Inventory Management Across Multiple Warehouses

For businesses operating more than one warehouse or fulfillment location, the OMS must handle **multi-warehouse inventory and fulfillment** logic. Inventory is not just a single global figure, but distributed. Orders may ship from different warehouses depending on stock availability and proximity to customer.

- **Per-Warehouse Stock Tracking:** The system shall maintain inventory counts **per warehouse/location**. For each product SKU, there will be records like: Warehouse A – 100 units, Warehouse B – 50 units, etc., summing up to 150 total. The **real-time tracking (1.1)** applies at the warehouse level as well – when an order is allocated to a warehouse, that location’s inventory decreases.
- **Warehouse Catalog Visibility:** It should be possible that some products are only stocked in certain warehouses. The system should allow marking which warehouses carry which products (alternatively, a zero stock implies not carried). If needed, an item could be non-sellable from a particular warehouse (even if theoretically could be moved). These nuances might be configured via catalog settings per warehouse.
- **Order Allocation Logic:** When an order is placed, the OMS should determine **from which warehouse(s) to fulfill it**. Possible strategies (which should be configurable) include:

  - **Single-warehouse fulfillment:** Ship the entire order from one warehouse (to avoid multiple shipments) if all items are available in one location.
  - **Proximity-based:** Choose the nearest warehouse to the customer that has stock to minimize delivery time and cost.
  - **Split fulfillment:** If no single warehouse has the full order, split the order lines among warehouses that have each item.
  - **Priority-based:** Perhaps designate a primary warehouse for certain customers or certain product lines.

  For MVP, a simple rule can be used (e.g., always use Warehouse X as default unless item only in Warehouse Y, or always choose the closest). More advanced allocation can be a later feature. Regardless, the chosen warehouse(s) should be recorded on the order line or shipment.

- **Inter-Warehouse Transfer:** If an item is out of stock in the ordering warehouse but available elsewhere, the system might allow an **inventory transfer** request between warehouses. This is more of an inventory management operation: e.g., Warehouse B sends stock to Warehouse A to fulfill the order. The OMS could support generating a transfer order and tracking its completion. This is a nice-to-have for advanced stock optimization, but might be later-phase. At minimum, the system should flag if stock is available in other locations when one is out of stock, so managers can decide how to fulfill.
- **Warehouse-Specific Pricing or Rules:** (Optional) Some organizations might have different costs or pricing per warehouse (especially if in different countries or tax regimes). The system should primarily handle orders in a unified way, but be aware that the shipping origin (warehouse location) might affect tax calculation or currency. For example, if Warehouse B is in a different country, selling from there could have different VAT implications. This is an advanced scenario and might be handled via integration with tax tools.
- **Geo-Zones and Warehouse Mapping:** Admins should be able to define **fulfillment zones** (group of states, countries) and assign preferred warehouses to those zones. This would guide the automatic allocation (e.g., orders from East Coast ship from Warehouse East if stock available, else fallback to Central, etc.).
- **Separate Warehouse Operations:** The system’s UI should support **warehouse operators managing their specific location**. For example, a warehouse user may log in and see only orders assigned to their warehouse and the inventory of their location. This partitioning by location is important for clarity and permission (a user at Warehouse A should not accidentally operate on Warehouse B’s inventory).
- **Consolidated Inventory View:** While each warehouse is tracked separately, there should also be a consolidated view (as mentioned in 1.1) for inventory managers or admins to see total stock and distribution. This helps in planning and stock balancing decisions.
- **Stock Transfers and Receiving:** In addition to inter-warehouse transfers, the system should handle receiving new stock into each warehouse (could integrate with purchase orders from ERP or be a simple “receive stock” function in OMS if purchasing is outside scope). The act of receiving adds to a warehouse’s inventory and should log which warehouse received how much on what date (and ideally against a supplier or PO record if integrated). _This overlaps with typical Warehouse Management System (WMS) functionality; depending on scope, the OMS might incorporate basic WMS features or integrate with a dedicated WMS._
- **Multi-Warehouse Order Splitting UI:** If an order is split, the system should present it clearly – e.g., on the order detail, group items by “Shipment 1 – from Warehouse A” and “Shipment 2 – from Warehouse B”. Each can be processed separately in the system by the respective warehouse team. Inventory deduction and shipping tracking will occur per shipment.

**Rationale:** Multi-warehouse support is essential for scalability and fulfilling orders efficiently in larger or distributed organizations. **Visibility into inventory across multiple locations ensures the business can leverage all its stock to fill orders**, and also store products closer to customers (reducing shipping times). Proper allocation logic can significantly improve delivery speed and lower shipping costs by using the best location for fulfillment. For internal operations, segregating by warehouse improves clarity and accountability, as each location can focus on its tasks. In sum, these features allow the OMS to serve as an enterprise-level system rather than just a single-store solution, supporting growth and geographic expansion.

### 1.6 Order Processing, Dispatch Management & Product Cataloging

This section covers the **fulfillment execution** (order processing and dispatch) as well as **product catalog management**, which is the backbone supporting orders and inventory.

- **Order Processing (Picking/Packing):** Once an order is confirmed and allocated to a warehouse, the system should facilitate the **picking and packing process**:

  - Generate a **picking list** for warehouse staff. This list details all items that need to be picked for the order (or a batch of orders). It should include item identifiers (SKU, name), quantity, and location in warehouse (if location info is tracked in the system).
  - The OMS might support picking using a mobile device: e.g., an interface to scan barcodes of items to confirm picks. This reduces errors by verifying the correct item is picked. (If not initially, at least printing a picking slip is required, with a barcode or clear info for manual operation.)
  - After picking, the order status can be updated (e.g., “Picked” or directly to “Packing”).
  - For packing, the system should allow the packer to verify quantities and possibly print a **packing slip** (a document to include in the box, listing contents, often doubling as an invoice/receipt for the customer). The packing slip can be generated by the system with order details.
  - If the system is integrated with shipping (as per 1.3), after packing, the user will generate the shipping label and finalize the shipment.
  - Once shipped, the order is updated to “Shipped” status with tracking number recorded.

- **Batch Order Processing:** The OMS should support processing orders one by one, but also provide **batch processing capabilities** for efficiency:

  - For example, a warehouse user might select multiple orders and print all their pick lists at once, or generate shipping labels in bulk (assuming weights are known or uniform).
  - The system might also support wave picking (picking items for multiple orders in one pass through the warehouse to optimize path), but that could be an advanced feature possibly integrated with a WMS. Initially, even simple batch printing of labels or packing slips is useful.

- **Order Cancellation:** As part of processing, users need the ability to **cancel orders** (or specific items on an order) if needed. Cancellation rules:

  - An order can be canceled if it has not yet shipped. If partially shipped, maybe remaining items can be canceled.
  - On cancel, inventory reservations are released or put back to stock if already deducted.
  - If payment was captured, a refund process is initiated (via integration to payment gateway).
  - The OMS should require a reason for cancellation (e.g., customer request, fraud, inventory not available, etc.) and log who canceled. Cancellations should reflect in the status (Cancelled) and in reporting.

- **Product Catalog Management:** The OMS must include a **product catalog module** or integration, since all orders and inventory revolve around product data:

  - **Product Information:** Store key details for each product SKU: unique ID/SKU code, name, description, category, dimensions/weight (for shipping calculation), MSRP price, cost (for internal reference), etc. Also track if a product is active or discontinued.
  - **Variants:** If applicable, support product variants (e.g., size/color for apparel) which might have a parent product and variant-specific SKUs.
  - **Images/Media:** Optionally store links to product images or documentation (though heavy media might be just linked via URL if OMS isn’t user-facing storefront).
  - **Bulk Import/Export:** Allow admins to bulk import product data (CSV upload or via API from another system) to populate the catalog, as well as export for analysis.
  - **Catalog API:** Provide an API or mechanism to keep the product catalog synchronized with other systems (like an e-commerce storefront or ERP) if those are the master record. Define whether OMS is the master of product data or if it consumes product data from elsewhere (this will influence integration architecture).
  - **Kitting/Bundles:** If the business sells kits or bundles (multiple products sold as one), the OMS should support defining those relationships. For example, a “Gift Basket” product might consist of 5 underlying SKUs. The system should explode the bundle into its components for inventory reservation and fulfillment. This ensures each component’s stock is decremented. The OMS should manage this automatically when an order for a bundle is created.
  - **Subscription Products:** (Optional, for future) – If the system will handle subscriptions or recurring orders, catalog might need attributes to define subscription intervals, etc. This is advanced and possibly out-of-scope unless required by the business model.

- **Product Availability Rules:** The system should allow setting certain products as **available or restricted** in certain contexts. For example, maybe an item cannot be shipped internationally (hazardous materials) – that’s a rule that could be stored and validated when creating orders (e.g., if shipping country is not allowed for that item, block the order or warn). Similarly, some items might not be backorderable, etc. These kind of rules tie into both catalog and order processing.
- **Dispatch Management Dashboard:** Provide a dashboard for fulfillment teams that lists orders ready to be processed (filtered by status or warehouse). Users can easily see “Open Orders to Ship Today” and focus on those. From this dashboard, they should be able to take actions like print pick lists, mark as shipped, etc., without having to open each order individually. This improves throughput by guiding the workflow.
- **Integration with Warehouse Systems:** If the company uses a dedicated WMS or automation (like robots or conveyors), the OMS should integrate or at least export orders to those systems for processing. This could be via an API or file exchange (like sending orders to WMS and receiving status updates back). For the PRD, note that the OMS needs the flexibility to hook into external warehouse execution systems if needed, though it has basic capabilities on its own.

**Rationale:** Efficient order processing and dispatch are where the “rubber meets the road” – all prior steps lead to actually getting the product out the door. By providing tools for picking, packing, and label generation, the OMS significantly speeds up warehouse operations and reduces errors (like sending the wrong item). **Automation in order processing (like automated workflows for fulfillment) can save time and minimize errors**, ensuring a more efficient operation. Meanwhile, the product catalog is the foundation of the system; accurate product data is crucial for everything from taking orders (you can’t sell what isn’t in the system) to calculating shipping and reporting sales. A well-managed catalog within the OMS (or via integration) ensures consistency across channels and processes. Features like kitting or variant management reflect real-world selling practices that the system must handle to be viable across industries.

### 1.7 Sales History Tracking and Reporting

The OMS should maintain a thorough record of sales and make this accessible in various formats to users for analysis and customer service. While a dedicated section on **Reporting and Analytics** (section 7) will go deeper, here we cover the functional aspect of **capturing and viewing sales history**.

- **Order History Records:** Every completed order contributes to **sales history**. The OMS shall store all orders (with their details: items, quantities, prices, customer, dates, etc.) in a way that they can be queried later for history. There should be no automatic purge of orders from the main database unless per retention policy; instead, orders are archived after a certain time but still accessible as history.
- **Customer Purchase History:** On each customer’s profile (see 1.8 Customer DB), there should be a **chronological list of that customer’s orders** with key info (date, order number, amount, status). Customer-facing roles (sales, support) will use this to understand the customer’s interactions (e.g., “this customer orders often in Q4” or “the last order was 2 years ago”). This history is essential for personalized service.
- **Sales Dashboard:** Within the OMS UI, provide a **sales overview dashboard** showing recent orders and key metrics: e.g., total orders today, total revenue today, open orders pending, etc. This real-time snapshot helps managers track performance and detect any anomalies (like a sudden drop in orders or a spike in pending fulfillment).
- **Search and Filters:** Users (depending on permission) should be able to **search past orders** by various criteria: order ID, customer name, email, SKU, date range, status, etc. This is important for answering queries (e.g., “how many orders of SKU X did we ship last month?” or “find all orders for customer ACME Corp in 2024”). The system should provide a flexible search UI and possibly advanced filter options to narrow down results. Performance is key here (see non-functional requirements); even with thousands of orders, searches should return results quickly.
- **Export Sales History:** For offline analysis or integration, allow exporting order data (filtered or in bulk) to CSV/Excel. For example, an accountant might export all orders in a quarter to reconcile with financial records. Or a marketing analyst might export a customer’s order history to feed into a CRM. This should be permission-controlled (only certain roles can export large data sets).
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** The OMS should calculate and track some basic KPIs related to sales/orders, such as:

  - Total sales volume (value and number of orders) per day/week/month.
  - Average order value.
  - Repeat purchase rate (if customers are identified, how many orders per customer on average).
  - Fulfillment metrics: e.g., average time from order to ship.
  - These can be shown in reports or dashboards (overlap with Analytics section). The functional requirement is that the system captures needed data to compute these (which it will inherently by storing orders and timestamps).

- **Historical Data Retention:** Ensure the system can store years of sales data. This ties to data retention policies (section 8). Typically, keep at least 7-10 years of order history online (or easily accessible from archived storage) for trend analysis and compliance (tax records, etc.).
- **Period Closing (Optional):** Some businesses “close” months or quarters. While typically an accounting function, the OMS might support tagging orders to a financial period (especially if integrated to accounting). Not a must-have for MVP, but if in scope, ensure no changes happen to orders from a closed period (except returns with proper handling).

**Rationale:** Sales history is the lifeblood of planning and analysis. By capturing all orders and their details, the OMS builds a dataset that can be mined for insights into customer behavior, product popularity, seasonal trends, and more. Additionally, from an operational standpoint, having quick access to past orders helps resolve customer inquiries (e.g., re-sending an old invoice, checking what was last ordered) and supports sales strategies (targeting customers who haven’t ordered in a while, etc.). Since the question explicitly mentions “tracking and reporting,” this section ensures the functional capture, and section 7 will cover how we present and analyze it. In short, the OMS doesn’t just execute orders – it remembers them in detail, which adds long-term value for the business.

### 1.8 Customer Database Management

The system will include a **Customer Database** that stores information about customers placing orders. This is essential for repeated orders, customer-specific pricing, and providing personalized service. It may also serve as a lightweight CRM for the organization or integrate with an existing CRM.

- **Customer Profiles:** Each customer (individual or business) will have a profile in the OMS containing key information:

  - Name (and contact person if a business account).
  - Billing and Shipping addresses (support multiple addresses per customer).
  - Contact info: phone, email.
  - Customer type or segment (e.g., Retail customer, Wholesale client, VIP tier, etc.).
  - Perhaps a unique customer code or ID, especially if syncing with an external CRM/ERP.
  - Default preferences (e.g., preferred payment terms, default shipping method, tax exemption status if applicable).

- **Creating/Updating Customers:** Users (Sales agents, Support, Admin) shall be able to **create new customer records** and edit existing ones. For example, when entering a new order, they can search for an existing customer or create a new one on the fly if it’s a new buyer. Edits should be tracked via audit logs.
- **Linking Orders to Customers:** Every order in the system should be associated with a customer record (except possibly one-off “guest” orders if the business allows that concept, but even then a minimal record is often kept). This linkage populates the customer’s order history (as described in 1.7) and allows aggregate analysis per customer.
- **Company Accounts & Contacts:** For B2B scenarios, support **Company accounts** that can have multiple contacts or sub-accounts. For example, “ACME Corp” is a customer, and under that, you have multiple contact persons who place orders. The system should allow grouping these so that ACME’s total order history is consolidated, and possibly to set company-level terms (like “Net 30 payment terms” or special pricing contracts).
- **Customer Credit and Terms:** If applicable, store information like credit limit, current outstanding balance (if integrating with invoicing), and allowed payment terms (e.g., COD, Net 30). The OMS may not manage A/R itself, but it should at least know if an order is on hold due to credit issues – which would come via integration with finance perhaps.
- **Notes and Interaction Logs:** Allow recording **notes** on a customer profile, e.g., “Customer prefers delivery on weekends” or “Call before shipping large orders”. This helps customer support personalize service. If integrated with CRM, some of this might reside there, but the OMS having at least an internal note field is useful for quick context.
- **Customer Search:** Provide quick search for customers by name, email, phone, or customer ID. This is useful when creating orders or when support is looking up a customer who called in. It should be fast and user-friendly.
- **Data Privacy & Consent:** Given GDPR and similar laws, the system should have a way to mark a customer’s communication preferences (opt-in for marketing or not) and handle personal data rights (like deletion or export upon request) – see compliance section. The customer database design should accommodate these flags.
- **Duplicate Management:** Tools or processes to avoid or merge duplicate customer records. For example, if someone creates “Jon Smith” and another time “Jonathan Smith” with same address, an admin might merge them if identified as same person. At minimum, the system can warn if an email already exists, to prevent accidental duplicates.
- **Customer Portal (Future Consideration):** If someday a customer-facing portal is offered (not necessarily part of this internal system MVP), the customer records here would be the basis for login accounts. Keep that in mind in design (each profile might need a username/password or be linked to the auth system if that becomes a feature). For now, assume internal usage only unless stated.

**Rationale:** Managing customer data in the OMS allows for **better customer service and repeated business**. When all order history and preferences are tied to customer profiles, sales and support teams can quickly get context and build relationships (e.g., knowing a customer’s usual orders or their special requirements). It also reduces data entry – returning customers don’t need addresses retyped every time. **Customer management tools within an OMS enable personalized service and improved satisfaction**, as the system can help tailor interactions based on customer history. Additionally, a robust customer database is needed for any kind of sales analysis by customer segments, and it sets the stage for CRM integration (ensuring both systems share consistent customer info). In summary, the OMS will not treat orders in isolation but will construct a knowledge base of customers behind those orders, which is invaluable for strategic business growth.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

In addition to the functional capabilities described, the OMS must meet a variety of **non-functional requirements** – qualities and constraints that ensure the system is performant, secure, and maintainable. This section details expectations for **performance, scalability, security, availability, reliability**, and more.

### 2.1 Performance

The OMS should be optimized to provide a **fast and responsive experience** for users, even under heavy usage. Key performance requirements include:

- **Response Times:** Critical user interactions (loading an order, searching inventory, saving a new order) should typically complete in **under 2 seconds** for the end-user. For bulk operations or reports, some may take longer, but the UI should indicate processing and still aim for efficient completion. Page navigations should feel snappy to avoid user frustration in a high-paced environment like order entry or warehouse packing.
- **Throughput:** The system must handle a high volume of transactions, particularly during peak order times (e.g., holiday season sales). The OMS should be capable of processing **hundreds of orders per minute** without degradation, if the business demands (precise number depends on target scale, but design for peak loads like flash sales or major promotions).
- **Concurrency:** Support **dozens to hundreds of concurrent users** (sales agents, warehouse staff, etc.) performing actions simultaneously. Database locking or other contention issues should be minimized so that one user’s action (e.g., big inventory import) doesn’t stall others.
- **Batch Processing Windows:** If any large batch jobs are needed (like nightly data sync or report generation), they should be designed to run in off-peak hours or in a way that doesn’t significantly impact interactive users. If maintenance tasks (reindexing, backups) might slow things, schedule them appropriately.
- **Performance Testing:** As part of delivery, performance tests should be conducted to verify the system meets these criteria, with realistic data volumes (e.g., simulate having 1 million order records and ensure searches are still <2 sec via indexing, etc.). This ensures no nasty surprises in production.

### 2.2 Scalability

The SaaS OMS must **scale effectively** to accommodate business growth, both in terms of data volume and user load:

- **Horizontal Scaling:** The system should be designed such that application servers can be added to handle increased load (stateless app servers behind a load balancer, for example). As order volumes grow (or more clients/tenants are added, in a SaaS multi-tenant scenario), scaling out should be relatively straightforward.
- **Cloud-Native Scaling:** Leverage cloud infrastructure to auto-scale where possible. For instance, if hosted on a cloud platform, configure auto-scaling rules (CPU/memory thresholds) to add instances during peak and remove during idle times, ensuring cost efficiency and performance.
- **Database Scaling:** Use a database that can handle large data sets (orders, inventory records) and scale vertically or horizontally (through read replicas, partitioning, etc.). If multi-tenant, consider a sharding strategy by tenant if needed when scaling to many client organizations. The system should maintain performance even as data size grows to tens of millions of records.
- **Scalability of Features:** Each subsystem (inventory, order processing, etc.) should be stress-tested. E.g., inventory update logic should handle spikes (imagine a popular flash sale where hundreds of orders for the same SKU come in per second). The design might include an in-memory caching layer or queue to handle burst updates without overwhelming the DB.
- **Support Growth in Channels and Integrations:** As the business expands, they may integrate more sales channels or new warehouses. The architecture should allow adding new integration endpoints (e.g., a new marketplace API) without major refactoring, and new warehouses in config without code changes. **SaaS OMS are designed to scale with the business easily, accommodating increased volume and new operations without needing a re-haul.**
- **Multi-Tenancy (if SaaS offering):** If this OMS is offered as a SaaS product to multiple client companies, it must securely and efficiently handle multiple tenants. This includes scaling to many tenants, each with their own load. Partition data properly and ensure one heavy-use tenant doesn’t starve others (through resource isolation or fairness controls). Also allow scaling certain large tenants on separate resources if needed.

### 2.3 Security

Security is paramount given the sensitive data (customer info, orders, possibly payment data) an OMS handles. The system must protect against unauthorized access and data breaches:

- **Authentication & Authorization:** All users must authenticate (login) securely, ideally with support for strong authentication (password policies, two-factor authentication optional). Use industry-standard hashing for passwords. Authorization should be role-based (see section 3) and **enforced on every request** – users should only access data and actions they’re permitted to.
- **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data should be encrypted:

  - **In Transit:** Use HTTPS for all client-server communication. Any integration with external APIs should also use TLS. Internally, if using service calls, keep them secure as well.
  - **At Rest:** Encrypt sensitive fields in the database (like customer personal data, maybe addresses, and certainly any password or API keys stored for integrations). Full-disk encryption on database storage is recommended. If storing credit card tokens or the like, those need encryption and compliance (though ideally avoid storing raw card data at all).

- **PCI Compliance (Payment Security):** If the OMS touches payment information (card numbers), it must adhere to **PCI DSS** guidelines. Ideally, the design should tokenize credit cards via a payment gateway so that the system never stores full card numbers, reducing scope of PCI compliance. If any part of card data is handled, **ensure compliance with payment card security standards** – meaning regular security scans, minimal storage of data, etc.
- **Secure Data Access:** Implement **access control** at the data level as well, e.g., multi-tenant isolation (one client’s data can’t be seen by another’s users), and perhaps even record-level for certain roles (e.g., a sales agent might only see their own orders if that’s a rule). Use secure coding practices to prevent injection attacks – all queries should be parameterized, etc.
- **Audit and Monitoring:** Security logs should track authentication attempts, suspicious activities (like repeated failed logins), and admin actions. The system should ideally integrate with a monitoring tool that alerts on potential breaches or misuse (like an account downloading massive data unexpectedly).
- **Regular Backups and Secure Storage:** Data backups must be performed regularly and stored securely (encrypted). This ensures data can be restored after any incident. Also, backups should be protected with same rigor (no unauthorized access).
- **Vulnerability Management:** The platform should undergo periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. Any identified issues must be remediated promptly. Keep all frameworks and libraries up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Session Security:** Manage user sessions securely by using secure cookies, expiring sessions after inactivity, and protecting against session hijacking (via HTTPOnly and secure flags on cookies, possibly token-based auth for APIs).
- **Data Privacy Controls:** Where applicable, incorporate privacy-by-design. For instance, limit who can see personal data fields – maybe only customer support can see full customer contact details, while warehouse staff just see shipping label info. This principle of least privilege helps mitigate internal data misuse.
- **Physical Security:** If on cloud, rely on cloud provider’s physical security. If any on-prem component, ensure servers are in a secure environment.
- **Compliance Audits:** The SaaS provider should be prepared for security audits (like SOC 2, ISO 27001) which ensure that policies and procedures are in place for security and privacy. This may be a business decision beyond product requirements, but the product should support any controls needed for such certifications (e.g., comprehensive logging for SOC2 requirements).

### 2.4 Availability

The OMS should be **highly available**, as downtime can halt a business’s operations. Key points:

- **Uptime Target:** Aim for at least **99.9% uptime** (which is roughly < 8.8 hours of downtime per year). If targeting enterprise clients, possibly 99.99% for critical parts. This should be reflected in the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) if offered to customers.
- **Redundancy:** Avoid single points of failure. Deploy multiple instances of the application servers so that if one goes down, others continue serving. Use redundant database setup (primary-replica, with failover capabilities) or a distributed database that tolerates node failures. Similarly, multiple instances for any caching, message broker, etc.
- **Failover and Disaster Recovery:** In case the primary data center/region has a problem, have a disaster recovery strategy. For SaaS, this often means a secondary deployment in another region that can take over (with some data sync in place). RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) should be defined; e.g., RTO of 1 hour (system back up within an hour of major outage) and RPO of 15 minutes (at most 15 minutes of data loss). Achieving this might require replication of data to a secondary site near-real-time.
- **Maintenance Windows:** Plan maintenance such that it doesn’t impact availability if possible (e.g., zero-downtime deployments). If downtime is absolutely needed for major upgrades, schedule it in off-hours and notify users in advance, and try to keep it minimal. The system should ideally support rolling updates (deploy new version instance by instance).
- **Monitoring and Auto-Recovery:** Implement monitoring to detect any downtime or crashes immediately. Use health checks on services; if an app instance becomes unresponsive, the load balancer should pull it out of rotation. Automated processes (or on-call teams with runbooks) should restart or heal failed components quickly. For example, if the database fails over to a replica, the app should reconnect seamlessly to the new primary.
- **Graceful Degradation:** If certain non-critical components fail (like the reporting module or an external integration), the core order taking should still work. Design so that a partial outage doesn’t completely stop the system. For instance, if the shipping API is down, allow orders to be saved and maybe queue the shipping label request for later rather than failing the whole order process.
- **Capacity Planning:** Continuously track usage vs capacity. Before reaching capacity limits that could impact availability (like running out of DB connections or hitting max throughput on a server), plan upgrades or scale-out. This is more of an operational practice but driven by awareness from the system’s telemetry.

### 2.5 Reliability and Data Integrity

Beyond being “up”, the system must function correctly and ensure **data integrity**:

- **ACID Transactions:** The OMS should ensure that critical operations (like placing an order and updating inventory) are done in a transaction where either all succeed or none. This prevents data anomalies such as an order being recorded without inventory decrement or vice versa. The consistency of orders, inventory, payments, etc., is paramount.
- **Error Handling:** The system should handle errors gracefully and **never lose data**. If an external call fails (e.g., to a payment gateway or shipping service), catch the error and allow retry or alternate handling – do not just drop the operation. Log errors for later troubleshooting.
- **Idempotency:** Many operations (especially integrations via API or webhooks) should be idempotent where possible. For example, if a webhook to update an order status is received twice, the second one should not corrupt the data (just sees that status is already updated). Similarly, if a user accidentally clicks a button twice, avoid duplicate records by design.
- **Consistency Across Services:** In a microservice scenario (if applied), ensure that data eventually syncs across boundaries. If using eventual consistency, design it so that the user isn’t confused by interim states (and use compensation logic if needed).
- **Data Validation:** Implement strong validation rules to prevent bad data from entering the system (e.g., no order can have a negative quantity, inventory location must be recognized, emails must be valid format). This prevents many data integrity issues down the line.
- **Testing and QA:** Before release, the system should undergo thorough testing (unit, integration, user acceptance). In particular, test edge cases like high volumes, simultaneous actions (two users trying to allocate the last item of stock, etc.) to ensure the system logic holds up without creating inconsistency.
- **Robustness:** The system should be resilient to common issues like network flickers (retry logic on transient failures), timeouts, or partial outages of dependencies (as mentioned in availability). It should not crash or become unstable in unusual scenarios; at worst it should gracefully degrade or queue work for later.
- **Audit Trail Integrity:** Ensure that audit logs (see section 8.2) are themselves reliable and tamper-proof. If using them for compliance, they must accurately reflect what happened in the system.
- **No Data Loss on Failures:** In case of a crash or restart, use proper techniques (transaction logs, intermediate state saving) to avoid losing any transactions that were in-flight. For example, if an order is submitted and the server crashes just then, the system should have a way to confirm if the order was saved or not when it comes back up (perhaps using a message queue for writes, or a write-ahead log).
- **Concurrency and Race Conditions:** If two processes try to update the same order or inventory simultaneously (which will happen), ensure the final state is correct and no updates are lost. Use row locking or optimistic concurrency checks where appropriate. For instance, if two warehouse workers try to edit the same inventory count, one’s changes shouldn’t override the other unintentionally (the system should lock or warn or merge properly).

### 2.6 Maintainability and Extensibility

_(Not explicitly listed but usually considered)_ The system should be built in a way that it can be maintained and extended over time:

- **Modular Architecture:** Separate concerns so that new features can be added with minimal impact on existing ones. For example, the shipping integration can be a module that can be updated or swapped out without touching core order logic.
- **Clean Code and Documentation:** The codebase should be well-documented and follow coding standards, making it easier for future developers to understand and modify. Similarly, the system’s design should be documented (perhaps a living design doc outside this PRD).
- **Configuration over Custom Code:** Use configuration files or admin settings for things that might change (like adding a new order status or adjusting a rule threshold) instead of hard-coding, to avoid needing code changes for minor tweaks.
- **APIs and Integration Hooks:** Provide well-documented APIs for key functions so that external systems can be integrated easily. This also allows building new components (like a mobile app for the warehouse) without redoing logic. If partners or clients want custom extension, a good API (and possibly plugin system) facilitates that without compromising core.
- **Monitoring and Self-healing:** From a maintenance perspective, having robust monitoring (logs, metrics) helps maintain the system. Possibly include administrative UI for managing stuck processes (like retrying a failed message) rather than needing a developer.
- **Backward Compatibility:** When updating the system (especially if providing to external clients), aim for backward compatibility in APIs and data formats so that integrations don’t break with upgrades. Use versioning for APIs.
- **Testing for Maintainability:** Encourage a strong automated test suite, so that when code changes are made later, one can verify nothing major broke (regressions).

These non-functional requirements ensure that the OMS not only works correctly and efficiently at launch, but continues to perform reliably as the business and system grow, while keeping data secure and available.

---

## 3. User Roles and Permissions

The OMS will be used by different types of users within an organization, each having distinct responsibilities and levels of access. We define key **user roles** and their permissions to ensure the principle of least privilege – users only have access to the functions and data necessary for their job. The main roles envisioned are **Administrator, Sales Agent, Warehouse Operator,** and **Customer Support**. (Additional roles can be configured as needed, but these cover the primary user personas.)

### 3.1 Administrator (Admin)

**Description:** The Administrator has the broadest level of access. Typically product managers, system administrators, or IT managers would have this role. They oversee system configuration, master data management, and user management.

**Key Permissions & Capabilities:**

- **User Management:** Can create new user accounts, assign roles, reset passwords, and deactivate users. They manage who has access to the system and at what level.
- **Role & Permission Management:** Can create or modify roles and their permissions (if the system allows custom roles). For example, an Admin could adjust that Sales Agents can or cannot issue discounts above a certain percentage.
- **System Configuration:** Access to all global settings (e.g., adding a new warehouse location to the system, setting order numbering sequences, configuring integration credentials for APIs, turning features on/off, etc.).
- **Master Data Management:** Full access to manage product catalog (create/edit products, set pricing), manage inventory settings, and adjust stock levels if needed (though often that’s a warehouse job, admins could do emergency corrections).
- **View and Edit All Orders:** Can view, edit, or cancel any order in the system, regardless of who created it. This is useful for troubleshooting or assisting in any department’s tasks.
- **Override Capabilities:** Typically can override certain restrictions – for instance, force an order through an unusual workflow or edit an order that’s normally locked after a certain stage. These special powers help in resolving issues or testing.
- **Reporting:** Access to all reports and analytics, including administrative or audit reports (like login history, configuration change log).
- **Integration Management:** Can set up and test integrations (e.g., input API keys for shipping carriers, configure webhooks or data export to CRM). Admin serves as the technical owner of integrations.
- **Data Export/Import:** Allowed to perform bulk data imports or exports (e.g., load a bulk list of customers, export all orders). Because these can be sensitive or heavy operations, such actions are restricted to Admin.
- **Audit Trail Access:** Can view audit logs of system usage to monitor changes (who did what). For example, see who canceled an order or changed a product price.
- **Impersonation:** (Optional) Admin might have a feature to impersonate another user for troubleshooting (viewing the system as that user without needing their password). This helps in support scenarios.

**Notes:** Admins should be limited in number due to their wide powers. Multi-tenant SaaS might have an overall system admin (at provider) and tenant-specific admins. The system should log actions by admin especially carefully since they can change critical data.

### 3.2 Sales Agent

**Description:** The Sales Agent (or Sales Representative) role represents users who interact with customers to take orders or create quotes. They focus on the front-end of the order lifecycle, ensuring customers’ orders are captured accurately. They might be inside sales, field sales using the system, or even an e-commerce front-end could map to this role for permission purposes (though typically e-commerce orders go via integration).

**Key Permissions & Capabilities:**

- **Quote Management:** Can create new quotes for customers, modify their own quotes, and view quotes created by others in their sales team (depending on settings). They can apply discounts if within allowed range or request approval for larger discounts.
- **Order Entry:** Can convert quotes to orders or create new orders directly. They input customer info and items, select shipping preferences (often telling the customer the options), and confirm order placement.
- **Price Overrides (Limited):** If allowed by policy, they can override prices within a certain limit (e.g., give up to 10% discount without manager approval). This may require a specific permission toggle.
- **Hold/Release Orders (Limited):** Might be able to place an order on hold (e.g., if customer asks to delay shipment) and also release holds they placed. They likely cannot override a hold placed by fraud system or admin without escalation.
- **View Inventory Levels:** They need visibility into stock levels while talking to customers. A Sales Agent should be able to see current available inventory for products (across warehouses or specifically if the system chooses a warehouse, they just need to know “in stock / out of stock / backorder till date”). They likely **cannot** edit inventory, just view it.
- **Customer Management (Limited):** Can create new customer records for new clients and edit basic contact info for their customers (if a customer calls to update address, sales can do it). Possibly limited from deleting customers or merging, which might be admin tasks.
- **Order Editing:** Can make changes to orders they entered up until a certain fulfillment stage. For example, if an order hasn’t shipped, they can add an item if customer requests, or change a shipping method. These changes might trigger re-approval if there’s a significant effect (depending on business rules).
- **View Their Orders/Customers:** By default, they should see orders that they or their team have entered. Optionally, companies might let all sales agents see all orders (especially if they work as a pool). The permissions might be configurable: e.g., a salesperson can only see orders for the customers they manage (if each customer is assigned).
- **Sales Reports (Limited):** They can view reports related to sales performance, maybe only for themselves or their team. E.g., a Sales Agent could see how many orders and total sales they achieved in a period, but not necessarily the whole company’s figures (unless that’s open info or they are a sales manager).
- **CRM Integration Use:** If integrated with a CRM, Sales Agents might trigger sync of order info to CRM or vice versa (depending who enters customer data). Typically, a sales agent will ensure customer data is correct for CRM sync.
- **No Warehouse/Shipping Access:** They generally **cannot perform warehouse operations** like marking orders shipped or adjusting inventory. Their interface may allow them to check if an order has shipped (tracking info), but not alter it. They also typically cannot delete orders – cancellations should be done via a request or by specific role to avoid accidental revenue loss.

**Notes:** Sales Agents drive revenue by entering orders, so their interface should be optimized for fast entry and accurate info. Permissions should prevent them from meddling with things that could cause inventory errors or unapproved discounts. In some organizations, a _Sales Manager_ role might exist with slightly elevated permissions (like seeing all orders of their team, approving discounts, running broader reports). This could be an extension of the Sales Agent role or a separate role.

_(Reference: A sales rep’s main function is interacting with customers and ensuring orders are captured – as described, they provide product info and create orders.)_

### 3.3 Warehouse Operator

**Description:** The Warehouse Operator (could also be called Fulfillment Staff, Warehouse Manager, etc. depending on level) focuses on the back-end of order processing – managing inventory in the warehouse and fulfilling orders by picking, packing, and shipping. There might be a hierarchy (e.g., Warehouse Manager vs Clerk), but for permissions they’re similar with possibly some differences in inventory authority.

**Key Permissions & Capabilities:**

- **View Assigned Orders:** Can view all orders allocated to **their warehouse** that are in statuses requiring action (e.g., “Confirmed/Ready to Pick”). They should **not see orders for other warehouses** (for clarity and security) unless an admin or special cross-warehouse role.
- **Update Order Status (Fulfillment):** They can update the status of orders in their warehouse as they process them: mark as Picked, mark as Shipped (entering tracking info), etc. Essentially, they complete the fulfillment steps in the system.
- **Print Documents:** Allowed to print picking lists and packing slips for orders in their warehouse. They might have a batch print function.
- **Shipping Label Creation:** If the system is integrated with carriers, the warehouse role can request/print shipping labels (which involves accessing the carrier accounts configured by Admin). They thus indirectly use those integrations, but possibly cannot change carrier account settings.
- **Inventory Update (within warehouse):**

  - **Receiving Stock:** When new stock arrives at their warehouse, they can record a receiving transaction (increasing inventory). This might be linked to a purchase order or just a manual receive.
  - **Inventory Adjustments:** Warehouse staff may adjust inventory for their location (e.g., after a cycle count or if goods damaged). Depending on company policy, this might be restricted to a Warehouse Manager role versus any operator. But essentially, they have rights to increment/decrement stock and must provide reason codes.
  - **Transfer Stock:** If they send/receive stock to/from another warehouse, they perform those transactions.

- **Location Management:** If the system tracks bin locations inside a warehouse, they manage that (assign items to locations, update if moved). This can be an advanced detail; at least capturing that they handle physical arrangement data.
- **No Access to Sales Functions:** They typically do not create or edit orders in terms of adding items or changing customer info. They deal with orders once they are placed. They might have the ability to put an order on hold if a problem arises (e.g., can’t find the stock), which would alert someone in support/sales to resolve. Or they could add an internal note on the order.
- **Restricted Customer Data:** They likely don’t need full visibility of customer personal data beyond what’s needed for shipping (name, shipping address, phone for delivery). The UI could mask other info like billing details from them, for privacy.
- **Warehouse Reports:** They can run or view reports related to warehouse operations: e.g., pending orders, throughput (# of orders shipped per day), inventory reports (like stock on hand, low stock alerts for their warehouse).
- **Product Management (Limited):** They generally don’t create products, but they might update product info that’s relevant to warehousing, such as weight or dimensions if measured during receiving (if allowed). However, typically product catalog updates are for Admin or product managers, not warehouse, to avoid inconsistency.
- **Internal Communication:** They may use integrated collaboration tools (notes, @mentions) to communicate issues (like flag an order for customer support if address seems incorrect). This isn’t a permission per se, but part of how roles interact.

**Notes:** The Warehouse Operator role is about executing fulfillment. In some systems, there’s a distinction between a **Warehouse Manager** (who might also do more admin tasks like setting reordering thresholds, viewing all inventory globally, etc.) and a **Warehouse Clerk** (who just picks/packs). For simplicity, we group them, but further granularity can be configured. The main point is this role cannot do things like confirm payments or modify customer details – they work within the context of fulfillment.

_(Reference: The responsibilities outlined match those of warehouse and inventory managers, e.g., overseeing physical handling, managing stock availability. They also align with shipping coordination tasks, such as arranging shipments.)_

### 3.4 Customer Support

**Description:** The Customer Support (or Customer Service) role handles inquiries and issues from customers regarding orders. They need access to information to assist customers post-order, and the ability to make certain adjustments or initiate processes like returns. They serve as a bridge between the customer and internal operations.

**Key Permissions & Capabilities:**

- **View All Orders:** Customer support agents should be able to **look up any order** by various criteria (order number, customer name, email, etc.) since they may field calls/emails about any order. They need a broad view, not limited by region or who created it.
- **Order Status Updates:** They can view the full details and timeline of an order to answer questions like “Where is my order now?” or “When will it ship?”. They have visibility into tracking info, status, and notes on the order.
- **Modify Orders (Limited):** Support might need to make certain changes on behalf of the customer:

  - Change the shipping address **before** shipment (e.g., customer gave wrong address). They should be able to edit an order’s delivery address and notify the warehouse of the change.
  - Cancel an order (if the customer requests and it’s not shipped yet). Support should be allowed to cancel orders, which triggers the same logic as described before (restock inventory, refund payment if applicable). Notably, they should capture cancellation reasons for reporting.
  - Possibly add a note or special instruction to an order (if a customer calls in a request like “leave package at back door” – which might then be passed to carrier if possible).

- **Initiate Returns/RMAs:** Support should be empowered to create a return merchandise authorization. When a customer wants to return a product, support generates an RMA in the system, possibly even a return shipping label to send to the customer. They record which items, reason for return, and provide any instructions. This will alert the warehouse to expect a return and process refund accordingly. (This may tie into a returns module or integration with reverse logistics.)
- **Customer Account Assistance:** Support can create new customer accounts or update customer information if needed (similar to sales, but often support deals with existing customers). For example, if a customer says “please update my phone number on profile,” support can do that.
- **View Customer History:** For providing good service, support agents can view the **customer’s entire order history** and profile. This helps them see context (e.g., “I see you’ve ordered many times, thanks for being a loyal customer” or noticing if multiple past orders had issues).
- **Resend Communications:** Ability to resend an order confirmation or invoice to the customer. If a customer didn’t receive their email, support should click a button to resend it (or trigger an email with tracking info).
- **Issue Refunds/Credits:** If integrated with payment or if internal policy, support might trigger a refund process for returned/canceled orders. This could be via the OMS (if payment integration allows refund from the OMS UI) or at least mark that a refund is due and coordinate with finance. Permissions around financial actions may be limited to senior support or managers, depending on risk.
- **Escalation Tools:** Possibly flag an order for further review (like marking it as fraud-suspected if a customer call seems suspicious, which escalates to investigation team). Not a core function but helpful.
- **No Fulfillment Actions:** Support generally wouldn’t mark orders as shipped or edit inventory. They might coordinate with warehouse via notes or calls but not directly perform those operations in system (to keep clear separation and avoid mistakes).
- **Internal Only:** This role is internal. Customers themselves are not users of this system (unless a future portal as mentioned), so support’s job is to interface with the customer externally and the system internally.

**Notes:** Customer support’s broad read access ensures they can answer any question. Their write access is carefully scoped to customer-centric changes (addresses, cancellations, returns) and not things like changing product pricing or inventory. In some businesses, support might also take phone orders (overlap with sales role); if so, they might need Sales Agent permissions too, or a combined role. But here we consider support more for after-order care.

_(Reference: Customer representatives handle inquiries and order status updates, which is exactly the focus of this role.)_

### 3.5 Additional Roles and Considerations

_(Optional section for completeness)_

Beyond the four main roles above, the system might allow other specialized roles or subdivisions:

- **Finance/Accounting Role:** Access to financial info of orders (like totals, invoices) and capable of extracting data for reconciliation. They may not need to edit orders but want to mark which orders are invoiced/paid if that’s done externally.
- **Inventory Manager:** If separating from Warehouse operator, an Inventory Manager might oversee stock across all warehouses, set re-order points, and have permission to adjust inventory at any location. This is like a central planner role.
- **IT or Integration Role:** Could be allowed to configure integrations but not mess with orders, etc., though usually Admin handles that.
- **Customer (External):** As noted, typically customers do not log into an OMS (they would interface via a front-end e-commerce site or talk to an agent). If a customer portal were added, that would be a highly restricted role to only view their own orders and maybe create returns requests.

The system should allow assignment of multiple roles to one user if needed (role stacking) or creation of custom roles combining permissions. Each permission (like “edit order address” or “cancel order”) can be a toggle that roles have, for fine control.

**Permission Matrix (Summary):** _(This is a quick reference of what each main role can do)_

| Feature/Access                | Admin |    Sales Agent     |   Warehouse Op    |                 Support                 |

| Edit Order Line Items         |  ✅   |   ✅ (pre-ship)    |        🚫         | 🚫 (except through cancellation/return) |
| Cancel Order                  |  ✅   |  🚫 (or request)   |        🚫         |            ✅ (before ship)             |

| Update Order Status (fulfill) |  ✅   |         🚫         | ✅ (for their WH) |                   🚫                    |
| Generate Shipping Label       |  ✅   |         🚫         |        ✅         |                   🚫                    |

🚫 = not permitted; ✅ = permitted; “basic” means limited to creating/updating contact info; “their WH” indicates scope limited to their warehouse.

This matrix is just an illustration; actual permissions can be fine-tuned in the system’s roles configuration.

**Rationale:** Defining clear roles ensures a secure and efficient operation. Each user sees a UI tailored to their needs (simpler, with only relevant functions) which improves usability and reduces errors (a warehouse worker won’t accidentally change a price because that option isn’t even visible to them). It also protects sensitive information – for example, **customer support can handle inquiries without accessing internal configuration or financial data they don’t need**, and warehouse staff focus on logistics without seeing confidential sales info. These roles and permissions will also feed into the user stories in the next section, ensuring each feature is considered from the perspective of the intended user.

## 4. User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

To ensure the system meets user needs, we outline key **user stories** for major features, each with acceptance criteria. These stories are written from the perspective of the end users defined in the roles above and cover functional scenarios that the OMS must support. The acceptance criteria (AC) are conditions that must be satisfied for the story to be considered complete, effectively serving as test cases.

### 4.1 Sales Agent User Stories

**Story 1: Create Sales Quote** – _As a Sales Agent, I want to create a new sales **quote** for a customer with multiple products so that I can provide an estimate that can later be converted to an order._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The Sales Agent can start a new quote and select an existing customer or create a new customer on the fly for the quote.
- AC2: The system allows adding one or more products to the quote, specifying quantity for each. It should display the current price and calculate line totals and a quote total (including any tax/shipping if applicable at quote stage).
- AC3: The agent can apply a discount (percentage or flat) to a line or the whole quote, within their allowed limit. If the discount exceeds their authority, the system will flag it (either preventing or marking for approval).
- AC4: The quote can be saved as a draft with a unique Quote ID. Upon save, the quote appears in the system with status “Open Quote” and is associated with the customer and agent.
- AC5: The Sales Agent can print or email the quote to the customer directly from the system. The generated quote document should include quote validity date and terms.
- AC6: The quote information is stored and accessible later for editing or conversion. A timestamp of creation and last edit is recorded.

**Story 2: Convert Quote to Order** – _As a Sales Agent, I want to convert an accepted quote into an actual **sales order** so that the agreed terms with the customer are fulfilled._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: From an existing quote record, the Sales Agent can initiate a “Convert to Order” action. This action should be available only if the quote is in an acceptable status (e.g., not already converted or cancelled).
- AC2: Upon conversion, the system creates a new Order record copying all relevant details from the quote (customer, items, quantities, prices, discounts).
- AC3: The new Order gets a unique Order ID and an initial status (likely “Confirmed” or “Pending Payment” depending on payment flow). The order is linked back to the originating quote for reference.
- AC4: Inventory for the items on the order is allocated/reserved as per inventory rules. For example, available stock is reduced or reserved at this point.
- AC5: If the quote had multiple valid versions (revisions), the system uses the latest version for conversion and locks further editing on that quote.
- AC6: After conversion, the customer receives an order confirmation (if auto emails are set), and the quote is marked as converted/closed. The UI shows the order details immediately for review.
- AC7: The Sales Agent sees a confirmation message that the order is created successfully, including the Order ID, and the quote status updates to indicate it’s been processed.

**Story 3: Real-Time Inventory Check during Order** – _As a Sales Agent, I want to see real-time inventory availability of items while creating an order or quote so that I only promise products that are in stock._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: When the agent enters a product and quantity, the system immediately shows the current available stock for that product (either as a number or simply “In Stock” / “Low Stock” / “Out of Stock” indicator). This should reflect the most up-to-date inventory across relevant warehouses.
- AC2: If the requested quantity exceeds availability, the system warns the agent (e.g., “Only 3 available, you requested 5”). The agent can still save the quote/order but knows it’s backordered unless they adjust.
- AC3: The system might suggest the next availability date if known (e.g., if an incoming shipment is logged to arrive, it could say “Next restock expected on \[date]”). This could be future enhancement if integrated with procurement.
- AC4: If multi-warehouse, the system indicates from which warehouse it plans to source the items or if split (though at order entry, it might simply ensure availability somewhere). If a certain warehouse is tied to the customer, it checks that one first.
- AC5: The performance of inventory check is such that it doesn’t significantly slow down item entry (should be near-instant lookup from a cached store or fast query).
- AC6: The agent can override and place an order for out-of-stock items only if policy allows (backorder creation). If not allowed, the system should prevent adding that item or require admin override.

**Story 4: Select Shipping Option in Order** – _As a Sales Agent, I want to select the customer’s **shipping preference** (carrier and service) during order entry so that shipping cost and method are confirmed at order time._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The agent is presented with available shipping methods based on the customer’s shipping address and order weight/dimensions. For example, a dropdown or list of “Standard Ground - \$5.00, 2-Day Express - \$15.00, Overnight - \$25.00” etc., fetched via carriers or predefined rules.
- AC2: The system automatically calculates shipping cost for each method using integrated carrier rates or configured tables when the order items and address are known. These rates must consider total weight and possibly box dimensions if available.
- AC3: The agent can choose one of the options, and the chosen shipping cost is added to the order total. If the customer is eligible for free shipping (promotion or order total threshold), that option should be shown as well (e.g., “Standard - \$0.00 (Free)”).
- AC4: Insurance or special handling can be added: the agent ticks a box for insurance and the system updates the cost if applicable. The option for signature on delivery can also be selected if the customer requests.
- AC5: The chosen method is stored on the order, and later steps (warehouse) use this to generate the correct shipping label.
- AC6: If an agent tries to select an invalid combination (like overnight to a PO Box which the carrier may not support), the system should validate and warn or remove that option.
- AC7: The shipping choice and cost appear on the order confirmation that the customer receives.

**Story 5: Sales Order Adjustment (Pre-Shipment)** – _As a Sales Agent, I want to modify an order (change quantity or add/remove a product) before it ships so that I can accommodate a customer’s last-minute request._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The system allows editing an order that is in a status prior to fulfillment (e.g., “Confirmed” but not yet “In Fulfillment”/”Picked”). If the order has already been picked or shipped, the system disallows direct edits.
- AC2: The Sales Agent can add a new line item to the order, remove an item, or change the quantity of an existing item.
- AC3: Upon any change, the order totals, taxes, and shipping (if weight changed significantly or an item with free shipping promotion removed, etc.) are recalculated and updated.
- AC4: Inventory is re-checked: increasing quantity or adding an item triggers an availability check and reserves the extra stock. Removing an item frees that stock back to inventory.
- AC5: The system logs that an edit was made (who, when, and what changed) in the order history for audit.
- AC6: If payment was already captured for the original amount, the system either prevents change or indicates additional payment needed/refund due. (Depends on integration: might require cancel/recharge or a supplemental charge flow, which could be complex. At least, it should warn the agent to handle payment outside if needed.)
- AC7: The customer receives an updated confirmation if the order was changed, detailing the modifications (or at least updated totals).
- AC8: If the system requires approval for changes (maybe for large increases in value), it will mark the order as pending re-approval and notify an Admin/Manager.

### 4.2 Warehouse Operator User Stories

**Story 6: Pick and Ship Order** – _As a Warehouse Operator, I want to see the list of orders to fulfill and mark them as **shipped** after picking and packing so that inventory is updated and customers can be notified of shipment._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The warehouse user can view a **queue of orders** assigned to their warehouse that are in “Ready to Fulfill” status. Orders are sorted by priority (e.g., by promised ship date or FIFO).
- AC2: The user can select an order and view the pick list: each item with its quantity and location in the warehouse (if location info is present in system).
- AC3: The system allows the user to print the pick list or use a mobile device to tick off items as they pick. If using scanning, scanning an item will decrement the required quantity until all picked.
- AC4: If any item is not found or short, the user can mark a discrepancy (like “could only find 2 of 3, 1 missing”). This triggers a notification to inventory manager and possibly marks the order as exception or backorder needed.
- AC5: Once all items are picked and packed, the user proceeds to shipment. The system shows the package weight (calculated from item weights or entered manually) and allows selection of the carrier service (already chosen by customer, but possibly confirm packaging— e.g., if splitting into multiple boxes, they might adjust here).
- AC6: The user clicks “Generate Shipping Label” and the system connects to the carrier API to get a label and tracking number. The label is displayed/printable and the tracking number is saved to the order.
- AC7: The order status automatically updates to “Shipped” (or “Partially Shipped” if multiple packages and only one shipped) and a timestamp is recorded. Inventory of those items was already deducted at allocation, but if the system uses deduction at ship time, it happens now.
- AC8: The customer is marked for a shipment notification (email with tracking info).
- AC9: The warehouse queue no longer shows that order (or shows it under a completed section). The user can move on to the next order.

**Story 7: Receive Inventory** – _As a Warehouse Operator, I want to record incoming stock into the system so that inventory levels are updated accurately when new products arrive._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The user can navigate to a **Receive Inventory** function. They select or input a reference (like a PO number or shipment reference if available; can be optional for a quick receive).
- AC2: The user chooses the supplier or source of the stock (could be tied to a PO which has the list of items expected, or they manually add items to receive).
- AC3: The user then selects the product and quantity arriving. They can add multiple line items if several products are in the delivery. If using barcode scanning, they could scan each SKU and quantity gets incremented.
- AC4: For each item, they assign it to a storage location (if system tracks it) and can add details like batch number or expiry date if relevant.
- AC5: When done, the user submits the receipt. The system increases the on-hand inventory for that warehouse by the received quantities. Those items become available for allocation to orders.
- AC6: The system generates a record of the inventory receipt, with an ID, date, and who performed it. It should be viewable in inventory history reports.
- AC7: If a PO was associated, the PO is marked accordingly (items received, or partially received if not everything came). This may integrate with an ERP.
- AC8: If the user receives more than was expected or an item that wasn’t on a PO, the system warns and allows an override if permitted (admin might need to approve an unexpected receipt).
- AC9: If inventory tracking is bin-level, quantities are associated with the correct bins. If not, just the warehouse total is fine.

**Story 8: Inventory Adjustment (Cycle Count)** – _As a Warehouse Operator (or Inventory Manager), I want to adjust the inventory count of a product in my warehouse after a cycle count so that the system matches the physical stock._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The user can initiate an **Adjustment** for a specific product and warehouse location. The UI may present current recorded quantity.
- AC2: The user enters the new correct quantity or the amount of adjustment (e.g., +2 or -2). They must also select a **reason code** (e.g., “Cycle Count”, “Damaged goods”, “Theft/Shrinkage”, “Found extra stock”).
- AC3: The system will update the inventory immediately upon confirmation. For example, if it was 50 and user says set to 48, it now becomes 48.
- AC4: The adjustment is logged with who, when, old value, new value, and reason. This will appear in audit trails and possibly inventory reports.
- AC5: If an adjustment causes any allocations to be infeasible (e.g., you lowered stock below what’s reserved for open orders), the system should flag an alert to the inventory manager/admin. For instance, if 5 were reserved for an order but now only 3 exist, that order needs attention (backorder or transfer).
- AC6: The UI should restrict large adjustments maybe behind an extra confirmation or admin permission (depending on policy, maybe only a manager can adjust by large amounts or at all, whereas a regular operator can only submit a discrepancy report).
- AC7: If the system has multi-warehouse, ensure the adjustment is only for that specific warehouse’s stock and doesn’t affect others.
- AC8: Inventory valuation (if tracked) is updated accordingly if needed for financials (maybe out of scope for OMS, but at least quantity is updated).

**Story 9: Split Shipment** – _As a Warehouse Operator, I want to split an order into multiple shipments if not all items are available or they need to ship from different locations so that available items go out immediately and remaining follow later._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The system should allow splitting an order either at the time of allocation or during fulfillment. If an order is marked for split (automatically or manually), the warehouse operator will see that only certain items are assigned to their warehouse (if multi-warehouse scenario).
- AC2: If in a single warehouse scenario where one item is backordered, the operator can ship what’s available now. The interface might allow marking certain lines or quantities as shipping, leaving the rest pending.
- AC3: The user selects the items/quantities to include in the current shipment and proceeds to generate a shipping label for those. The system then marks those items as shipped in the order.
- AC4: The order status becomes “Partially Shipped”. The remaining items stay in “Confirmed/Pending” status and the system may automatically create a “sub-order” or a second shipment record to be fulfilled later.
- AC5: The customer should get a notification that part of their order is on the way, and the rest will follow (if the communication system allows such messaging).
- AC6: Inventory is properly decremented for the shipped part, and the remaining part is still reserved or will be fulfilled when in stock.
- AC7: When the remaining items become available, the order appears again in the queue to be picked as a new shipment.
- AC8: If the business prefers not to handle partials without approval, maybe an admin or support role triggers the actual split. But from warehouse perspective, they can complete what they have.
- AC9: The system must ensure no duplicate shipment of the same items – once marked shipped in one package, those cannot accidentally be shipped again in the second. The splitting process should adjust quantities accordingly.

### 4.3 Customer Support User Stories

**Story 10: Order Lookup by Customer** – _As a Customer Support agent, I want to quickly **look up a customer’s orders** when they inquire, so that I can give accurate information about their order status and history._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The support agent can search by various fields: customer name, email, phone, or order number. The search can be accessed easily from any page (like a global search bar).
- AC2: Typing a unique identifier (e.g., order number or email) should bring up the exact customer or order as the top result. Typing partial info shows a list of matching customers or orders.
- AC3: Selecting the customer will display the customer profile, including a list of recent orders (with status, date, amount) and possibly open issues/returns. Selecting an order will open the order detail view.
- AC4: The order detail view for support shows all relevant info: items, status timeline (ordered, shipped, etc.), tracking number and link, payment status, and any internal notes.
- AC5: The support agent can easily see if an order is delayed or has issues (e.g., a flag if it’s on hold or backordered) so they can proactively address it with the customer.
- AC6: The system ensures support can view all orders, regardless of who created them or what warehouse, to not hinder their assistance capabilities.
- AC7: This lookup should be fast (sub-second for results ideally) because a customer might be on the phone waiting for the answer.
- AC8: There’s an ability to filter or sort if needed (e.g., filter all open orders, or sort by date) when looking at a customer’s order list.

**Story 11: Update Shipping Address (Post-Order)** – _As a Customer Support agent, I want to update the shipping address on an order that has not yet shipped, so that I can correct customer address errors before delivery._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The support agent can retrieve the order as per Story 10. If the order is not yet shipped, an option “Edit Address” is available.
- AC2: Clicking “Edit Address” allows modifying the recipient name, street, city, state, zip, country, etc. The agent updates with the correct info provided by the customer.
- AC3: The system validates the new address (for correct format, possibly using an address validation API if available). If invalid, it flags errors for correction.
- AC4: Upon saving, the order’s record is updated with the new address. The change is logged (who changed, original address vs new).
- AC5: If a shipping label was already created (unlikely if not shipped yet, but maybe printed in advance), the system either voids that label or warns that a new label must be generated with the new address. The warehouse view should reflect the updated address clearly to avoid shipping to the wrong location.
- AC6: The customer could optionally get a confirmation that their address was updated (maybe an email). At minimum, support can verbally confirm to them.
- AC7: If the order was partially shipped (one package out, one pending), the address update should apply to pending items and ideally not affect the shipped package. Possibly disallow if partially shipped or handle carefully by splitting order addresses (not common, likely just disallow after any shipment).
- AC8: The support interface should clearly indicate success of the update, and maybe show the new address in the order summary to double-check.

**Story 12: Cancel Order on Request** – _As a Customer Support agent, I want to **cancel an order** (or remaining part of an order) upon customer’s request, so that they are not shipped and billed for an order they no longer want._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: Support can only cancel orders that are eligible (e.g., not yet shipped out of warehouse). If the order is already shipped, the system will not allow cancellation and may suggest a return process instead.
- AC2: The agent triggers cancellation via a “Cancel Order” button on the order screen. If only part of the order needs cancelling (like one item of a multi-line order), the UI should allow selecting items to cancel (or they can cancel entire order and re-create an adjusted one, depending on process simplicity).
- AC3: The system requires the agent to select a **cancellation reason** (like “Customer changed mind”, “Fraud suspected”, “Item discontinued”, etc.).
- AC4: Upon confirming, the order status changes to “Cancelled”. All remaining items in the order are released from fulfillment. Inventory that was reserved for this order is incremented back to available stock.
- AC5: If payment was already captured, the system should either automatically initiate a refund via the payment integration or mark the order as requiring refund. (Exact behavior depends on integration; acceptance could be: a notification is sent to finance or an automated refund success message is logged).
- AC6: A cancellation confirmation email is sent to the customer, listing which order (or items) were canceled and the refund amount (if any) expected.
- AC7: The canceled order should still remain in the database for record, with clear indication it was canceled and by whom. It should drop off any active fulfillment queues.
- AC8: Reporting should account for cancellations (i.e., that order not counted as open or completed sales). Not an immediate AC for the story, but an effect.
- AC9: If a cancellation fails (maybe because the warehouse just marked it shipped at the same time), the system should alert the agent that cancellation could not be completed and possibly advise next steps (like return process). Concurrency should be handled to avoid race conditions.

**Story 13: Initiate Return/RMA** – _As a Customer Support agent, I want to create a return authorization for an order, so that a customer can send back products and get a refund or replacement._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The support agent opens the order in question (which might be delivered or at least shipped). An option “Create Return” or “RMA” is available on shipped orders.
- AC2: The agent selects which items and quantities the customer is returning. For example, out of 3 items, maybe 1 item (or 1 of 2 units of an item) is being returned. The system only allows up to the quantity shipped to be returned.
- AC3: A reason for return is selected for each item or the whole return (e.g., “Defective”, “Didn’t like”, “Wrong item shipped”, etc.).
- AC4: The system generates an **RMA number** and a return record linked to the original order. The order might get a status update like “Return in Progress” or just maintain delivered status with linked return info.
- AC5: If configured, the system can generate a return shipping label (emailed to customer or available for download) using the reverse logistics account (could be same carrier in reverse). If not automated, support gives the customer instructions and maybe manually emails a label later.
- AC6: Inventory is not increased at this point (only upon actual receiving), but the return record is now awaiting the warehouse. Warehouse can see pending returns with RMAs.
- AC7: When the warehouse receives the return (they will mark it in system, likely a separate story or process – which might be done via a variant of receiving inventory but linked to RMA), the return record is updated to “Received” and triggers the next step: refund or replacement.
- AC8: The system should support either refund or exchange. If the process is refund, once items are marked received and inspected, the support or accounting triggers refund through payment system (or it happens automatically if configured: e.g., system might credit card via integration). If replacement/exchange, a new order might be generated for the replacement item (possibly at zero cost) or stock is sent out. This is complex but at least note that support can decide resolution type.
- AC9: The customer gets notifications: one with RMA details (like “please include this RMA number in your package”), and later a notification of refund processed or replacement shipped, as applicable.
- AC10: All this is logged. The order now shows a link to the RMA and its status, for easy reference if the customer calls again.

**Story 14: Provide Order Status Update** – _As a Customer Support agent, I want to give the customer an update on their order status when they inquire, so I need quick access to current tracking information._
_(This is somewhat covered by lookup, but to explicitly test status/tracking display)_
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: When viewing an order, the support agent can easily see the **status timeline** (e.g., “Order Confirmed on 5/1, Shipped on 5/2, In Transit, Expected by 5/5”).
- AC2: The system displays the tracking number(s) for shipped packages, and ideally the latest tracking status fetched from the carrier (e.g., “In transit: departed facility X”). This may be shown as “last update: \[date/time]”.
- AC3: If the system doesn’t auto-fetch, at least provide a one-click link “Track Package” that opens the carrier’s site with tracking number. The agent can use that info to update customer.
- AC4: For orders not yet shipped, the agent should see if it’s in process or if there’s any hold. If an order is delayed (e.g., waiting on stock), perhaps a note or status shows that so they can proactively explain the situation (“Item X is backordered until next week, hence the delay”).
- AC5: The agent can record that the customer called and requested an update, maybe by adding a note to the order (optional step for internal records).
- AC6: This information retrieval should be real-time. If the warehouse just shipped it minutes ago, refresh should show “Shipped” etc. The agent should trust the system for latest info, not need to email warehouse for an update.
- AC7: If a customer wants an update email or text, the agent can trigger a re-send of the shipping confirmation or a separate status email from the system. Possibly integration to a comms tool, but basically they have a way to easily communicate the status through the system, not just verbally.

### 4.4 Administrator User Stories

**Story 15: Configure New Warehouse** – _As an Administrator, I want to add a new warehouse location to the system so that inventory and orders can be managed for that location._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: In a system configuration section, the admin can choose “Add Warehouse”. They fill in details: Warehouse name, code, address (for shipping origin), maybe time zone, contact info.
- AC2: The system creates the new warehouse record. It is now available as a selectable location for inventory and order allocation.
- AC3: The admin can set initial settings for the warehouse, like which shipping carriers it uses (maybe if not all warehouses use all carriers), and any specific rules (like “this warehouse only fulfills region X” if such feature exists).
- AC4: The admin can assign users to this warehouse (e.g., mark which Warehouse Operators belong to it). This could be done by editing user roles and tying them to the warehouse.
- AC5: The system initializes inventory for new warehouse as empty. The admin (or inventory manager) can transfer or add stock to it via receipts or transfers.
- AC6: The new warehouse should not affect historical data of others – it’s just added going forward. Reports should now account for it in any multi-warehouse views.
- AC7: A confirmation is shown that warehouse is added successfully, and it appears in relevant dropdowns (like on product stock views, on user profile to assign, etc.).
- AC8: If any automated processes depend on list of warehouses (like nightly stock sync), those should include the new one automatically.

**Story 16: Set Up Shipping Carrier Integration** – _As an Administrator, I want to configure a shipping carrier’s API credentials in the system so that the OMS can fetch rates and print labels for that carrier._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The admin navigates to an “Integrations” or “Shipping Settings” area. They see a list of supported carriers (e.g., FedEx, UPS, DHL, USPS, etc.).
- AC2: The admin selects a carrier (say FedEx) and enters required credentials: e.g., API key, API secret, account number, meter number, etc., as provided by that carrier.
- AC3: There is a test function – the admin can click “Test Connection” which pings the carrier API (with maybe a simple request like rate for dummy data) to verify the credentials are correct. The system should show a success message or an error if credentials are wrong.
- AC4: Once saved, the carrier is marked as “Active” in the OMS. Users (sales or warehouse) will now have FedEx as an option for shipping, and the system will actively call FedEx for rates or label generation.
- AC5: The admin can also configure default services or packaging for this carrier if needed (e.g., default to FedEx Ground for standard shipping). Possibly also set a default pickup address (should use warehouse address typically).
- AC6: The admin repeats for other carriers as needed. Each can be individually tested and activated.
- AC7: The system should ensure that only authorized admins can see and edit these credentials (they are sensitive). Possibly mask the API keys when displaying after entry.
- AC8: If one day credentials need update (password change), admin can come back and edit the info.
- AC9: The integration config should propagate to all relevant parts of system immediately (no code deploy needed, this is configuration). So after saving, the very next rate request uses the new keys.

**Story 17: Define User Roles and Permissions** – _As an Administrator, I want to adjust the permissions of a role or create a new user role so that our internal processes are correctly reflected in what users can do._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The admin goes to a “User Roles & Permissions” setting area. They see the default roles (Admin, Sales Agent, etc.) and can select one to edit or choose to create a new role.
- AC2: When editing/creating a role, the admin is presented with a list of fine-grained permissions (like checkboxes for “Create Order”, “Cancel Order”, “Edit Inventory”, “View Financial Reports”, etc.). The admin can toggle these for the role.
- AC3: If editing a system default role, the system may warn if it’s a core role (to avoid accidental lockouts or major changes), but it should allow changes since business needs vary.
- AC4: The admin can name a new role (e.g., “Inventory Manager”) and select all permissions that role should have. They save it and new role is now available to assign to users.
- AC5: The system ensures that the admin cannot remove their own ability to manage roles (to prevent lockout). Also at least one admin should remain. Possibly block deleting the Admin role or removing all admins.
- AC6: Once roles are updated, any user currently assigned that role immediately gains/loses the changed permissions without needing to log out (though maybe some caching might require re-login; ideally immediate).
- AC7: The admin can test by impersonating or checking an audit of what a role can do. Possibly a “permission report” showing what each role can access after changes.
- AC8: The system logs that an admin changed role settings (who, when, what changes) for audit purposes (important for compliance).
- AC9: If there’s a conflict or dependency (like granting “Approve Discount” might require “Edit Order” permission), the system should handle that logic or inform the admin.

**Story 18: Run Sales Report** – _As an Administrator, I want to run a sales report for a given time period so that I can analyze performance and share metrics with stakeholders._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The admin goes to the **Reporting** section and selects a report, for example “Sales Summary Report”. They choose a date range (e.g., Jan 1 to Mar 31). They may also choose filters like by channel or region if available.
- AC2: They click “Generate” and the system produces the report. For a summary, maybe it shows total orders, total revenue, average order value, etc., in that range. It could also display a trend chart by week or month.
- AC3: The admin can then click “Download CSV” to get the raw data or summary data as needed.
- AC4: The results should match the data in system (the test is correctness). If any orders in that range were canceled or returned, ensure the report either excludes or notes them depending on definition (likely revenue net of returns).
- AC5: The report generation for a moderate range (3 months) should be quick (a few seconds at most). For very large ranges (multiple years), the system might pre-aggregate or indicate “this could take a while” or email when ready – but ideally interactive up to a reasonably large dataset.
- AC6: The admin finds the information needed (for instance: “Q1 Sales: \$500,000 from 1200 orders”). They can trust the report’s accuracy and present it.
- AC7: The UI should allow different formats – maybe toggle between table and chart views. Not mandatory, but many reporting modules have some visual.
- AC8: The system ensures only authorized roles can run this report (Admin or maybe Sales Manager). If a regular sales agent tried to access it, they wouldn’t see that option.
- AC9: Additional detail: The admin can drill down into the report if needed – e.g., click on a month to see breakdown by day or by product category, etc. That’s a nice-to-have showing that reports are interactive to some extent.

**Story 19: Audit Log Review** – _As an Administrator, I want to review the **audit log** of changes (e.g., order edits, permission changes) so that I can investigate any issues or ensure compliance._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: In an admin panel, there is an **Audit Log** section. The admin can filter logs by date range, by user, or by action type (e.g., show all “delete” actions or all changes on Order #1234).
- AC2: The admin enters a filter (like date yesterday and type “Order Cancelled”) and the system displays a list of log entries matching: e.g., “2025-05-04 14:23 – Order #1001 cancelled by user JohnDoe (reason: Customer changed mind)”.
- AC3: The log includes key details: timestamp, user, action, object (which record was affected), and possibly old vs new values if relevant (for data changes). For example, “Inventory SKU123 adjusted from 50 to 47 by WarehouseOp1 (reason: Cycle Count)”.
- AC4: The admin can export the logs shown if needed for compliance audit, or simply view them on screen.
- AC5: The system protects the integrity of these logs (they’re read-only and tamper-proof; no one except maybe system DB admins could alter, and that’s outside app scope).
- AC6: The logs should include security events like login attempts, password changes, etc., depending on scope (for security audit). But at least business events like orders, returns, data changes are logged.
- AC7: Performance: retrieving logs for a day or week is fine, but the admin should maybe not query huge spans without warning because logs could be large. If they do, maybe paginate results.
- AC8: The admin uses these logs to answer a question like “Who gave a 30% discount on Order #7890?” and can find that it was SalesAgent Mary on May 2 at 3pm, via the log entry of the price override.
- AC9: Only Admin (or a special Auditor role) can view these logs. Regular users have no access to them.

### 4.5 Reporting & Analytics User Stories

_(While the roles above cover many interactions, here are a couple specifically around analytics persona, could be admin or a manager.)_

**Story 20: Analyze Inventory Turnover** – _As an Inventory Manager (Admin role), I want to see a report of **inventory turnover** for each product so that I can identify slow-moving stock and make decisions about reordering or clearance._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The user goes to Reports and selects “Inventory Turnover” or similar. They might select a timeframe (past 12 months) and maybe filter by category or warehouse.
- AC2: The system calculates for each SKU: beginning stock, ending stock, and total units sold in that period, then computes turnover ratio or days on hand. The report lists products with these metrics.
- AC3: The user can sort the report by turnover (lowest first to see slow movers). E.g., “SKU123: 5 sold, average stock 100, turnover very low, 720 days on hand” etc., vs a fast seller “SKU789: 500 sold, avg stock 50, turnover high, 30 days on hand”.
- AC4: The report identifies items below a certain turnover threshold in red or flagged (“Slow moving stock”).
- AC5: The user can export this data or drill down (maybe click a SKU to see monthly sales and stock trend).
- AC6: The information helps them decide to maybe put SKU123 on clearance. The acceptance is satisfied if the report correctly captures sales history and stock levels – likely requiring integration of inventory and sales data.
- AC7: The calculations should match what an inventory accounting would show. If item was not sold at all, turnover is 0 or infinite days on hand, etc. System should handle dividing by zero gracefully (like if no sales, just mark as no turnover).
- AC8: The user has the ability to filter out products introduced mid-period or with incomplete data if needed (so as not to skew metrics). Could be a manual decision.
- AC9: The report runs within reasonable time (some precomputation may be needed given heavy data aggregation).

**Story 21: Track User Activity for Compliance** – _As a Compliance Officer (Admin role), I want to ensure the system usage meets compliance requirements (like GDPR) by tracking data export or deletion activities._
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: The system logs every time customer personal data is exported or deleted. The compliance officer can get a report of such actions. For example, “User Admin1 exported customer list on 2025-04-01” or “User Support2 deleted customer John Doe’s data under GDPR request on 2025-03-15”.
- AC2: If a customer invokes “right to be forgotten”, the admin process involves finding their data and deleting/anonymizing. The user story is that the compliance officer can verify this was done properly via logs or reports.
- AC3: The compliance officer can run a specific query (maybe via audit log interface or a dedicated report) for all actions of type “Export” or “Delete” over a period. They see who did it and for what data.
- AC4: The system enforces that only certain roles can do bulk exports or deletions (likely only Admin), so if something shows up, it was an authorized user. They just need to document it.
- AC5: The compliance officer also wants a guarantee that data retention rules are followed. Perhaps a scheduled job deletes old data (like purging personal data of orders older than X years for GDPR). They should be able to confirm such jobs ran and what they deleted. Possibly a log entry like “Auto-deleted 1000 order records older than 7 years (anonymized customer info) on 2025-05-01”.
- AC6: If audited by external auditors, the compliance officer can extract these logs from the system easily.
- AC7: The story is satisfied if the compliance-related actions are traceable and controlled. (This is a bit meta-user story but important for non-functional compliance turned into a functional check.)

These user stories collectively ensure that for each major feature described in the functional requirements, we have a user-centric scenario illustrating how it should work. The acceptance criteria serve as a guide for developers and testers to implement and verify the features. They also trace back to the requirements sections to ensure coverage (e.g., inventory check story for real-time inventory, shipping option story for shipping preferences, etc.).

## 5. System Architecture and Integration Points

This section provides a **high-level system architecture** overview for the SaaS OMS and outlines key **integration points** with external systems. The architecture is designed for scalability, maintainability, and the ability to interface with third-party services common in order management workflows (shipping carriers, payment gateways, CRM/ERP systems, etc.).

### 5.1 Overall Architecture Overview

**Architecture Style:** The OMS will follow a **modular, service-oriented architecture**. At a high level, it can be structured either as a monolithic application (all modules in one deployable) or as a set of microservices (independent services for orders, inventory, shipping, etc.) depending on scale needs. Given modern best practices and the need for scalability, a microservices or at least a well-layered architecture is preferred.

**Core Layers:**

- **Presentation Layer:** This includes the web UI (and any mobile or desktop interfaces) used by end-users (sales agents, warehouse staff, etc.). It could be a single-page web application (React/Angular) calling back-end APIs, or a server-rendered web app. The UI communicates exclusively over HTTPS with the backend services.
- **Application/Service Layer:** This contains the business logic, likely exposed via RESTful APIs (or GraphQL) to the front-end and external integrations. It might be broken into services:

  - _Order Service:_ Handles order creation, updates, status management.
  - _Inventory Service:_ Manages stock levels, reservations, adjustments.
  - _Shipping Service:_ Deals with shipping integrations and label generation.
  - _Customer Service:_ Manages customer data (or that could be part of an Account/CRM service).
  - _Catalog Service:_ Manages product info.
  - _Reporting/Analytics Service:_ Aggregates data for reports (or could be a separate pipeline to a data warehouse).

  Alternatively, some of these could be grouped in a single application but logically separated by modules or namespaces.

- **Data Layer:** Comprises the databases and storage solutions. Likely a **relational database** (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) for transactional data like orders, inventory, customers (ensuring ACID compliance for crucial transactions). Could be a single database with well-designed schema: tables for Orders, OrderLines, Products, InventoryLocations, Customers, etc. Or partitioned by service if microservices (with either separate schemas or databases).

  - For some use cases, a NoSQL store might be used (e.g., for a high-speed lookup cache of inventory or for logging events).
  - A search index (like Elasticsearch) might be introduced for fast searching on orders or products if needed to supplement the DB for complex queries.
  - Analytics might use a data warehouse or OLAP database if heavy analysis is needed separate from the transactional load.

- **Integration Layer:** This includes API clients, webhooks, and message queues used to interface with external systems:

  - e.g., an **API client for each shipping carrier** (FedEx, UPS, etc.), and maybe a generic interface so that adding a new carrier is not a huge code change – possibly using an integration service or third-party aggregator.
  - **Payment Gateway SDK/API** for processing payments (like Stripe, PayPal, etc.) if the OMS handles payments.
  - **CRM/ERP connectors:** e.g., connector to Salesforce or other CRM to sync customers and orders; connector to an ERP or finance system to sync invoices, payments, POs, etc.
  - A **message queue** (like RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, or Kafka) might be used for asynchronous processing – for example, to handle events like "order placed" -> send confirmation email, "order shipped" -> notify CRM or update analytics, without slowing the main transaction. Queues can decouple these tasks.
  - **Webhooks:** The system can expose webhooks for external systems to subscribe to (e.g., when an order ships, notify a storefront or when inventory low, notify a purchasing system).
  - **Internal API**: If microservices, they communicate via internal APIs or events. For example, when an order is created, the order service might call the inventory service API to reserve stock, or emit an event that inventory service listens to.

**Multi-Tenant SaaS Considerations:** If the product is offered to multiple client companies on one platform:

- The database will have a tenant identifier on all relevant data, or each tenant could have a separate schema or database. The architecture should enforce tenant isolation in data access.
- The application layer will incorporate tenant context to ensure users only see their company’s data.
- The scaling strategy may involve scaling horizontally as more tenants sign up (since combined load increases).
- Configuration might be multi-tenant aware (e.g., each tenant can have its own shipping carrier accounts configured, which influences integration calls at runtime).

**Technology Stack (Tentative):**

- Likely a web technology like Node.js/Express or Java (Spring Boot) or Python (Django/Flask) for the API layer. Or a combination if microservices specialized in different languages.
- Relational DB like PostgreSQL for core data.
- Redis or similar for caching (like session store or caching inventory counts for quick reads).
- Front-end in HTML5/JavaScript framework, accessible via browser on various devices.
- Containerization (Docker) and orchestrators (Kubernetes) for deployment to ensure portability and scaling ease.

The architecture is designed to be **API-first**, meaning all core operations are available through APIs which the UI uses. This makes integrations and future expansion (like a mobile app or partner systems) easier since they use the same APIs.

### 5.2 Key Components & Modules

Breaking down the system into key components/modules and their responsibilities:

- **Order Management Module:** Responsible for all order-related entities and logic.

  - _Entities:_ Orders, Order Line Items, Payments (or payment status), Shipments (or references to shipments module).
  - _Functions:_ Create/edit orders, manage order status transitions, handle order splitting/merging, coordinate with inventory allocation, trigger post-order events (emails, etc.), and manage order history records.
  - _Business Logic:_ Implement order validation rules, promotional logic (if any, or via integration), and ensure order completeness.

- **Inventory Management Module:** Handles inventory data and operations.

  - _Entities:_ Inventory records (by product and location), Transactions (receipts, adjustments, reservations).
  - _Functions:_ Update stock levels on events (order placed, order shipped, order canceled, return received), provide real-time stock queries, manage safety stock thresholds, generate low-stock alerts.
  - _Business Logic:_ Ensure inventory never goes negative inadvertently, enforce allocation rules (e.g., FEFO – first expiring first out, if per batch).

- **Product Catalog Module:** Maintains product information.

  - _Entities:_ Products, Variants, Categories.
  - _Functions:_ CRUD on products, maybe pricing management (if pricing not in separate pricing service), expose product info to order/inventory modules. Possibly integration with external catalog system if company has one.
  - _Business Logic:_ Ensure product data integrity (unique SKUs, required fields present), handle status (active/inactive items).

- **Customer Management Module:** Stores customer data (could also be considered part of a CRM integration).

  - _Entities:_ Customer accounts, addresses, contact log maybe.
  - _Functions:_ CRUD on customers, attach customers to orders, search customers.
  - _Business Logic:_ Prevent duplicate accounts, enforce required contact info (like email or phone), compliance with data privacy (consent flags).

- **Shipping Module:** Abstract layer for shipping functions.

  - _Entities:_ Shipments, which link to orders and have one or more packages with tracking.
  - _Functions:_ Rate calculation, label generation, tracking updates, shipping configuration (carrier accounts, shipping methods definitions).
  - _Integration:_ Connects to external Shipping APIs. Could use an existing shipping aggregator service as well (like EasyPost or ShipStation) to simplify integration, but that’s a business decision. If using such, the module just interfaces with that service’s API.
  - _Business Logic:_ Choose best carrier (if not fixed by user) based on cost/time, ensure label generation success/failure handling, store tracking securely.

- **Payment Module:** If the OMS is to handle payments (some OMS leave that to e-commerce or ERP, but if needed).

  - _Functions:_ Accept payment details or tokens from orders, call payment gateways to authorize/capture payments, handle refunds.
  - _Entities:_ Payment transactions records, with status (Pending, Authorized, Captured, Refunded).
  - _Integration:_ Gateways like Stripe, PayPal, Authorize.net etc. Or if just recording offline payments (like invoice, cash), record that status.
  - _Business Logic:_ Payment retries if failed, partial payments (deposits, etc.), store only tokens not raw card data for security (PCI compliance).

- **Reporting/Analytics Module:** May not be a real-time component but a separate one.

  - Possibly an ETL that copies data to a reporting database optimized for queries.
  - Provides pre-built reports and maybe a query interface. This could also be an integration with a BI tool.
  - If simple, might just be stored procedures or queries on the primary DB for now, but scalable solution would offload heavy reads.

- **Notification/Communication Module:** To handle sending emails or notifications.

  - _Functions:_ Template management for emails (order confirmation, shipment, etc.), and triggers to send these via SMTP or email service, possibly SMS integration for certain alerts.
  - Could also handle in-app notifications for users (like a bell icon with alerts – e.g., “5 orders delayed”).
  - Often implemented by sending events to a queue and a worker service sends emails so as not to slow main flow.

- **Authentication & Authorization Module:**

  - Likely an identity service for users. Could integrate with SSO if used by company (like Azure AD, etc.).
  - Manages user login, JWT token issuance, password resets, and enforces role-based permissions on endpoints. Could use frameworks or services (Auth0, etc.) for convenience.
  - Multi-tenant: user belongs to a company, so add that context to auth as well.

These modules interact in defined ways. For example, when an Order is placed:

1. Order Service receives request (with items, customer, etc.).
2. It calls Inventory Service (or module) to reserve inventory for those items. Inventory service checks and reduces available count.
3. Order Service saves the order in DB with status “Confirmed” (or “Allocated” as needed).
4. If immediate payment, Payment Module is invoked to process payment.
5. Order Service triggers Shipping module to generate shipment record or at least to prepare for label when ready (for now, maybe not until warehouse triggers).
6. Notification module is called to send confirmation email.
7. The Order is now visible to Warehouse through their interface (which calls Order Service with filter by warehouse allocation).
8. Warehouse picks and triggers Shipping module for label, which updates Order status via Order Service.
9. Inventory Service finalizes the deduction if it was only reserved until shipment.
10. Order status final update to Shipped, triggers email via Notification module, event to CRM, etc.

**Data Flow and Integration:** The architecture will likely use events or a central event bus to coordinate between modules for complex flows. For instance, an "OrderCreated" event might be published which the Inventory and Notification modules subscribe to. This decouples the services more than direct API calls. However, it introduces eventual consistency (which we manage by careful design).

### 5.3 External Integration Points

Integrations are crucial for an OMS to function in a larger ecosystem. Below are major integration categories and how the OMS will interact with them:

- **Shipping Carrier APIs:**

  - **Purpose:** Obtain shipping rates in real-time, purchase/print shipping labels, and track shipments. Possibly also schedule pickups if needed.
  - **Examples:** UPS XML/REST APIs, FedEx Web Services, USPS API, DHL API, etc.
  - **Integration Method:** Typically via REST or SOAP calls. The system will have stored credentials (per tenant or per installation). The Shipping Module will format requests (addresses, package weight/dims, service level) and parse responses (costs, label files, tracking numbers).
  - **Considerations:** Each carrier has its own request/response formats and service codes. It might be beneficial to use an abstraction library or service that normalizes them. Also, handle rate limiting and errors (like invalid address, or account issues) gracefully.
  - **Security:** Ensure the API keys are secure. Use encryption and do not expose them to front-end.
  - **Alternatives:** As noted, using an intermediary like **EasyPost** or **ShipEngine** that provides one API to multiple carriers can simplify integration at the cost of an extra dependency and possibly cost. This PRD doesn’t specify, but we can consider it if time to integrate multiple carriers is short.

- **Payment Gateways:** (if in scope)

  - **Purpose:** Charge customers for orders, handle authorizations, captures, and refunds.
  - **Examples:** Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, Authorize.net, Adyen, etc.
  - **Integration Method:** Usually through server-side API calls. The OMS might redirect or use a client-side component for payment, but since this is back-office oriented, a sales agent might take credit card over phone and enter it. Better to integrate via a **payment tokenization** approach (e.g., an iFrame or Stripe UI that returns a token, then OMS uses token to charge).
  - **Flow:** For an immediate payment, the Sales Agent enters payment details at order placement. The OMS sends to gateway, gets approval or decline. If approved, order marked Paid. If decline, notify agent to ask for another payment method.
  - **Security/Compliance:** Do not store CVV or full card data. Leverage tokenization and vaulted cards. Ensure **PCI compliance** by minimizing scope (maybe use hosted fields from gateway). If not handling payment, at least provide hooks to record payment status from another system.
  - **Refunds:** Support triggering refund requests to gateway on cancellations or returns. Log transaction IDs and statuses.

- **CRM Systems:**

  - **Purpose:** Align customer data and possibly order data with a customer relationship management tool used by sales/marketing.
  - **Examples:** Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho CRM, etc.
  - **Integration Approach:** Could be two-way. For example, when a new customer is created in OMS, push it to CRM. When an order is placed, optionally push an "Order" object or at least update the revenue/last purchase field in CRM for that customer.
  - Conversely, if sales leads or opportunities in CRM convert to orders, maybe CRM triggers creation of an order in OMS via API (less likely unless CRM has CPQ/ordering capabilities).
  - **Technical:** Many CRM provide REST APIs or webhooks. E.g., Salesforce via REST or using middleware like Mulesoft. Alternatively, use iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) like Zapier or Boomi for simpler mapping if coding is heavy.
  - **Data Mapping:** Decide what fields flow. Probably at least basic contact info and maybe a hyperlink from CRM record to OMS order or vice versa.
  - **Timing:** Could be near real-time (trigger on certain events) or batch (like nightly sync of any new customers).
  - **Scope:** If the business heavily uses CRM, integration can be deep (like promo campaigns in CRM trigger discounts in OMS, etc.). But minimally, ensure no duplicate customer info maintenance.

- **ERP/Accounting Systems:**

  - **Purpose:** Financial reconciliation, inventory procurement, invoicing, etc. Many companies have an ERP (like SAP, Oracle, NetSuite) or at least accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero).
  - **What to Integrate:**

    - Send completed orders (especially if on invoice terms) to ERP for invoicing and accounts receivable.
    - Send payments captured to accounting to record revenue.
    - Sync inventory levels or at least alerts for low stock to purchasing modules (ERP might generate POs).
    - Possibly get product catalog from ERP if that's the source of truth.

  - **Approach:** ERP integration can be complex. Could be direct DB integration, file exchange (CSV/XML), or API if modern. Sometimes done via EDI especially for larger trading partners.
  - **For PRD,** outline that the OMS should have the ability to import and export data relevant to ERP. E.g., daily export of all orders shipped with financial details, and import of product or inventory updates from ERP. Or real-time via APIs if feasible.
  - **Examples:** If integrating with NetSuite, might use their RESTlet APIs. For QuickBooks, they have APIs for invoices.
  - **Scoping:** Perhaps focus on the need, not the method: “The OMS will provide order data to the company’s accounting system to ensure financial records and inventory valuations are accurate.”

- **Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) and 3PLs:**

  - If a company uses a dedicated WMS or a third-party logistics provider, the OMS must communicate with those.
  - Could export orders to the WMS for picking and just get back status and tracking. Or if 3PL, OMS might send orders via EDI or API to 3PL’s system, and receive updates.
  - For initial scope, assume the OMS _is_ being used by warehouse directly (so WMS integration not needed). But we note that capability for future: e.g., “The system can send orders to an external WMS in real-time via API or file, and ingest shipment confirmations back.”

- **E-commerce Platforms / Marketplaces:**

  - Possibly the OMS will ingest orders from external sales channels (like a Shopify store, Amazon Marketplace, etc.).
  - If the OMS is multi-channel, integration to those channels is needed: e.g., connecting to Shopify API to pull orders as they come, and push back fulfillment info.
  - Also updating inventory on those channels (so they know current stock).
  - As SaaS targeting product managers, highlighting multi-channel is valuable. We might say: _Integration with e-commerce platforms (like Magento, Shopify) and online marketplaces (Amazon, eBay) to receive orders and update inventory across channels._
  - This can be done via direct API or using connectors/hubs.

- **Analytics/BI Tools:**

  - Maybe the company wants to plug data into a BI tool like Tableau or PowerBI. The OMS could provide a direct database connection or an API to feed such tools.
  - Or export to CSV which is then used. But a more robust approach: OMS populates a cloud data warehouse (like Snowflake or BigQuery) which BI reads. But that might be beyond initial scope. Still, mention that data can be accessed for analytics either through built-in reporting or via export to external tools.

**Integration Security & Reliability:**

- Use API keys/OAuth for authenticating to external APIs. Rotate keys if possible regularly (especially for sensitive ones).
- Implement retry logic for transient failures (e.g., if shipping API times out, try again a few times with backoff).
- Log all integration calls and responses (perhaps at least status, not full data for privacy) for troubleshooting (like a label failed to generate, admin can inspect why).
- Webhooks: verify signatures of incoming webhooks to ensure they’re from trusted sources (like some payment gateways send webhook on events, those should be validated).
- For long-running or unreliable connections, decouple via queues. E.g., place an “order to ERP” message in a queue and have a worker pick it and call ERP, so that the main thread for order placement doesn’t wait on ERP success (which might be slow or offline).
- Provide a way to reprocess failed integration events (like a dashboard showing "these 3 orders failed to export to ERP, click to retry").

### 5.4 Data Model Considerations

_(Though not explicitly requested, a brief note on data model helps architecture understanding)_

- The system will utilize a relational model. Key tables and relations:

  - **Orders** (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, Status, TotalAmount, etc.)
  - **OrderLineItems** (LineID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, UnitPrice, etc.)
  - **Shipments** (ShipmentID, OrderID, Carrier, TrackingNo, ShipDate, Status)
  - **Inventory** (InventoryID, ProductID, WarehouseID, QuantityOnHand, QuantityReserved, ReorderPoint, etc.)
  - **Products** (ProductID, SKU, Name, Description, Weight, Dimensions, CategoryID, Price, etc.)
  - **Warehouses** (WarehouseID, Name, Location details)
  - **Customers** (CustomerID, Name, Contact info, perhaps linked addresses table)
  - **UserAccounts** (UserID, Name, Email, Role, etc.)
  - **AuditLog** (LogID, Timestamp, UserID, ActionType, EntityType, EntityID, Details)
  - etc.

- Using proper foreign keys and constraints to maintain referential integrity (e.g., OrderLineItems tied to Orders and Products; if an order is canceled, etc., lines should reflect or be removed).
- For multi-tenant, either each table gets a TenantID, or separate schema approach (each client’s data separate).
- Indexing: heavy indexing on OrderDate, CustomerID, etc., for quick retrieval in search. Possibly full-text index for product search by name if needed.
- Consider partitioning large tables by date (like Orders per year) to keep queries fast as data grows.

### 5.5 Scalability & Deployment

- The system will be containerized and deployed on cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, or similar). Utilizing managed services like AWS RDS for database, and possibly Kubernetes for orchestration to manage microservices.
- **Load Balancing:** A load balancer will distribute requests among multiple application instances.
- **Stateless Services:** Wherever possible, services will be stateless to allow easy scaling. State (like session info) either stored in a centralized store (Redis) or use stateless JWT for sessions.
- **CDN for Static Content:** If the UI has static content (images, scripts), use a CDN to serve those for performance globally.
- **Global Deployment:** For a globally used SaaS, consider multi-region read replicas for DB and deploy app servers in multiple regions. But ensure single source of truth for writes (or per-tenant region if needed).
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment:** Set up CI/CD pipelines to test and deploy updates frequently. Canary or blue-green deployments to update with minimal downtime.

**Integration Example Flows:** (to illustrate in PRD how it all ties)

- _Order from E-commerce:_ An order is placed on Shopify. Immediately via webhook or scheduled job, that order data is sent to OMS through an API endpoint (/api/orders). The OMS creates the order as if a sales agent did, reserves inventory, etc. It then optionally sends back tracking info to Shopify once shipped.
- _Sync to CRM:_ After an order is completed, OMS calls CRM API to record the sale. Or daily batch exports orders to CRM.
- _Low Stock Alert to Email:_ When inventory goes below threshold, the OMS triggers an email (via notification module) to the purchasing team or creates a task in ERP to reorder.

**Reference to integration capabilities:**
The architecture ensures that **integration with other software (e-commerce platforms, accounting, CRM, etc.) is feasible and supported via APIs**. The system’s modular approach with clear APIs means it can fit into a company’s existing IT landscape without requiring all processes to happen inside the OMS.

In summary, the architecture is a robust cloud-based setup focusing on modular design, data integrity, and ease of integration. It leverages technology to ensure performance and reliability (using established patterns like load balancing, caching, transactions, etc.) and is flexible to incorporate new features or integration endpoints as the product evolves.

## 6. UX Considerations and Design Guidelines

While this document is not providing visual designs or mockups, it’s important to outline the **user experience (UX) principles and design guidelines** that will drive the OMS’s interface. Good UX is critical for user adoption, especially since the system will be used daily by different roles under time-sensitive conditions (e.g., entering orders quickly while a customer is on call, or picking items in a busy warehouse).

### 6.1 General Design Principles

- **User-Centric Design:** The interface should be designed around the needs and workflows of the end users. Understand that a sales agent’s needs (quick entry, customer info at fingertips) differ from a warehouse operator’s (clear pick lists, big text for item IDs, etc.). The design should reflect these contexts with tailored screens or at least modes for each role.
- **Clarity and Simplicity:** **Screens need to be simple and clear, showing only the necessary information** for the task at hand. Avoid clutter – for example, on the order entry screen, focus on customer and items fields, not advanced settings buried. Use progressive disclosure (show advanced or less-used options only when needed or in a secondary screen).
- **Consistency:** Establish a coherent design system (consistent colors, typography, button styles, form elements) across the application. This ensures that once a user learns one part of the system, that knowledge transfers to other parts. For instance, use consistent icons for actions like edit, delete, save; if green means “fulfilled” in one place, use the same color logic in legends elsewhere.
- **Responsiveness:** The application should be responsive to different screen sizes. Sales agents might use the system on a laptop or large monitor, whereas a warehouse worker might use a tablet or a mobile device attached to a cart. The design should adjust (a mobile-friendly design for certain screens, like using a single column layout on small screens).
- **Speed and Feedback:** Users should get immediate feedback on actions. If saving an order takes a second, show a loading indicator or disable the save button briefly so they know it’s processing. If an operation succeeds, show a confirmation (“Order #123 created successfully”). If it fails, display a clear error with guidance (e.g., “Failed to save because XYZ – please try again or contact admin”). This builds trust that the system is doing something and the user isn’t left wondering.
- **Accessibility:** Follow accessibility guidelines (like WCAG) to ensure the application can be used by people with disabilities. This includes proper contrasts for text, support for screen readers (ARIA labels), and keyboard navigability (some power users prefer keyboard over mouse). For example, a sales agent might tab through form fields quickly or use shortcuts.
- **Localization:** If the product will be used in multiple regions, design with localization in mind. That means text should be externalized for translation, UI can handle longer words (some languages take more space), and date/number formats adapt. Even if initial target is one locale, being prepared is good.
- **Error Prevention:** Guide users to avoid errors. Use dropdowns or pickers instead of free-text where possible (to avoid typos in state codes, etc.). If a field is required, mark it clearly and maybe prevent moving forward until filled (but not in a way that frustrates – highlight politely). Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (like “Are you sure you want to cancel this order?”) help avoid accidental clicks.
- **Shortcuts for Efficiency:** Frequent users appreciate efficiency features: e.g., keyboard shortcuts for saving or adding a line item, ability to scan barcodes in a field that auto-finds a product, etc. Think about adding those once the basic UI is working, as enhancements.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Use visual hierarchy to draw attention to the most important information. For example, on an order detail page, the order status and customer name might be in a larger or bold font at top, whereas individual less critical fields (internal notes or tags) might be smaller or lower on page. On a dashboard, highlight key numbers (like total orders today) in large cards.

### 6.2 Role-Specific UX Considerations

- **Sales Agent UX:**

  - Should have a **quick order creation workflow**. Ideally one screen or wizard where they enter customer info, then add items, then confirm. Minimize navigation. Possibly allow searching for products by name or SKU quickly (auto-suggest dropdown). **Data entry should be quick, with options to scan barcodes or upload files for bulk orders** – maybe scanning is more for warehouse, but if a sales agent in a store scanning items a customer wants, it could apply.
  - Provide **real-time feedback**: as they add an item, show stock and price; as they fill an address, maybe auto-complete address based on postal code.
  - **Guided Selling**: Could have features like product recommendations or upsell suggestions (nice-to-have) – e.g., when adding a product, show related items or accessories to suggest to customer. This can enhance sales.
  - **Customer context**: If the agent selects an existing customer, show a sidebar or popup of that customer’s last order or any notes (“This customer has a VIP status” or “Owes payment on last order”) to give context.
  - **Keyboard usability**: Many inside sales might be fast typists – allow adding items by keyboard only (e.g., type SKU, press enter, type qty, press enter to add, etc. without mouse).
  - Use **tabbed interface or sections** if needed to separate quote vs order or additional info like payment. But ensure common path is streamlined.

- **Warehouse Operator UX:**

  - Likely working in a physically active environment. They might use tablets or industrial devices.
  - Use **large, easy-to-read text** for critical info like item SKU, location, quantity to pick. High contrast for visibility in a warehouse.
  - Possibly a **dark theme** option if devices are used in bright environments (some find dark background with light text easier in dim warehouses, or vice versa in bright).
  - **Barcode scanning integration:** If scanning items for picking or receiving, ensure the cursor focus flows automatically (like after scanning an item, jump to quantity, then next expected item, etc.). Or provide a dedicated “scan mode” UI that just lists scanned items vs expected.
  - For packing, maybe allow printing documents right from a tablet or device (integrate with network printer).
  - **Offline capability:** if the warehouse has patchy Wi-Fi, consider the app behavior – maybe allow continuing to scan offline and sync when back online (could be complex, maybe not initial but consider).
  - On a **dashboard** for warehouse, highlight tasks: e.g., “You have 5 orders to ship and 2 returns to process”. Provide clear call-to-action buttons to start each task.
  - Keep navigation minimal: a few big buttons for main tasks (Process Orders, Receive Stock, Inventory Adjust).

- **Customer Support UX:**

  - Emphasize **search and visibility**. A support dashboard might just be a big search bar and recent cases. They should get to an order or customer in as few clicks as possible.
  - On customer or order view, show all relevant info in one place or one screen if possible – they don’t want to hunt in menus while the customer waits.
  - Possibly provide a **timeline view** on an order (like a vertical timeline “Ordered -> Picked -> Shipped -> Delivered” with dates).
  - If multiple channels of orders exist, unify the view (the support shouldn’t have to know if it was a Shopify order or a manual order – all should look similar aside from a tag maybe).
  - Provide convenient actions like “Resend email” or “Issue refund” as buttons on the order page so they can do it during call easily.
  - Possibly integrate a helpdesk system or at least copy order info easily if they need to send in email; but beyond scope likely.

- **Admin UX:**

  - Admin area can be more form-driven and less frequently used, so it's okay if some things are not as streamlined as sales (which is used 100 times a day). But still design nicely.
  - Organize settings into logical groups: Users/Roles, Integrations, System Settings, etc. and use clear subpages.
  - Provide confirmation for critical changes (like “Are you sure you want to delete this user?”).
  - Possibly provide helpful defaults and validation in forms (like when adding a user, auto-generate a password or require a strong one).
  - For viewing logs or reports, allow export or filtering easily since admin might then need to share that info.

### 6.3 Navigation and Layout

- Use a consistent navigation scheme, likely a sidebar or top menu. Perhaps:

  - A top/side menu with main sections: **Dashboard, Orders, Inventory, Customers, Reports, Settings** (just as an example).
  - The menu should respect permissions: e.g., Warehouse role might only see Orders (fulfillment view) and Inventory, not Customers or Settings.
  - Use icons+text in menu for quick recognition.

- **Dashboard:** Likely the landing page after login. This could be role-specific.

  - For Sales: show sales KPIs, recent orders, maybe a shortcut to create new order.
  - For Warehouse: show number of pending orders to fulfill, maybe a picking performance stat, and alerts for low stock.
  - For Support: show number of open returns or escalations, and quick search bar.
  - For Admin: overall system health (if applicable), maybe user activities, and a summary of orders/inventory.
  - Customizable widgets if ambitious, but at least tailored content per role.

- **Forms and Tables:** A lot of OMS screens are forms (entry forms) or tables (lists of orders, lists of products).

  - Design forms with clear labels and inputs, grouping related fields (like address fields together). Mark required fields with \*.
  - Tables should be sortable, filterable if the dataset is large (orders list should allow filter by status, date, etc.). Provide pagination or infinite scroll for large lists.
  - Possibly allow customizing columns (some users might want to see different info).

- **Color and Visual Cues:** Use color coding for statuses (but also use an icon or text for accessibility beyond color).

  - E.g., New orders highlighted in blue, shipped in green, delayed in orange, canceled in gray/red.
  - Inventory levels: could highlight low stock items in the interface in red.
  - But ensure not to overdo color to where it distracts.

- **Branding:** If this is a SaaS product for sale, include some branding (logo, consistent color palette). If it will be client-specific, maybe allow a client logo in their instance.
- **Design Inspiration:** The design can take cues from modern admin dashboards (like clean flat design, cards for different info sections). There are many templates out there for admin panels which provide a baseline look and feel that users find familiar.

### 6.4 UX for Efficiency and Accuracy

- **Dashboard Quick Actions:** For common tasks, provide direct links or buttons. For example, on the dashboard: "New Order" button, "Receive Stock" button for warehouse, etc.
- **Autocomplete & Search:** Implement autocomplete for fields like product search (when adding item to order) and customer search. This saves time and avoids errors in typing IDs.
- **Undo Feature:** If possible, allow an undo for certain actions within a short window (e.g., if someone accidentally cancels an order, an admin might undo it within 5 minutes if not actually processed). This is a safety net. If not technically feasible for all, at least for things like removing an item from an order before save, maybe have an undo remove.
- **Tooltips and Help:** Use tooltips for any non-obvious field or button. For instance, an info icon next to "Insurance" option that on hover says "Covers the value of the item in case of loss or damage during shipping."
- Possibly have a help section or guided tour on first use to train new users.
- **Multi-step vs Single-step:** Some flows like order entry could be single-page forms (which might be fine for experienced users). Others might benefit from multi-step wizard (like a step-by-step for new users). Perhaps allow both or pick the one that best suits typical scenario. Possibly a compact form with an optional step-by-step mode toggled by a "Guided mode" toggle.

### 6.5 Example Interface Sketches (in descriptive terms)

- **Order List View:** A page with a filter panel on top (filter by status, date range, customer), and a table of orders with columns: Order #, Date, Customer, Amount, Status, and maybe action buttons (view/edit). Each row might be clickable to view details. Possibly highlight if an order is aging (like not shipped after X days).
- **Order Detail Page:**

  - Top section: Order #, status dropdown (if user can change it manually), customer info (with maybe a link to customer profile).
  - Middle section: List of items (table with product, quantity, price, line total).
  - Side section (or bottom): totals summary (subtotal, tax, shipping, total paid/outstanding).
  - Below: timeline of status, and sections for shipping info (address, method, tracking if shipped), billing info, and internal notes.
  - Buttons: "Edit", "Cancel Order", "Create Return", "Print Packing Slip", etc., depending on user role (some disabled/shown only if allowed).

- **Inventory Management Screen:**

  - Possibly a grid or list of products with columns for stock at each warehouse. E.g., SKU, Name, Warehouse A stock, Warehouse B stock, etc., low stock flag.
  - Clicking a product or warehouse opens details: maybe a graph of stock over time, list of recent transactions (receipts, shipments).
  - Buttons to Adjust inventory or Transfer stock could be present for those with permission.

- **Receiving UI:**

  - A form or scanning interface. Could list POs to select or just a blank form where user scans/enters items one by one. Each scan adds an entry to a list with count, user can confirm and finalize.

- **User Management UI (Admin):**

  - List of users with name, email, role, active/inactive.
  - Edit user with toggles for roles, maybe multi-select if multiple roles can be assigned.
  - Create user form with optional send invite email.

- **Reports UI:**

  - List of available reports. Choosing one brings up criteria selection and then either show in browser or download.
  - If showing in browser, maybe some charts or tables. If heavy, maybe just prompt download.

Overall, the UX should aim to **reduce cognitive load**, meaning each screen is straightforward about what the user needs to do and presents info in a digestible way. Use whitespace wisely, group related items, and label things clearly (avoid internal jargon on UI labels; use terms users know like “Customer” instead of “Account” if that’s more common to them, etc.).

Given that this is a product targeted to enterprises (product managers will likely get feedback from actual end-users as well), it might not need to be flashy but it must be **intuitive and reliable**. A good UX will significantly reduce training costs and errors; for instance, by focusing on ease-of-use, one ensures that **the screens are fast and user-friendly, with key info at a glance on dashboards and reports.**

Finally, we should involve actual users in refining the UX (usability testing) once wireframes or prototypes exist – but that’s beyond PRD scope. The PRD just emphasizes that design is a priority and provides guiding principles to the design/UI team.

## 7. Reporting and Analytics Capabilities

An effective OMS not only processes orders but also provides insights into the data it handles. This section covers the **reporting and analytics features** of the system – what kind of reports are needed, how data can be analyzed, and how users access these insights.

### 7.1 Standard Reports

The system will come with a suite of **standard, pre-built reports** addressing common informational needs:

- **Sales Reports:**

  - _Sales Summary_ – total orders and revenue over a period (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually). Option to group by order date or fulfillment date.
  - _Sales by Product_ – which products are selling the most (quantities and revenue). Identify top sellers vs slow movers.
  - _Sales by Channel_ – if multi-channel, break down orders from each source (e.g., direct sales vs online vs marketplaces).
  - _Sales by Customer_ – who are the top customers by revenue, or list of all customers with their purchase totals (could help identify VIPs).
  - _Geographical Sales_ – sales distribution by region/state/country (based on shipping addresses).

- **Order Reports:**

  - _Open Orders_ – list of all orders that are not yet completed (pending or in process), possibly with aging info (how long they’ve been open).
  - _Fulfillment Performance_ – e.g., average time from order to ship, percentage of orders shipped within 24 hours, etc. This can help identify if operational SLAs are met.
  - _Backorder Report_ – all orders/items that are backordered (customer ordered but awaiting stock) including the due dates if known.
  - _Returns Report_ – list of RMAs/returns, reasons, and their status (pending vs completed), and the financial impact (e.g., value of returned items).

- **Inventory Reports:**

  - _Stock On Hand_ – current inventory levels for all products by warehouse. (Often used as a reference sheet or for auditing.)
  - _Low Stock Items_ – products below their reorder point or with stock under a specified threshold, to alert purchasing.
  - _Inventory Valuation_ – if cost info is in system, a report of total inventory value by product (quantity \* cost) by location, which is useful for accounting.
  - _Inventory Transactions_ – log of inventory movements (received, adjusted, allocated, shipped) in a period, possibly filtered by SKU or warehouse.

- **Customer Reports:**

  - _Customer List_ – all customers with their contact info, and maybe last order date, total orders count.
  - _Customer Order History_ – for a selected customer, their orders list (this could be done via search in UI as well, but a formal report could allow exporting a customer's history).
  - _Customer Segmentation_ – if the system tracks customer categories or loyalty, a report grouping by those (e.g., sales from Retail vs Wholesale customers).

- **Financial Reports (if needed):**

  - _Payment Reconciliation_ – orders and their payment status, to reconcile with payment gateway or accounting.
  - _Sales Tax Report_ – total tax collected by jurisdiction (for tax filing purposes). Might need if system calculates tax.
  - (Note: If an ERP handles accounting, the OMS might not need full financial statements, but providing these can be helpful for quick checks or for smaller businesses using the system standalone.)

- **Operational Alerts Reports:**

  - _Audit Trail Report_ – might not be for everyday use, but admin could run a report of “All changes made by user X” or “All order edits in last week” for compliance.
  - _Error/Exception Report_ – e.g., orders that failed to export to ERP or shipments that failed label generation, so that admin can fix them (this is more of a system health but can be delivered as report or admin dashboard).

Each standard report should have **parameters** (date ranges, filters like specific product or customer or warehouse) that the user can adjust, and then run/generate the report on demand.

### 7.2 Reporting Interface

- **In-App Viewing:** Many reports can be viewed directly in the application UI. They could be presented as tables, possibly with summary sections or charts for visual insight. For example, a sales summary could include a line chart of sales over time, and key figures like total orders, total revenue, average order size.
- **Exporting:** All reports should have an option to export the data, typically as CSV or Excel, so that users can do additional analysis beyond what the system offers (or import into other systems). **No citations needed here** – but it’s a common requirement. For large reports, if generation is slow, the system might generate asynchronously and notify when ready to download.
- **Scheduling Reports:** A useful feature (could be phase 2) is to allow certain reports to be scheduled and emailed to specific recipients. For example, email the daily sales report to the sales manager every morning. While not mandatory for MVP, it is a valuable addition for a SaaS offering to keep users engaged via email and reduce manual tasks.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Aside from static reports, the system could have interactive dashboards (especially for quick analytics):

  - E.g., a dashboard that shows current KPIs like today’s orders count and revenue, maybe a chart of sales this week vs last week.
  - Perhaps a dashboard for inventory that shows how many items are low stock, or for support showing number of returns in process.
  - These dashboards are essentially real-time (or daily refreshed) mini-reports always visible on the home screen.
  - An admin might be able to configure which widgets appear for which role’s dashboard.

### 7.3 Ad-hoc Query / Custom Reports

While standard reports cover common needs, users might have unique questions. There are a few ways to support ad-hoc analysis:

- **Custom Report Builder:** A more advanced feature (maybe later phase) where users can choose fields and filters to generate their own report. For instance, choose fields from Order and Customer (like customer city and order total) to see sales by city, which may not be a pre-built report. This is complex but adds flexibility.
- **Data Export / API Access:** If a user has strong analysis needs, they might simply export data (like all orders of last year) and pivot in Excel or use an external BI tool.

  - Possibly provide an **API for data** so a company’s BI system can pull data automatically. E.g., an API endpoint for orders that can retrieve in JSON or CSV. If security is a concern, ensure API tokens and maybe read-only scope for such.
  - For SaaS, maybe offering a direct integration to common BI (like a connector to Tableau or Google Data Studio) could be a selling point.

### 7.4 Data Visualization and Insights

- **Trends and Patterns:** The system should help identify trends. For example, increasing order volume month-on-month (growth trends) or seasonal spikes. A line chart in the sales report can make these obvious.
- **Drill-down:** When viewing aggregated data, users should be able to drill down to details. E.g., from monthly sales totals to the list of orders in a specific month, then click an order to see its detail. This connected navigation makes the data actionable.
- **KPIs and Benchmarks:** The product team might identify key metrics to always highlight. For instance:

  - Order fill rate (what % of orders are fulfilled without going to backorder).
  - On-time shipping rate (if orders have a promised ship date vs actual).
  - Return rate (% of orders that have returns).
  - Customer lifetime value (requires multiple orders per customer, which we have).
  - These can be shown in management-oriented reports.

- **Comparative Analytics:** Possibly include year-over-year or period-over-period comparisons in reports (like this quarter vs same quarter last year).
- **Use of Analytics for Product Improvement:** The analytics could feed back into system rules: e.g., if analytics show certain items often run out, one might adjust reorder points (which is a manual decision but driven by report).
- **Embedded Analytics Tech:** If building charts is out of scope to custom develop, the product could embed an existing library or tool (like Chart.js for graphs, or a lightweight BI embedded solution). But likely custom-coded basic charts suffice for MVP.

### 7.5 Big Data and Machine Learning (Future scope)

While not in initial requirements explicitly, a forward-looking mention:

- The data gathered by the OMS could enable machine learning use cases:

  - Demand forecasting (predicting future sales of products to help inventory planning).
  - Customer segmentation and behavior prediction (who is likely to churn or make repeat purchases).
  - Anomaly detection (flag if an order looks fraudulent or if an operational metric deviates strongly).

- These are beyond basic PRD needs but it’s something product managers might have in roadmap to differentiate the product eventually (like "AI-driven insights").
- Possibly mention: _In the future, the analytics module could incorporate predictive analytics, such as forecasting inventory needs or identifying trends using AI, to further assist decision-making._

For the scope of this document, the key is that **robust reporting and analytics are built-in, giving stakeholders actionable insights from the OMS data.** By providing both high-level dashboards and detailed reports, the system ensures that users can not only operate the business in real-time but also continuously improve it through data-driven decisions.

### 7.6 Data Retention in Reporting

Connect with compliance: reports should respect data retention rules (if customer data must be purged after X years, old reports shouldn’t expose that data beyond what’s allowed). Likely not an issue if purge also removes it from DB that reports draw from. But if an archive is kept for reporting beyond retention of detail, ensure it's aggregated or anonymized. This is a minor point but to note that reporting doesn’t bypass compliance.

**Examples of Use Cases:**

- A sales manager uses the Sales by Product report to decide which products to promote or which to discontinue due to low sales.
- A warehouse manager runs the Low Stock report every Monday to decide what to reorder that week.
- Customer support manager looks at the Returns report to see if a particular product has a high return rate (maybe quality issue).
- The CEO glances at the dashboard for a quick health check: “We did \$X in sales today and shipped Y orders, with no major backlog – business is on track.”

**Technical Note:** For performance, if reports over a large dataset are slow, employing a separate reporting DB or using database summary tables (materialized views) would be considered. For now, design assuming moderate data; later optimize with appropriate tech.

In conclusion, the reporting and analytics capabilities ensure the OMS is not just a transactional system but also an **insight platform**, empowering users at all levels to make informed decisions and keep improving operations.

## 8. Data Retention, Audit Trails, and Compliance

In an era of strict data regulations and security concerns, the OMS must enforce proper **data retention policies, maintain comprehensive audit trails**, and adhere to compliance standards like GDPR. This section details how the system will handle data over its lifecycle, keep logs for accountability, and ensure legal and regulatory compliance.

### 8.1 Data Retention Policies

**Retention Requirements:** The system stores various types of data (orders, customer info, inventory transactions, etc.). We must define how long each type of data is retained in the system’s active database and what happens afterward:

- **Order Data:** Typically, businesses keep order history for a long time (years) for customer service, warranty, and analytic reasons. However, personal data within orders might be subject to privacy laws. A common practice is:

  - Keep full order records (including customer personal data) for a set period (e.g., 7-10 years is common for financial records, depending on local law and company policy).
  - After that, archive or anonymize older orders. Archival could mean moving to a separate database or exporting to cold storage (like CSV to an archive server or data warehouse).
  - **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** As an alternative to deletion, we can strip personal identifiers from old records while keeping aggregate info. For example, replace customer name and contact in orders older than X years with tokens or remove them, but keep the order items and amounts for statistical analysis.
  - The retention period might vary by region if different laws apply (e.g., EU might require deletion on request sooner).

- **Customer Data:** Under laws like GDPR, customers have the right to request deletion of their data (right to be forgotten). The OMS should allow an admin to delete or anonymize a customer record on request:

  - This would remove personal identifiable info (name, email, address) from their profile and possibly from their orders (e.g., replace with "Deleted Customer" and blank out address fields), while retaining the order for records.
  - Alternatively, a deletion might remove the link to customer entirely (so orders remain but are marked as guest or anonymized).
  - We also need to consider if there's any data that cannot be deleted due to legal obligations (like invoice records might need to be kept for tax). Usually, companies justify keeping minimal data for those needs.

- **Inventory and Operational Data:** Inventory logs, etc., have less personal info but could be voluminous. They can likely be kept for a long time unless they clutter the system. Possibly archive warehouse transaction logs after a couple of years, since real need diminishes once inventory has turned over.
- **Audit Logs:** These can grow quickly. We might decide to keep detailed logs (who changed what) for a certain time (maybe 1-2 years for active debugging/compliance) and then archive. However, some industries require keeping audit logs for many years if it's a regulated system. It's better to allow exporting and cleaning out older logs if needed, or archiving them to a file store.
- **Backups:** Define how long backups are kept as well. For example, daily backups for last 30 days stored on secure storage, monthly backups for a year, then older purged. This is more an IT policy, but relevant for retention (and if someone asks for deletion, the backups might still have data until they age out).
- **Configuration Data:** (like user accounts) – likely keep as long as the account is active. When an account is deleted, remove personal info but maybe keep a placeholder for historical references (like audit logs could say "User ID 1234 (deleted)" did something).

**Automated Enforcement:** The system should have a scheduler or admin-triggered process to enforce these policies:

- e.g., a job that runs monthly to find any data past retention date and purge or anonymize it. This should be careful to not break referential integrity (like if deleting customers, ensure orders either are deleted too or anonymized).
- Provide settings in the admin interface to configure retention periods for certain data types to meet different jurisdictions or company policies.
- Document clearly what the default policy is and allow override.

**Backup and Recovery:** Although not exactly retention, mention that we do have backups (for disaster recovery) and those adhere to retention as well (we won't keep backups indefinitely, and they are securely stored).

### 8.2 Audit Trails and Logging

**Audit Trail Purpose:** The OMS will maintain an **audit trail** to record critical activities and changes in the system, which is essential for accountability, troubleshooting, and compliance.

Key aspects:

- **User Activities Logged:** Any creation, modification, or deletion of records should be logged. For instance:

  - Order events: Order created, order edited (with which fields changed), order canceled, return created.
  - Inventory events: Stock adjustments, receipts, transfers.
  - Master data changes: Product added/edited, pricing changes, customer info changes.
  - Permission changes: user roles changed, new user created or removed.
  - Essentially, any action that alters data or system configuration is a candidate for logging.

- **Content of Logs:** Each log entry should include:

  - Timestamp.
  - User who performed it (ID and name if possible).
  - Action type and object (e.g., “UPDATED Order #1001”).
  - Before and after values for changed data (if it’s a data change).
  - If an automated system job did something (like auto-cancel backorder after X time), mark the actor as system.
  - If relevant, the IP address or device (for security events).

- **Viewing Audit Logs:** As described in user stories, admins or authorized roles will be able to view these logs through the interface (with filters) or export them for audit. Possibly have separate categories: security log (logins, etc.), data change log, etc., to sift easily.
- \*\*Protection### 8.2 Audit Trails and Logging (continued)
- **Protection of Logs:** Audit logs should be **immutable or tamper-evident**. Normal users (and even most admins) cannot modify or delete log entries. Ideally, logs are stored in a secure, append-only manner (such as a separate logging service or write-once database). This ensures trustworthiness of the audit trail for compliance audits.
- **Security Event Logging:** In addition to data changes, security-related events are logged. This includes user login attempts (successful and failed), password changes, permission changes, and integration access (e.g., if an API key is used to fetch data via an external integration). These logs help detect unauthorized attempts or misuse.
- **Audit Log Retention:** Determine how long audit logs are kept. For high-security environments, logs might be kept for a long period (e.g., 1-2 years active, then archived). The system could allow exporting and purging older logs if needed to manage size (after ensuring compliance needs are met). An **audit log report** can be provided for compliance officers to review user activities over a period (as covered in Reports and User Stories).
- **Usage Monitoring:** Optionally, the OMS could have a monitoring dashboard for admins to see recent critical actions (e.g., a feed like “User X canceled Order Y at 3:45pm”). This improves transparency within the organization for oversight.

By maintaining detailed audit trails, the OMS supports **accountability and compliance**, ensuring that any critical change in the system can be traced to a user and time. This not only helps in forensic analysis (e.g., investigating erroneous inventory adjustments) but also is often required for quality certifications and regulatory compliance audits.

### 8.3 Regulatory Compliance (GDPR and Others)

The OMS will be designed in alignment with key **data protection and industry regulations** to ensure legal compliance in all operational regions:

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** – For any personal data of EU citizens stored (customer names, addresses, emails, etc.), the system will:

  - Obtain and record consent where applicable (if, for example, marketing communications are sent, the OMS or integrated CRM must have a record of opt-in).
  - Enable **Right to Access**: Admins can retrieve all personal data related to a specific individual to respond to a GDPR data access request. This might be facilitated by a “Export Personal Data” function that compiles customer profile and their orders, etc.
  - Enable **Right to Erasure**: As discussed, the OMS allows deletion/anonymization of a customer’s personal data on request. The system will remove personal identifiers while preserving transactional records. A mechanism to anonymize data in bulk for multiple records (if a business leaves the service, etc.) will be considered.
  - **Data Minimization & Purpose Limitation:** Only necessary personal data fields are stored (e.g., we store a customer’s billing/shipping info for fulfilling orders, but we might not store sensitive info like national ID or birthday unless needed). We do not collect data that is not needed for order management.
  - **Data Localization:** If required, the system can be deployed in specific regions to keep EU data within EU, etc. (This is more on deployment side, but the software should allow configuration such that a tenant’s data is stored in a chosen region to comply with data residency laws.)

- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)** – Similar to GDPR, provide California residents the right to request their data or deletion. The features built for GDPR (access and delete) will cover CCPA needs as well. Also, ensure we don’t sell personal data (not applicable, as OMS isn’t about selling data).
- **PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)** – If the OMS deals with credit card data, it will adhere to PCI requirements:

  - Preferably, **no raw card data is stored on OMS servers**. Use tokenization via payment gateways. If any data like last 4 digits or card type is stored (for reference), that’s not sensitive. Any process that handles payment data will be encrypted and secured.
  - Regular security scans and possibly PCI compliance audits will be done on the system.
  - If the OMS provides an interface for entering card details, it will use secure iframes or hosted fields from the payment gateway so that the OMS backend never sees the full card info, reducing PCI scope.

- **SOC 2 and ISO 27001** – As a SaaS product, the provider will aim to comply with industry standards for security and data management. This means:

  - Implementing controls for security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, and privacy as outlined in SOC 2. Many of these controls manifest in features already discussed (access controls, audit logs, backup/disaster recovery, etc.).
  - Possibly undergoing regular audits to certify compliance. While not directly features, the product’s design (audit logs, permission systems, etc.) facilitates passing such audits. For example, **strong access control and encryption measures** in the product align with SOC2 requirements for protecting customer data.

- **GDPR/Data Protection Impact Assessment:** If needed, the product team can conduct a DPIA to ensure all risks to personal data are mitigated. The product’s features (like consent tracking, minimal retention) are outcomes of such an analysis.
- **Industry-Specific Regulations:**

  - If the OMS is used in specific industries, it should be flexible to comply with those. For example, if used in healthcare for managing medical supply orders, it may need to consider HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) for any patient data – though likely the OMS doesn’t handle patient info, just products and addresses. Still, encryption and access control make it easier to comply if needed.
  - In e-commerce, there are **consumer protection laws** (like honoring returns within certain days, etc.) – the OMS provides features (returns module, order timestamps) that help the business comply with those obligations.
  - **Tax compliance:** The system’s reporting of taxes collected can assist with VAT/GST filings. If needed, integration with tax calculation services (like Avalara) can ensure correct tax rates by jurisdiction.

- **Audit and Compliance Reporting:** The system can generate logs and reports that help demonstrate compliance. For example, an admin could export a report of all data deletion requests completed in a period to show regulators if asked (this ties in with audit logs and reporting).
- **User Training and Awareness:** While not a software feature, the product documentation will highlight best practices (like regularly reviewing user access, using strong passwords, etc.). The system can enforce some (like password policy), but also provide guidance for others (maybe tooltips in admin panel about “Ensure you have consent before adding customer data”).

In summary, the OMS is built with compliance in mind, **adhering to data protection laws and security standards** to reduce legal risks and ensure smooth operation across regions. By providing the necessary tools for data control (retention settings, deletion, logs) and implementing strong security measures (encryption, access controls), the product allows client companies to use it confidently within the bounds of their regulatory requirements. Compliance is not a one-time feature but an ongoing commitment – the product team will stay updated on relevant laws (e.g., new privacy laws in other countries) and update the system as needed to remain compliant.

## 9. Roadmap, Feature Prioritization, and Dependencies

This section outlines a high-level **product roadmap** for the OMS, indicating the priority of features, their groupings into phases (e.g., MVP vs later enhancements), and important dependencies between features. This helps in planning development and managing stakeholder expectations about what will be delivered first.

### 9.1 Phase 1 – Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Goal:** Deliver a functional OMS covering core order management and inventory capabilities that provides immediate value. Focus on features that form the essential workflow “Order is placed -> Order is fulfilled -> Inventory is updated -> Basic tracking and records are available.”

**Key Features in Phase 1 (Must-Haves):**

- **Order Creation & Basic Lifecycle:** Ability to create quotes and convert to orders, or enter orders directly. Manage order statuses from creation to shipment (basic statuses: New, Confirmed, Shipped, Delivered, Canceled). Ensure partial fulfillment is possible, but advanced return handling can be minimal at this stage.
- **Product Catalog & Inventory Tracking (Single Warehouse):** Implement product management (CRUD for products) and real-time inventory updates for one default warehouse. This includes stock level decrement on order and increment on manual adjustment or cancellation. Multi-warehouse support can wait for Phase 2; MVP can assume one inventory location to simplify initial release.
- **Basic Shipping & Tracking:** Integrate with at least one major carrier (e.g., UPS or FedEx) to generate shipping labels and tracking numbers. Perhaps focus on domestic shipping first. The shipping preferences UI is implemented (carrier service selection, cost calculation for that one carrier). We may not include complex shipping rules or insurance in MVP, just basic label generation for a chosen method. Alternatively, if integration is complex, MVP could have a placeholder to record tracking numbers manually with plan to automate in next phase – but automated label printing is a strong selling point, so one carrier integration is worth including.
- **Customer Database:** Implement customer accounts and attach to orders. MVP requires storing customer info with orders but might skip fancy features like segmentation. Ensure we can create new customers and search existing ones when placing orders.
- **User Roles & Security:** Set up the user authentication system and the four primary roles (Admin, Sales, Warehouse, Support) with appropriate access controls in the UI. Focus on ensuring no unauthorized access (sales can’t see admin settings, etc.). Some fine-grained permission editing could be left for later if needed; MVP can have roles hard-coded as defined for now.
- **Basic Reporting/Dashboard:** Provide a simple dashboard with key info (e.g., number of orders today, pending shipments, maybe a small list of recent orders) and a couple of essential reports: Open Orders report and Sales Summary report. These cover operational visibility and a high-level performance view. Detailed or custom reports can be later.
- **Audit Logging (Critical Events):** Log crucial actions like order creation, edits, and deletions. A full audit UI can be rudimentary (even raw logs accessible to admins) in MVP, but the data capture should start Day 1 for compliance. Perhaps provide an export log function for now, and a nicer UI later.
- **Non-Functional Baseline:** Ensure the MVP meets basic NFRs: the app is reasonably responsive with expected MVP load, secure (HTTPS, basic encryption of sensitive fields, simple password policy), and stable (no crashes in core flow). Also set up automated backups and a failover strategy for the database from the get-go, as those are hard to retrofit. The uptime SLA can be 99.9% with manual failover if needed in MVP, and later improve automation.

**Dependencies & Notes for Phase 1:**

- Product Catalog must be in place before orders (dependency: can’t create order without products). So development-wise, implement product and inventory model first.
- Customer management is needed before or alongside order entry (to attach customers to orders). However, if necessary, MVP could allow a “guest checkout” style where orders can be placed with just typed-in customer info without a saved account; but since sales agents use it, better to have a customer entity.
- Inventory updates depend on order status changes (e.g., decrement on order confirm), so that integration between order module and inventory module is a core piece to develop carefully.
- Shipping integration in MVP depends on having order and address info flow to a label request. So after order and inventory flows are working, integrate shipping. If delays happen, a contingency is to allow manual entry of tracking for MVP and push carrier API to next phase, but that reduces value. Aim to have at least one carrier working to demonstrate end-to-end automation.
- The role/permission system should ideally be done early because it affects how UI is built (which menus to show, etc.). But it’s also somewhat independent – one can build features with an admin user, then add role restrictions around them. For MVP, at least implement the roles as static definitions.
- Payment Processing in MVP: This PRD didn’t explicitly list payment gateways in core features (except under integration). If needed (like if this OMS is directly taking payments for orders), we might include at least a basic integration (e.g., process credit card via Stripe) in MVP. If the OMS will often be used with external e-commerce that already handles payment, we might postpone building payment integration and simply allow recording external payment references. We should clarify in planning. For completeness, if MVP includes payment:

  - Dependence on selecting a gateway and using their API library. Could restrict to one gateway at first (e.g., Stripe).
  - If not included, ensure the order has a field to mark payment status (paid/unpaid) so that if used standalone, they can at least track that manually.

- **MVP Delivery Timeframe:** We might estimate Phase 1 could be delivered in (for example) 3-6 months, given the breadth, if a sufficient dev team is allocated. This gives an idea to stakeholders about when a usable product is available.

### 9.2 Phase 2 – Enhanced Functionality

**Goal:** Build upon the MVP with features that greatly improve the system’s utility, efficiency, and appeal but were not absolutely required on day one. These are **high-priority enhancements** once the basics are in place.

**Key Features in Phase 2 (Should-Haves):**

- **Multi-Warehouse & Advanced Inventory:** Extend inventory management to support multiple warehouses. Introduce the order allocation logic to choose fulfillment location. Add features like stock transfer between warehouses and per-warehouse reorder points. This phase also brings the **goods-in (receiving) workflow** to full maturity (scanning POs, etc.), which might have been manual in MVP.
- **Returns Management (RMA Module):** Implement a dedicated returns workflow. In MVP, maybe returns were handled by manually adjusting stock and creating refund offline. Now, provide the UI to create return orders, track them, and integrate with inventory (put returned goods back into stock if sellable). This feature depends on order and inventory modules (both must handle the reversal/adjustment logic).
- **Additional Shipping Capabilities:**

  - Integrate more carriers and support international shipping (customs forms, multi-package shipments).
  - Add shipping cost calculation at order time for multiple carriers (so user can choose cheapest or fastest).
  - Possibly introduce a shipping rule engine (free shipping conditions, automatic carrier selection by zone).
  - If MVP left out insurance or special options, implement them now (with UI to add insurance, etc., and API calls to carriers for those).

- **Workflow Automation & Rules:** Add more automation to reduce manual steps:

  - e.g., an option to auto-approve orders under certain conditions, auto-send email to purchasing if stock falls below threshold.
  - These require the base features from Phase 1; now layering on “if-this-then-that” configurations.

- **Integrations with External Systems:**

  - Build connectors or APIs for popular systems like **CRM (Salesforce)** and **Accounting/ERP (e.g., QuickBooks, NetSuite)**. In MVP, one might export CSVs to move data; in Phase 2, implement direct sync.
  - Also, **e-commerce platform integration**: If the OMS can pull orders from Shopify/Magento or push updates back, implement those flows now. They depend on stable order APIs from MVP.
  - These integrations have dependencies: need robust API endpoints in OMS (likely built in MVP to some extent for the UI, but might need polishing for external use).

- **Reporting & Analytics Improvements:** Expand the reporting module:

  - Add more reports (all those listed in Section 7 that were not in MVP). For example, introduce Inventory Turnover report, Customer LTV report, etc.
  - Possibly add a **report builder or custom query tool** if users demand flexibility.
  - Introduce charts and visualization for key reports (if MVP only had tables).
  - Consider implementing scheduled reports or at least saving report presets for quick reuse.
  - These enhancements depend on having accumulated enough data and feedback on which metrics are most useful; technologically, it may also involve optimizing the database or adding a data warehouse if queries are heavy.

- **UX Enhancements & Refinements:** Based on user feedback from MVP:

  - Improve the UI/UX, e.g., add keyboard shortcuts, streamline any clunky workflows, add tooltips and help text where users got confused.
  - Possibly create role-specific **UI views**: for instance, a simplified mobile-friendly view for warehouse scanning (maybe a dedicated mobile app or PWA in this phase).
  - Implement an **in-app notification system** (e.g., alerting a sales user that an order they placed has shipped, or alerting admin of integration failures) to reduce reliance on email or external comms for internal events.
  - These improvements depend on having a stable UI from Phase 1 to iterate on.

- **Permission Management UI:** If MVP had roles hard-coded or no UI to edit them, now deliver a friendly interface for admins to customize permissions (as described in user stories). This depends on underlying role-based access being implemented (Phase 1) but now gives flexibility to admin.
- **Scalability Boosts:** If MVP was tested with moderate load, Phase 2 might involve behind-the-scenes work to ensure scaling for larger clients:

  - Implement database sharding or read replicas if needed.
  - Optimize code paths identified as slow (maybe through load testing done post-MVP).
  - Introduce caching for expensive operations (e.g., caching inventory lookups or product data).
  - These tasks depend on seeing how the system performs in real use (so Phase 1 in production or pilot usage yields insight).

- **Failover/HA Improvements:** Automate more of the high availability – for instance, implement auto-failover for DB, multi-AZ or multi-region deployment for the app. Possibly target a higher uptime SLA (like 99.99%) after proving stable 99.9% in Phase 1.
- **Compliance & Security Enhancements:**

  - Phase 2 will address any gaps to pass certifications: e.g., undergo a SOC 2 audit and implement any missing controls (maybe more extensive monitoring alerts, formal incident response procedures, etc.).
  - Might also add features like two-factor authentication for user login, IP whitelisting options for admin login, etc., if requested by enterprise clients.
  - These depend on having user management in place and respond to security reviews of MVP.

### 9.3 Future Roadmap (Phase 3 and beyond – Nice-to-Haves and Advanced Features)

**Goal:** Outline longer-term ideas that are not immediate priorities but could differentiate the product or address advanced use cases. These are **Could-Have** features, often to be scheduled after core business needs are met or as the market demands.

- **Business Intelligence & AI Integration:**

  - Introduce AI-driven features such as **demand forecasting** (the system analyzes past sales and seasonal trends to suggest reorder quantities or predict stockouts) and **predictive analytics** (e.g., predicting delivery delays or identifying orders likely to be fraudulent using ML).
  - Provide more advanced analytics dashboards, possibly with interactive drill-downs and forecasting visuals. This builds upon the data collected over time and might use machine learning services or custom algorithms.
  - Dependency: requires large data volume and Phase 2’s robust reporting foundation. Likely will use external ML libraries or cloud AI services.

- **Customer Portal / Self-Service:** Develop a portal where end customers (or B2B clients) can **track their orders**, download invoices, or even place new orders (for B2B reorder scenarios). This would extend the system’s user base and reduce load on support for status queries.

  - This requires careful permission (each customer only sees their data) and possibly a separate simplified UI. It would heavily depend on the stability of order and customer modules. Essentially turning parts of the internal system outward, which might raise additional security considerations.

- **Mobile App:** Although the web UI is responsive, a dedicated mobile app (Android/iOS) for certain roles could improve UX (e.g., a warehouse scanning app that works offline, or a sales app to quickly create orders on a tablet during client visits).

  - This would depend on having robust public APIs (which by Phase 2 we likely have for integrations). It’s an iteration mainly on UI technology.

- **Expanded Integration Ecosystem:**

  - Build plug-and-play integrations with more services: e.g., connect to a wider range of **marketplaces** (Amazon, eBay APIs to import orders), **supplier systems** (to send automatic POs when stock is low), or **EDI** support for older supply chain integration.
  - Possibly develop an **app marketplace/SDK** for the OMS if third-parties want to build extensions (this is a very advanced stage for a SaaS product, essentially platform-izing it).
  - These ideas depend on the product gaining a large user base and needing to integrate in many directions, which is a later-stage consideration.

- **Performance Tuning for Enterprise Scale:** If onboarding much larger clients, further optimizations may be needed:

  - Partitioning databases by client or function (to isolate very large data sets).
  - Advanced caching strategies, maybe event-driven updates to caches for instant propagation.
  - Support for thousands of concurrent users and API calls – might consider migrating to microservices fully with separate scaling of hot spots (e.g., inventory service on its own cluster if needed).
  - This is ongoing technical work aligning with acquiring enterprise customers; a dependency is proof that current architecture needs that split (so only do it when scale dictates).

- **UI Personalization and Localization:**

  - Offer more customization of the UI for each client (their branding, ability to add custom fields or workflows). E.g., one company might want an extra field on orders for an internal code – future versions might allow custom fields and logic.
  - Full localization to other languages to expand to non-English speaking markets.
  - These depend on client demand and strategic direction (e.g., expanding to Europe or Asia might necessitate localization).

- **Continuous Improvement of Compliance:**

  - As laws change, future releases will adapt (for instance, if a new privacy law comes out, implement necessary features).
  - Also possibly achieve additional certifications (ISO 27001, etc.) which may require specific features (like encryption key management options, customer-controlled encryption keys, etc., in very security-conscious environments).

### 9.4 Feature Dependencies Summary

To visualize some critical dependencies:

- **Orders module** is foundational – needed before shipping, reporting (sales), returns, etc.
- **Inventory module** must work closely with Orders; essentially these two are co-dependent to deliver core flow. Without inventory tracking, order taking is incomplete (overselling risk).
- **Shipping integration** depends on Orders (needs order data) and enhances the fulfillment part of lifecycle. It can be developed in parallel with core order flow, but testing integration needs order data ready.
- **Returns depend on Orders and Inventory** (because return affects stock and is linked to an order).
- **Multi-warehouse depends on single-warehouse logic being stable**; it's an extension of inventory and fulfillment logic.
- **User roles system** underpins access for all features; needs to be there early, though the UI to manage it can come later.
- **Reporting** depends on data from orders, inventory, etc. You usually build some basic reports once those features produce data. More complex reports depend on a variety of data (so basically after orders, inventory, returns are all generating data, then you can do advanced reports).
- **Integrations** often depend on stable internal APIs and data model. So those usually come after the internal flows are solid, to avoid rewriting integrations if core changes.
- **UI/UX improvements** depend on initial UI being used and feedback; thus naturally phase 2+.
- **Scalability and performance tweaks** depend on having something to measure; so after MVP is used under load, we optimize in further phases.

### 9.5 Prioritization Approach

Throughout development, we will use a prioritization approach aligning with business needs:

- **Must-Have (High priority):** Features without which the product cannot deliver its basic value. (These were in Phase 1 MVP.)
- **Should-Have (Medium priority):** Important features that significantly enhance usability or coverage, but the product can function without them in the short term. (Many Phase 2 items.)
- **Could-Have (Low priority):** Useful additions or nice-to-haves that can be scheduled when time permits, often with less urgency. (Many Phase 3 ideas.)
- **Won’t Have (for now):** Items consciously put out of scope for the foreseeable roadmap, either because they are not critical or conflict with focus. This might include things like an integrated e-commerce storefront (since we focus on backend OMS), or support for very niche features not needed by majority.

For example, **real-time inventory and order processing** were Must-Have, whereas **AI-driven analytics** is a Could-Have future item. We will regularly reassess priorities based on user feedback and market demands – the roadmap is a living plan, but this outline gives a clear initial direction.

**Timeline Sketch:** (for illustration)

- _Q1-Q2:_ Build and launch MVP (Phase 1).
- _Q3:_ Collect feedback, harden system, begin Phase 2 features like returns and multi-warehouse.
- _Q4:_ Release Phase 2 major updates (returns, multi-warehouse, more integrations, reports).
- _Next Year:_ Work on Phase 3 items like advanced analytics, broader integrations, etc., driven by client requests and strategic goals.

Each phase will include thorough testing and documentation updates (user guides for new features, etc.). We will also continuously improve based on actual usage patterns (e.g., if we see users struggle with a particular workflow, we’ll adjust priorities to fix that sooner).

---

**Document Navigation and Traceability:** All requirements above are structured clearly by category. Each requirement can be traced to user stories (section 4) ensuring a user-centric design, and each will be tested against the acceptance criteria defined. Non-functional requirements (section 2) are considered in architecture decisions (section 5) and will be verified during QA (e.g., performance tests, security audits). This roadmap (section 9) ensures the project can proceed in logical increments.

With this comprehensive PRD, the product team and stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the SaaS Order Management System will deliver, how it will behave, and how it will evolve over time, setting the stage for successful implementation and deployment of the product.
