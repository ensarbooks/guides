# Aurora Mental Health Platform – Product Documentation

## Introduction

Aurora is a comprehensive **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) mental health platform** designed to streamline behavioral healthcare operations from intake to outcomes. This document provides product managers with an in-depth view of Aurora’s features, architecture, and benefits. Each section details how Aurora’s modules function, the problems they solve, and real-world use cases demonstrating value. The platform’s key focus areas include **regulatory compliance (HIPAA, state reporting)**, a **modular and scalable design**, **customizable digital workflows** (intake forms, e-signature consents), **multiplan support** (e.g. treatment plans, IEPs), **integrated telehealth tools**, robust **notes and outcome tracking**, a **360° client journey view**, **automated notifications and dashboards**, and **provider capacity management with reporting**. The goal of Aurora is to provide an end-to-end secure solution that improves care quality, enhances efficiency, and ensures all compliance and reporting needs are met.

**Document Structure:** After an overview of the platform’s security and design principles, each major feature area is presented in its own section. Features are described with detailed explanations, **benefits**, and _sample use cases_ to illustrate their application. Diagrams and mockups are included to visualize workflows and user interfaces, and tables summarize key points and feature matrices. This formal documentation will enable product managers to understand Aurora’s capabilities and guide strategic decisions for product development and client implementation.

## Security, Compliance, and Data Protection

Aurora has been built with a **security-first approach** to meet stringent healthcare regulations like **HIPAA**. Protecting sensitive Personal Health Information (PHI) is paramount. This section explains how Aurora ensures end-to-end security and compliance, including data encryption, user access controls, audit trails, and compliance reporting. Product managers will appreciate how these features not only **mitigate risk** but also serve as competitive differentiators in the healthcare market.

### HIPAA Compliance and Standards

Aurora is fully **HIPAA-compliant**, employing administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect health information. All data at rest is encrypted using strong ciphers (e.g. AES-256 encryption) to prevent unauthorized access. In transit, data is secured via TLS/SSL encryption channels. The platform can be deployed in HIPAA-ready cloud infrastructure with network isolation; for example, separate private subnets for databases containing PHI add an extra layer of protection. **Access controls** are granular – each user must authenticate and is granted role-based permissions ensuring they can only access the minimum necessary information (per the HIPAA “least privilege” principle). Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is supported for added login security. Aurora’s cloud hosting adheres to HIPAA’s **shared responsibility model**, meaning the cloud provider handles physical data center security while Aurora’s team ensures the application and data architecture are configured compliant to HIPAA guidelines.

To maintain compliance, Aurora signs Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with its customers and also with sub-service providers (e.g. cloud hosting) as needed. All system components – from databases to backups – are designed with HIPAA compliance in mind. For example, backups of PHI data are encrypted and retained according to HIPAA retention policies, and data disposal procedures follow NIST guidelines for media sanitization to permanently destroy PHI when required. By strictly following recognized standards, Aurora ensures clients can trust that using the platform will keep them in compliance with HIPAA and other privacy laws.

### End-to-End Security Features

Security is woven into every layer of Aurora’s architecture. **Authentication and authorization** modules control user identity and access. Administrators can configure password policies and session timeout durations; for instance, automatic log-off after periods of inactivity (configurable, e.g. 15 minutes) prevents unauthorized access on unattended devices, aligning with HIPAA recommendations. All user actions are logged in detailed **audit trails**. Aurora tracks logins, record accesses, edits, and exports, creating an immutable audit log for compliance auditing. Audit logs capture the who/what/when of each access, helping organizations demonstrate compliance with requirements to monitor information access. The platform also includes **integrity checks**: any modification of a clinical note or record is timestamped and versioned, so historical data cannot be surreptitiously altered without leaving a trace.

Aurora employs **data encryption keys management** best practices. Encryption keys are stored securely (e.g. using an HSM or cloud key management service) and rotated regularly. All PHI attachments or documents uploaded (such as scanned external reports) are encrypted in storage (for example, using AWS KMS managed keys if on AWS infrastructure). Additionally, the platform supports **IP access rules** for enterprise clients – allowing restriction of system access only from approved networks or VPNs. In terms of physical security, when deployed on the cloud, data centers hold relevant certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.) and Aurora leverages those compliance guarantees in its own risk management documentation.

**Disaster recovery and availability** are also crucial for compliance. Aurora maintains regular encrypted backups (with options for point-in-time recovery) and supports geo-redundancy (e.g. multi-availability-zone deployments) to ensure continuity of care even during outages. These measures align with HIPAA’s requirements for availability and emergency access to data. In summary, Aurora’s security design gives organizations confidence that patient data is safe, private, and accessible to authorized personnel only – a foundational aspect of any healthcare product.

### Compliance Reporting and Audit Support

Beyond data security, Aurora assists with **compliance reporting** and oversight. Built-in reports help administrators ensure they are meeting both internal policies and external regulatory requirements. For example, **audit reports** can be generated to show all access to a high-risk client’s records over a given time, which is useful for internal compliance checks or responding to audits. The system can produce a HIPAA **Accounting of Disclosures** report on demand, listing any external disclosures of PHI. It also tracks user login attempts (including failures), and can alert admins to suspicious activities (e.g. multiple failed logins or access from an unrecognized device/IP). These capabilities help organizations proactively maintain compliance and quickly address any potential breaches or violations.

Aurora stays current with healthcare regulations. The platform’s compliance team monitors changes (such as new rules under the 21st Century Cures Act or state-specific privacy laws) and updates the software accordingly. **Reporting templates** for compliance are updated as standards evolve, so product managers can be assured that the system will continue to meet emerging requirements without significant new development. In essence, Aurora not only _checks the box_ for compliance, but actively reduces the compliance burden on agencies – one of our core aims is to “take the burden off you by handling essential compliance requirements and leaving you to take care of your clients”. By automating privacy and security safeguards and providing clear reporting tools, Aurora enables organizations to focus on delivering quality care rather than worrying about audits or penalties.

## Architecture and Modular Design

Aurora’s architecture is built to be **modular, flexible, and scalable**, allowing organizations to tailor the system to their needs and ensuring the platform can grow with increased usage. This section gives an overview of the system’s design, including its major modules and how they interact. We also outline how the architecture supports high performance, reliability, and easy integration. The modular approach means each feature set (forms, telehealth, notes, etc.) is a component that can operate independently yet seamlessly integrates into a unified whole. Product managers can enable or disable modules as needed for different deployments, making Aurora adaptable for various contexts (private practice, large clinic, school-based program, etc.).

**Key Design Principles:**

- _Separation of Concerns:_ Different functional areas (e.g., intake, clinical notes, billing, etc.) are handled by distinct services or modules, which communicate through secure APIs.
- _Scalability:_ The system can scale horizontally – for example, additional application servers can be added under a load balancer to accommodate more concurrent users or telehealth sessions. Data storage is optimized via a relational database for structured data (clients, sessions, notes) and a separate document storage for files, enabling each to scale as needed.
- _Flexibility:_ Aurora’s modular design allows customization and configuration without code changes. New forms, fields, or workflows can be added through configuration. Integration points (like webhooks and APIs) allow external systems to connect to Aurora’s modules.
- _High Availability:_ The architecture supports deployment across multiple server instances and availability zones to ensure uptime. Components have failover strategies (for example, a secondary database for automatic failover) so that critical functionality remains available.
- _Data Consistency and Integrity:_ A unified database (or a well-orchestrated combination of databases) ensures that all modules reference a single source of truth for client data. This eliminates duplication and keeps the **360° view of the client** accurate system-wide.

To illustrate, the diagram below provides a conceptual view of Aurora’s architecture and modules:

&#x20;_Figure: A conceptual client journey and data flow through Aurora’s modules, from referral & intake through outcome tracking. The platform’s modular design supports each stage (intake forms, consent, assessment, treatment planning, sessions, outcomes, etc.), all feeding into a unified client record. Loops indicate iterative processes like ongoing sessions and periodic plan reviews._

(Note: _In the above diagram, each rounded box represents a module or major function, and arrows indicate the typical flow of information or process sequence. Dashed lines show how outcomes and plan reviews loop back into ongoing therapy until discharge._)

### Modular Components and Services

Aurora is composed of multiple **modules** that work together. Each module encapsulates a set of features, which makes the system easier to maintain and extend. The modules communicate via well-defined APIs or through the central database. Below is an overview of Aurora’s primary modules and their core responsibilities:

| **Module**                       | **Description & Key Functions**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Compliance & State Reporting** | Reporting utilities to generate required outputs for state and federal programs. Supports compliance with standards like Meaningful Use, MIPS, and specific state reporting mandates. Can produce program-specific reports (e.g. for HCBS waivers, CCBHC outcomes) and includes an **Electronic Visit Verification (EVV)** module for applicable services. |

This modular breakdown shows how Aurora’s design segments functionality. For example, some customers (like a small private practice) may not need the **State Reporting** module or may initially disable the **Telehealth** module if they use a separate solution. Product managers can configure a deployment by selecting the modules needed, and because each module is loosely coupled, the system remains stable and coherent when modules are toggled on or off. Integration between modules is seamless — e.g., the _Custom Form_ module feeds data to the _Client 360° View_ and can trigger _Notifications_ (for instance, when a new intake form is submitted), or the _Outcome Tracking_ module feeds summary data to the _Analytics Dashboard_. This ensures that while the architecture is modular, the **user experience remains unified**.

### Scalability and Performance

Aurora is engineered to perform well with a handful of users or thousands of concurrent users. The cloud-native design (containerized services and auto-scaling groups, for instance) allows it to automatically allocate more resources under high load. Key performance considerations include:

- **Responsive UI:** The web interface and mobile apps are optimized with asynchronous loading and caching for snappy performance, even when pulling large client records or lists. Dashboards refresh data at configurable intervals and heavy data computations (like generating analytics or state reports) are offloaded to background jobs to avoid slowing down interactive use.
- **Database Optimization:** Aurora’s databases use indexing and partitioning strategies to handle large volumes of records (e.g., tens of thousands of notes or form submissions) without slow-down. Frequently accessed data (like active client lists or today’s appointments) may be cached in memory for quick retrieval.
- **Scalable Services:** Modules like the Telehealth Video Service leverage scalable communication servers that can handle high-throughput audio/video streams. The video service uses technologies (e.g., WebRTC and TURN servers) that scale horizontally, ensuring that even if many video sessions occur simultaneously, call quality remains high. Similarly, the Notification Engine can process large batches of alerts through a work queue to handle spikes (like sending daily reminders each morning) without timing out.
- **Monitoring and Auto-Scaling:** The platform includes monitoring hooks; if CPU usage or response times exceed certain thresholds, additional server instances can spin up. For example, if many users start uploading large documents at once, an autoscaler can add another file storage service instance. This elasticity ensures consistent performance during peak usage times.
- **High Availability:** Aurora supports deployment in a multi-zone configuration. If one data center or server instance goes down, another takes over (failover). Load balancers direct traffic to healthy instances. The system’s critical services have redundancy – e.g., primary and secondary database replicas (with synchronous replication) so that a secondary can take over with no data loss if the primary fails. This design minimizes downtime, which is crucial for providers who rely on Aurora to access schedules and client information throughout the day.

**Integration Friendly:** Even with a rich set of in-built modules, Aurora recognizes organizations may have other systems (e.g., external EHRs, billing systems, or educational systems for school-based programs). The architecture provides a robust REST API for all major modules, allowing external systems to push or pull data (with proper authorization). Webhooks are available for key events (e.g., “a new referral is created” or “a note is signed and locked”), enabling workflows that extend beyond Aurora. This modern API-driven approach ensures that Aurora can be integrated into a larger digital ecosystem as needed, enhancing its modular nature by also playing well with third-party modules.

In summary, Aurora’s architecture achieves **flexibility without compromising cohesion**. It lets product managers configure the solution for various settings, scales to enterprise-level usage, and maintains high performance and reliability. This solid foundation supports the rich feature set described in the following sections.

## Custom Forms and Data Collection

One of Aurora’s standout capabilities is its **Custom Form Builder**, which empowers organizations to digitize and tailor their intake and data collection processes. Instead of being constrained to generic forms, users can create **bespoke intake forms, assessments, and referral forms** that match their unique workflows and information requirements. The Custom Forms module is highly intuitive: it features a **drag-and-drop form designer** that requires no technical skills, enabling quick creation of complex forms.

**Key Features of the Form Builder:**

- **Drag-and-Drop Editor:** Build forms by dragging fields (text boxes, dropdowns, checkboxes, signature fields, etc.) onto a canvas. The interface is user-friendly, making form creation as simple as arranging blocks. _For example, a clinic can drag in a “Depression Severity (PHQ-9)” question field or a “Consent Signature” field as needed._ This intuitive customization is a major selling point – in fact, industry reviews note that drag-and-drop dynamic forms make it easy to build tailored intake forms and collect exactly the information needed.
- **Field Types and Widgets:** Aurora supports all common field types (single-line text, paragraph text, multiple choice, scales, date pickers, file uploads for documents or images, etc.). It also includes healthcare-specific widgets, such as insurance information sections, emergency contact fields, and standardized screening tools. Fields can be marked as required or optional, and can have validation rules (e.g. date of birth cannot be a future date, phone numbers must match a pattern, etc.).
- **Conditional Logic:** Administrators can create dynamic forms that show or hide sections based on responses. For instance, if a client answers “Yes” to a question about prior treatment, additional fields can appear to gather more details. This **conditional branching** ensures clients or staff only see relevant questions, keeping forms concise and personalized.
- **Templates and Cloning:** Aurora comes with a library of pre-built form templates for common uses – e.g., a standard intake questionnaire, a suicide risk assessment, or a referral form. Users can start from these templates and modify them, or clone and tweak their own forms, which saves time and promotes consistency. Templates are designed with best practices in mind (for example, including all data points needed for certain state reporting).
- **Multi-Step Forms:** Long forms can be broken into multiple pages or sections with progress indicators, to avoid overwhelming the user. A client filling out an intake form at home, for example, might see sections like Personal Info, Medical History, Consents, etc., one at a time. This improves completion rates and user experience.
- **Branding and Embedding:** Organizations can brand their forms with logos and custom instructions. Forms can be accessed via a secure link, embedded in the client portal, or even embedded on an external website (for things like self-referrals). This flexibility means clients can fill out forms on their own device, prior to a visit, reducing time spent on paperwork in clinics.

**Use Case – Custom Intake Form:** A community mental health clinic uses Aurora’s form builder to create a **comprehensive intake packet** for new clients. The packet includes demographics, medical history, presenting problems, and several standardized questionnaires. Using conditional logic, the form shows substance use questions only if the client indicated a history of substance use, keeping the flow relevant and shorter for others. The clinic adds an e-signature field at the end for clients to sign consent to treatment. Once a client fills this out through the secure Client Portal and submits, the data automatically populates the client’s profile and the signed form is saved in their document section. Intake coordinators no longer have to chase paperwork – everything is captured electronically and **automatically attached to the client’s chart**, drastically reducing administrative work.

**Integration with Other Modules:** Custom forms tie in tightly with other platform features. Data from intake or assessment forms becomes immediately available in the **Client 360° View** (e.g., the answers to a PHQ-9 questionnaire are visible under that client’s assessments tab). If certain responses warrant follow-up actions, the **Notification Engine** can trigger alerts – for example, if a client’s intake form indicates risk of self-harm, the system can alert a supervisor instantly. Additionally, form submissions can be configured to notify specific users (e.g., when a new referral form is submitted by an external referral source, intake staff get an alert). Forms can also capture **initial treatment plan inputs**, like problem areas, which flow into the Treatment Plan module as draft goals.

**Custom Referral Forms:** Aside from client intakes, organizations often need to collect referrals from external sources (schools, primary care doctors, etc.). Aurora allows creation of dedicated **referral forms** that can be shared as public links. These forms might include fields for the referring party’s information, the client’s info, reason for referral, and urgency. When an external provider fills out this form, Aurora can automatically create a pending client record or notify an intake coordinator to review the referral. This streamlines the referral process and ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

**Data Collection and Analysis:** The data captured via custom forms doesn’t just sit in individual client files – Aurora provides tools to **aggregate and analyze form data**. For instance, the platform can generate a report or table of all responses to a particular question (useful for program evaluation or grant reporting). If an agency adds a custom question like “How did you hear about us?” to their intake form, they could later pull a report to see referral sources across all intakes for a period. The ability to mine custom form data for insights is a powerful advantage for product managers who want to demonstrate outcomes or refine outreach strategies.

In summary, Aurora’s Custom Forms module offers **unmatched flexibility** in capturing the exact data needed for each organization’s workflows. It replaces paper forms and static PDFs with interactive, smart forms that **simplify data entry, improve client experience, and reduce admin burdens**. The drag-and-drop customization and automatic integration into client records make it a cornerstone of the platform’s value proposition, as noted by industry users who praise the ease of building tailored intake forms and having them seamlessly integrated.

## Consent Management and E-Signature

Handling consent forms and signatures is a critical (and often cumbersome) part of mental health workflows. Aurora addresses this with a built-in **Consent Management** module that digitizes consent forms and approvals. No more printing, scanning, or chasing physical signatures – the platform allows **electronic consent capture** in a secure and compliant way. This section details how Aurora manages consents, the e-signature workflow, and benefits in terms of efficiency and compliance.

**Digital Consent Forms:** Aurora lets administrators create and manage all the various consent and policy forms used by an organization. This might include general treatment consent, telehealth consent, release of information forms (ROIs), privacy policy acknowledgments, consent for photography or recording sessions, etc. Using a similar editor as the Custom Forms, each consent form template can be created with rich text (to include the legal verbiage) and one or more signature fields. Consent forms can also pull in dynamic data; for example, the client’s name and date can auto-populate at the top, and the clinician’s name and credentials can auto-fill in the provider signature section if needed.

**E-Signature Workflow:** The platform supports **legally binding electronic signatures** compliant with the E-SIGN Act and UETA. Here’s how the typical workflow functions:

1. A staff member selects a consent form (or a packet of multiple forms) to send to a client – often as part of intake or when a specific consent is required (e.g., before starting telehealth sessions). They can send it via the Client Portal or email a secure link.
2. The client (or their guardian, if applicable) receives a notification and accesses the form on any device (phone, tablet, computer). The form clearly presents the information and includes fields for signature (which can be drawn with a finger/stylus or simply typed to adopt a signature).
3. The client signs electronically; Aurora records a timestamp and the client’s authenticated identity (portal login or verified email) to create a digital signature certificate. If multiple signatures are needed (e.g., client and a witness, or client and provider), the form can route to each party in turn.
4. Once signed by all required parties, the consent form is locked as a PDF (with signatures embedded) and stored in the client’s record. The staff is notified that the consent is completed. The signed document can be viewed or downloaded at any time and is available for audits or if the client needs a copy.

This workflow eliminates paper and is much faster – what used to take days of back-and-forth can often be completed in minutes online. Clients appreciate the convenience of not having to come in just to sign forms, and providers appreciate that the signed forms are automatically organized in the system.

**Integration with Client Portal:** The Client Portal is an integral part of the e-sign process. Clients can log in to their portal and see a **“Forms to Sign”** section with any pending consent requests. They can sign at their convenience, and even save progress if the form is long (though consents are usually straightforward). The portal also stores copies of what they signed for their reference, which improves transparency. For those who may not use the portal, secure email links with OTP (one-time passcodes) allow signature without full login, maintaining flexibility in obtaining consent.

**Provider Signature and Co-signatures:** Aurora also supports cases where the provider needs to sign after the client (for example, clinician signing a treatment plan or a supervisor co-signing a consent for a minor). The workflow can accommodate multiple signatures in sequence. A common scenario: a therapist reviews the consent signed by a teen client and then adds their signature to document they explained the form. Aurora will mark the consent as fully executed only after all parties sign. Each signature event is logged with user identity and time, forming a comprehensive audit trail. This ensures **accountability and legal defensibility** of the e-consents.

**Compliance and Security of E-Signatures:** Electronic signatures captured in Aurora meet healthcare compliance standards. The system uses encrypted links and requires authentication before signing, thereby verifying the signer’s identity (a key requirement for legal e-signature). Each signed document includes a certificate page noting details like IP address of signer, timestamp, and a unique document hash to detect any tampering. This means the digital consents are as legally valid as ink on paper – but far more efficient to manage. In mental health specifically, where informed consent is vital (for treatment, for telehealth, for information sharing), being able to gather those consents remotely is a game-changer. It **improves patient experience and efficiency**, as noted by industry analysts who list benefits like time savings, cost reduction on paper, and better patient onboarding as results of e-signature adoption in healthcare.

**Use Case – Telehealth Consent:** Suppose a clinic is starting to offer teletherapy. Prior to a client’s first video session, they need the client’s consent for telehealth. Using Aurora, the admin simply assigns the “Telehealth Consent” form to the client via the portal. The client gets an email notification, logs in, reads the consent which explains risks and confidentiality for online sessions, and signs electronically. Aurora alerts the clinician that the consent is signed and they are clear to proceed with virtual sessions. The signed form is automatically linked to the client’s profile. The entire process is **paperless and can be completed in one sitting**, whereas previously it might have required mailing forms or an in-person visit just to collect a signature.

**Custom Consent Workflows:** Aurora’s flexibility extends to consents as well. You can create **bundles** of forms (e.g., an intake packet that includes general consent, financial agreement, privacy notice acknowledgment, etc.) to send all at once. There is also a feature for **annual re-consent** – for agencies that require clients to renew consent each year, the system can prompt and manage that process automatically. The Notification Engine ties in here by reminding clients when a consent is due for renewal. On the admin side, there are dashboards for consent status, so staff can quickly see if any active client is missing a required consent or if something is expired, ensuring compliance oversight.

**Benefits Summary:** The Consent Management and E-Signature module offers:

- _Efficiency:_ Dramatically faster turnaround on required paperwork, reducing delays in starting treatment.
- _Convenience:_ Clients can sign from anywhere, on any device – improving engagement and removing barriers (especially important for clients in remote areas or with mobility issues).
- _Organization:_ All signed documents are automatically filed; no risk of lost papers. Searching for a consent is as easy as a click.
- _Compliance:_ Detailed logs and secure signatures mean audits are stress-free. An auditor can be shown an exact report of when and by whom a consent was signed, with assurance that it hasn’t been altered.
- _Cost Savings:_ Less printing and scanning, and less staff time spent managing forms, translates to lower operational costs.

Aurora’s approach to digital consent and e-signature aligns with the wider healthcare industry trend of leveraging technology to streamline patient intake and consent processes – **improving patient experience while maintaining compliance**. By incorporating these tools, product managers can ensure that their organizations remain efficient and client-friendly in administrative tasks, which ultimately supports better care delivery.

## Treatment Plans and Multiplan Tracking

Effective treatment in mental health and related fields often requires structured plans that outline goals, interventions, and progress measures. Aurora’s platform includes a robust **Treatment Plan Management** feature that not only allows clinicians to create individualized treatment plans, but also supports **multiple plan types** and iterative updates over time. This is particularly useful for agencies that might work with various types of plans – for example, a community mental health center might handle traditional therapy treatment plans, state-mandated service plans, and even school-based Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Aurora’s **multiplan tracking** means you can manage all these within one client record, providing flexibility and organization for complex cases.

### Creating and Customizing Plans

Clinicians (or other authorized staff) can easily create a **Treatment Plan** for a client using Aurora’s plan builder. A plan typically includes:

- **Problem Statements or Needs:** What issues are being addressed (e.g., “Anxiety symptoms impacting daily functioning”).
- **Goals:** Broad goals related to each problem (e.g., “Reduce anxiety to moderate levels”).
- **Objectives:** Measurable, time-bound objectives that lead to the goal (e.g., “Client will learn and use 3 new coping skills for anxiety as reported in weekly sessions within 8 weeks”).
- **Interventions/Methods:** The specific therapeutic interventions or services that will be used (e.g., “CBT therapy weekly”, “Medication evaluation”, “School accommodations”).
- **Target Dates and Frequencies:** When objectives should be met or reviewed, and how often interventions occur.
- **Progress Updates:** A section for ongoing updates on each objective (to mark progress, achieved, modified, etc.).

Aurora provides templates for common plan types. For example, an **IEP template** might have additional sections for academic goals and must meet educational format standards, whereas a **Treatment Plan** template might include DSM-5 diagnoses and clinician signatures. Users can start from these templates and then customize content. The text editor within the plan builder allows rich text, so users can elaborate on goals or interventions clearly. Drop-down menus can supply standard options (like a library of common goals or interventions) to speed up the process while still allowing free-text entry for customization.

### Multiplan Support

A single client might have **multiple concurrent or sequential plans**. Aurora’s design supports this by organizing plans into separate “cases” or plan records under the client. For instance, a client could have a “Therapy Treatment Plan” and an “IEP from School” simultaneously, each with its own set of goals and responsible staff. The platform interface clearly lists all active and past plans for the client. Users can switch between them or view them in an integrated timeline. This separation ensures clarity – each plan is a distinct document – yet all are accessible in one place.

TheraNest (a similar EHR) uses the concept of multiple “Cases” per client to handle evolving needs, and found it very useful for separating documentation sets. Aurora follows a similar philosophy, allowing **distinct sets of notes, goals, and assessments per plan or case**. This is especially helpful if a client’s situation changes over time – e.g., they might complete an initial treatment episode, then return a year later with a new set of issues; you can start a new plan while keeping the old one on file for reference. For youth clients, there might be an **individual plan** as well as a **family service plan**; Aurora can maintain both. By supporting multiple plans, the platform reflects real-world practice where individuals may engage in various programs or levels of care over time.

### Plan Reviews and Updates

Aurora not only helps in creating plans but also in **tracking and updating** them. Treatment plans are living documents – they require periodic review (often every 30, 60, or 90 days, depending on regulations or agency policy) and updating goals as progress is made. The platform automatically knows each plan’s review date based on the target dates set for goals or an overall review cycle. It will send **notifications** to the responsible clinician as those dates approach (e.g., “Treatment Plan for John Doe due for review next week”) so that nothing slips through. On the plan interface, the clinician can open an existing plan and record a **review note**: for each goal/objective, they can update progress (met, partially met, not met, or new plan of action) and then set new target dates or modify the plan if needed.

When a plan is updated, Aurora can preserve a history. For compliance and record integrity, some organizations prefer not to overwrite the original plan. In Aurora, when you do a formal plan review, you have the option to **version** the plan: the original plan is archived (still viewable) and a new version is created with the updates. Alternatively, you can keep one plan document but add dated “Review Comments” within it. The system supports both approaches to fit different documentation styles. Every time a plan is reviewed or changed, the date and user are logged, ensuring an audit trail of the plan’s evolution.

**Goal Attainment and Outcome Linking:** Because Aurora also tracks outcomes (see next section), there is a powerful feature of linking outcome measures to objectives. For instance, if a goal is to reduce anxiety and the client is completing a weekly GAD-7 anxiety scale, the system can display the GAD-7 scores graph alongside that goal. This provides objective evidence for the plan review. A clinician reviewing the plan can easily see, for example, that the client’s anxiety scores dropped from severe to mild over the plan period, indicating the goal is being achieved (and maybe ready to close). This linkage of **measurable outcomes to treatment goals** encourages data-driven care adjustments.

### Other Plan Types and Custom Plans

Aurora’s flexibility extends to handling specialized plans. Some examples:

- **Individualized Education Program (IEP):** If used in a school context, Aurora can manage IEPs, including educational goals, accommodations, and periodic school progress reports. These can be shared with authorized school staff via a secure portal. The IEP module might include custom fields like student’s grade, teacher names, etc., which can be configured.
- **Behavior Support Plans:** For clients (especially in disability or autism services) who have specific behavior intervention plans, the system can capture triggers, behaviors, and strategies, and allow tracking of behavior frequency as part of the outcomes.
- **Service Plans / Recovery Plans:** In substance use treatment or community support programs, service plans often involve multiple services (counseling, case management, housing support). Aurora lets you list services and responsible team members. The multiplan approach can also separate, say, a Substance Use Recovery Plan from a Mental Health Therapy Plan if those are distinct.
- **Custom Plans:** Agencies can define their own plan templates if needed. The form might differ, but Aurora’s engine will handle them similarly. For example, a research grant might require a specialized plan of care form – this can be set up in Aurora.

**Collaboration in Planning:** Often treatment planning is a collaborative process with the client (and family). Aurora supports printing or exporting plans to share with clients in sessions, but even better, via the Client Portal, clients can be given access to view their treatment plan and even input their own **comments or signatures**. If an organization chooses, they can enable a feature where clients digitally sign their treatment plans (confirming their participation in the planning). The provider then signs, and it’s finalized. This fosters a sense of ownership for clients in their own care planning.

**Use Case – Dual Plans:** Imagine a 14-year-old client in a youth services agency who is in therapy for trauma (requires a clinical treatment plan) and also has an IEP at school for emotional support services. Aurora allows the therapist to maintain the clinical treatment plan focused on therapy goals, while the school liaison uploads or maintains the IEP. Both plans are visible in the client’s profile. At a multidisciplinary case review meeting, staff can easily reference both documents to ensure alignment (for instance, the IEP goal for classroom anxiety reduction complements the therapy goal of social skills building). When it’s time for the quarterly IEP review, Aurora alerts the school liaison; when the therapy plan is due for review, it alerts the therapist. Each completes their respective updates, and the system logs the reviews. Over time, the client’s progress in therapy (like improved mood scores) could be correlated with school performance reports, giving a full picture of the youth’s progress.

**Compliance Benefits:** Many regulatory bodies require active, up-to-date treatment plans for every client. Aurora’s plan tracking significantly helps in compliance: administrators can run a **“Plan Status Report”** to see at a glance which clients have current plans and which plans are overdue for update. This addresses a common pain point in audits where an expired or incomplete treatment plan can lead to compliance findings. By using Aurora, agencies can demonstrate a high level of compliance – every client is engaged in a plan that is monitored and revised timely, with records (signatures, dates, progress) to prove it. One of the **dashboard widgets** can even show “Treatment Plans expiring in next 2 weeks” as a quick snapshot for managers, fulfilling that oversight function.

In summary, Aurora’s Treatment Plan and Multiplan Tracking feature provides a **structured yet flexible framework** for planning care. It ensures that for each client, care is guided by clear plans, and that these plans are kept current and effective. The ability to handle multiple plans recognizes the complexity of real clinical scenarios, and the automation around reminders and progress tracking helps maintain a high quality of care and compliance. Product managers will find that this module addresses both clinical needs (better care coordination, clear goals) and administrative needs (compliance, documentation) in one solution.

## Integrated Video and Collaboration Tools (Telehealth)

Aurora includes an **Integrated Telehealth** module that brings secure video conferencing and collaboration tools directly into the platform. This means clinicians can conduct virtual therapy sessions or remote meetings with clients **without using external software**, streamlining the experience and keeping everything within the same secure environment. Given the rise of telehealth in mental health care (accelerated by necessity and convenience), this feature is essential for a modern SaaS mental health application. Here, we describe how the video sessions work, the collaboration features available, and the benefits of having a tightly integrated telehealth solution.

&#x20;_Illustration: Example of Aurora’s integrated telehealth video session. The interface shows a therapist and client in a video call with a chat transcript on the side. Real-time transcription or note-taking can be enabled, allowing the clinician to capture important points during the session (left). The bottom control bar provides easy access to camera, microphone, screen share, participant list, and session end options._

_(In the above illustration, notice the textual transcript on the left side, which is an example of how Aurora could display live captions or a running text log for accessibility or note-taking. This is one of the collaboration-enhancing features of the integrated video tool.)_

### Telehealth Video Sessions

Aurora’s video conferencing is built on WebRTC technology, meaning sessions are high-quality and peer-to-peer encrypted. To start a session, a provider simply goes to the appointment in Aurora’s schedule and clicks “Start Telehealth Session”. The client, on their side, can join via the Client Portal or a unique secure link sent to them (via email/SMS) – no complex installs required, it runs in a web browser or the mobile app. Key aspects of the session experience include:

- **Waiting Room:** When clients join, they initially enter a virtual waiting room if the provider hasn’t started the session yet. The provider sees who has “knocked” to join and can admit them when ready. This preserves professionalism and allows providers to control the start of sessions. A custom message can be displayed in the waiting room (e.g., “Welcome, your therapist will start the session soon.”).
- **HD Video and Audio:** The connection supports HD video and clear audio, adjusting quality based on bandwidth. It also has indicators for connection strength. Even on lower bandwidth, the system tries to maintain an audio connection so the session can continue.
- **Screen Sharing:** Either party (with permission) can share their screen. Therapists might use this to show a worksheet or relaxation exercise video; clients might use it to show something they’re working on. This can be incredibly helpful for interactive therapy exercises or when explaining something visually.
- **Interactive Tools:** Aurora’s telehealth includes a built-in **whiteboard** feature where therapist and client can draw or write together on a blank screen (or on a shared document). For example, during a CBT session, a therapist might collaboratively fill out a thought record with the client on the whiteboard. There’s also a **file sharing** option: participants can send files through the chat, which can be used to share psychoeducational PDFs or homework assignments. These files are also saved to the session record for future reference.
- **Chat and Emojis:** A text chat runs alongside the video. This is useful if someone wants to paste a link, if audio drops momentarily, or for clients who feel anxious speaking (they might type some responses). It supports basic features like sending quick reactions or emojis, and the chat log can be saved. In Aurora, therapists have the option to save the chat transcript to the client’s record if it contains therapeutic content or agreements (with client consent).
- **Session Timer:** There’s an on-screen timer (visible to the provider, optional for client) indicating how long the session has been running. This helps with time management and ensures sessions stay on track. Optionally, a gentle alert can ping when, say, 5 minutes are left – a cue to start wrapping up.

Under the hood, all video sessions are **HIPAA-compliant**. Aurora signs BAAs with its video service providers and ensures data from sessions (other than what the therapist explicitly saves like notes or chat) is not stored. If recording is enabled, recordings are stored encrypted in the cloud, accessible only to authorized users.

### Scheduling and Notifications for Telehealth

The telehealth module is integrated with Aurora’s **Scheduling** system. When creating an appointment, a user just marks it as a “Video Session” (or it might be the default for certain service types). The system then automatically generates the secure session link and includes it in the appointment details. Clients get an appointment reminder notification (email/text) that includes the join link for their session, making the process smooth. At the scheduled time, they simply click the link and enter the session after any pre-call checks.

Aurora also offers **pre-call device checks** to clients joining – a quick test of their camera, mic, and internet connection. This can be presented in the waiting room to ensure they troubleshoot any issues (like a muted microphone or blocked camera) before the therapy begins, which saves session time and frustration. The system might display something like “Everything looks great – all devices are working properly” once the check passes.

### Collaboration Features During Sessions

Mental health sessions can be more than just face-to-face talk, especially in a digital setting. Aurora enriches telehealth with collaboration features:

- **Real-Time Notes & Transcription:** With client consent, therapists can enable **live transcription** of the session dialogue. This appears as text in the sidebar (as illustrated above) and can be very useful for reviewing what was said. It also aids clients with hearing difficulties or those who benefit from seeing the words. After the session, the therapist can save the transcript or excerpts to aid in writing progress notes (though transcripts are not automatically part of the medical record unless explicitly saved). Alternatively, the therapist might prefer to type notes in a private note panel during the session – Aurora supports a split-screen where you can have the video on one side and your note-taking area on the other, or even on a second monitor if available. Some systems highlight being able to write progress notes during the video session; Aurora’s interface is designed to allow that smoothly, so therapists don’t have to wait until after the call to jot down important points.
- **Shared Document Editing:** A therapist and client can work on a therapeutic worksheet together. For instance, filling out a safety plan form – the therapist can open the form within the session and both can see it. The client might verbally provide answers while the therapist types, or if the client has control (in a screen share scenario), they might type while the therapist guides. This collaborative editing makes telehealth sessions almost as interactive as in-person, where they might fill a paper form together.
- **Multi-Party Sessions:** Aurora supports inviting multiple people to a session. This is crucial for family therapy, group therapy, or bringing in an interpreter or supervisor. Up to a certain number of participants (e.g., 5 or 10, configurable) can join a single session. The host (therapist) controls who’s in it. In a family session, each participant (like a parent, child, and perhaps a school counselor joining) can connect from their own device. The security ensures only those invited can join. For group therapy, the system can even mask last names or use first-name-only to keep confidentiality among group members.
- **Session Recording (with consent):** Therapists can record sessions if needed – for supervision, or if a client wants a copy of say, a psychoeducation lecture portion. Aurora handles recording with care: it will always prompt to confirm recording and logs consent. The recording is then stored in the client’s file under a “Session Recordings” section, accessible only to those with proper rights (and possibly to the client via portal if they are allowed to view it). This feature is optional but valuable in training clinics or for risk management (some clinicians like to record high-risk sessions for review).
- **Security and Privacy Controls:** Collaboration is great, but privacy is paramount. Aurora’s video tool has features like the ability for the therapist to **blur their background** or the client’s, to ensure no sensitive info is seen if someone is calling from home. It also allows the therapist to **lock a session** (prevent anyone else from joining, even if they had the link) which can be used after all expected participants are in – this is a safeguard especially for group sessions. All collaboration data (whiteboard drawings, shared files) is considered part of the confidential session and is stored or discarded according to the therapist’s choice at end of session. Aurora does not data mine or use session content in any way other than to provide the service.

### Benefits of Integrated Telehealth

Having telehealth inside Aurora (as opposed to using third-party video like Zoom or Skype) offers significant advantages:

- **Unified Workflow:** The provider doesn’t have to juggle multiple apps. Scheduling, session launch, note-taking, and billing for that session all happen in one place. This reduces friction and error (e.g., no copying links around or accidentally sending the wrong meeting info).
- **Better Client Experience:** Clients receive one set of communications from one system. They log into the same portal for forms, appointments, and sessions. This consistency builds trust and is simpler, especially for less tech-savvy clients. Telehealth usage has been shown to improve access to care by removing distance barriers and making it convenient for clients to attend sessions – integration ensures that convenience isn’t marred by technical complexity.
- **Security & Compliance:** Using Aurora’s telehealth means all BAA and HIPAA compliance is taken care of under the same umbrella. There’s no risk of inadvertently violating privacy by using an unapproved tool. Aurora’s logs will also record that a telehealth session occurred (with time and duration), which can be useful data for reporting and compliance (e.g., for telehealth service billing or auditing usage).
- **Data for Outcomes:** The system can capture data about telehealth usage, such as how many sessions were completed virtually versus in-person, dropout rates, etc. This analytic insight can inform program decisions (like demonstrating the success of a telehealth program). It’s harder to gather such data if the telehealth is happening outside the main system.
- **Collaboration Enhancements:** As described, integrated tools like note-sharing and whiteboards are possible because the telehealth is built into the EHR environment. Using a generic video app wouldn’t easily allow pulling up a client’s treatment plan or outcome graph mid-session; with Aurora, a therapist can even display the client’s progress chart on screen share to discuss it. This can lead to richer therapeutic interactions and transparency (e.g., “Let’s look together at how your depression scores have changed over the last 8 weeks” while showing them the graph).

**Use Case – Group Therapy Session:** A therapist schedules a weekly DBT skills group with 6 participants. Through Aurora, each client gets the invite and at the time of group, all join in the Aurora telehealth room. The therapist uses the screen share to show the week’s skills worksheet. They all discuss it, and clients type questions in chat or speak up. One client is too shy to talk, so they type an update in the chat – the therapist reads it and responds. Mid-session, one client disconnects due to internet issues; Aurora’s chat indicates they left, and after they reconnect, the waiting room allows the therapist to readmit them. The session goes for 90 minutes and is recorded for the therapist’s supervision. After the session, the therapist has the recording and chat transcript saved. They quickly tag key moments in the recording for review. All of this happened within Aurora, and attendance for each client was automatically marked in their records.

Aurora’s integrated video and collaboration tools exemplify how the platform **embraces modern care delivery methods**. By making telehealth a seamless part of the system, we ensure that distance or pandemics or transportation issues are no longer barriers to care – clients get continuity of care and engagement no matter where they are. Product managers can highlight this module as a strong competitive feature, citing that telehealth not only extends service reach but can be done in Aurora with features specifically tailored for mental health (like therapy-friendly tools and real-time note integration) that generic video solutions don’t offer. It keeps the therapeutic process front and center, augmented by technology rather than interrupted by it.

## Notes Documentation and Outcome Tracking

Documentation and outcome measurement are at the heart of clinical practice in mental health. Aurora’s platform excels in providing a comprehensive **Notes** module for capturing every interaction and a powerful **Outcome Tracking** system for measuring client progress. This combination ensures that clinicians can efficiently document sessions and also quantitatively track how clients are improving (or when adjustments are needed). In this section, we’ll break down how the notes system works (including various note types and templates) and how the outcome tracking is implemented (including standardized measures and reporting of outcomes).

### Progress Notes and Clinical Documentation

Aurora’s **Notes module** allows clinicians to document all types of clinical interactions in a structured yet flexible manner. Key features of the notes component include:

- **Multiple Note Types:** Users can create notes for individual therapy sessions, group sessions, case management calls, psychiatric evaluations, supervision notes, etc. Each note type can have its own template. For example:

  - _Progress Note_ – typically used for routine therapy sessions, might have sections for subjective report, objective observations, assessment, and plan (the familiar SOAP format or DAP format).
  - _Psychiatric Evaluation_ – an initial assessment note with sections for history, mental status exam, diagnosis, and treatment plan.
  - _Group Note_ – allows documenting a group therapy session with the ability to copy relevant portions to each group member’s record while adding individualized comments.
  - _Collateral Contact_ – a note type for recording conversations with family or other providers.
  - _Crisis Note_ – a template specifically for crisis interventions, including risk assessments.

- **Customizable Templates:** Agencies can customize the content and layout of each note template using Aurora’s form-like editor (similar to the Custom Form builder). Fields can be free text, checkboxes (for quick selection of common interventions or client presentation descriptors), drop-downs (for mental status exam ratings, etc.), and so on. Many default templates are provided out-of-the-box (like a standard **SOAP note template**), which can then be tailored. Clinicians appreciate this flexibility as it adapts to their documentation style, yet still ensures consistency across the organization.
- **Pre-filled Data:** To streamline writing, Aurora can auto-populate certain fields in a note. For instance, the client’s diagnosis can be pulled in from their profile, or the objectives from the treatment plan can be listed to prompt the clinician to address progress on each. If the client completed an intake form or questionnaire, relevant answers might show up in the initial assessment note. This reduces duplicate data entry.
- **Intervention and Progress Tracking in Notes:** Within each progress note, clinicians often need to record which interventions were used and how the client responded (progress). Aurora’s note template can include checkable lists of interventions (like “CBT techniques used: cognitive restructuring \[X], exposure practice \[X]”) and a section to rate progress on treatment plan goals. Some agencies use a scale for each session (e.g., client’s mood this session 1-10, participation level, etc.) – the system can incorporate those scales.
- **Collateral Files Attachment:** If during a session a client provided a document or if there’s an image (say, of an art therapy piece) relevant to the note, the clinician can attach files directly to the note. This keeps all related info in one place.
- **Signature & Locking Workflow:** Aurora allows clinicians to **sign** their notes electronically. Once a note is signed (locked), it is time-stamped and cannot be edited (unless an addendum is made) to maintain record integrity. Supervisors can co-sign notes if needed (common in training settings or for paraprofessional documentation oversight). The platform can enforce co-signature rules – e.g., if an intern writes a note, it remains in “Pending” status until a supervisor signs off. This ensures all notes meet quality standards.
- **Search and Organization:** Notes are organized by date and type under each client’s record. Powerful search functionality allows clinicians to find past notes by keyword, date range, or tag. For example, searching “suicidal” could retrieve notes where that word appears, which is helpful for risk assessment reviews. There are also filtering options (show me all psychiatry notes, or all group notes) for quick navigation.

**Efficiency Features:** Aurora includes features to make documentation quicker without sacrificing quality:

- **Phrase Expander / Templates:** Clinicians can save common phrases or entire note templates and insert them with shortcuts. If a therapist often writes “Patient denies suicidal ideation or intent at this time,” they can create a shortcut (like `.nsf` for “no suicidal ideation”) to auto-fill that text.
- **Voice Dictation Support:** Built-in support for speech-to-text lets clinicians dictate their notes. The accuracy is high and the text appears in the note fields in real-time, which many find faster than typing. This is especially useful for those who prefer talking out their notes or for accessibility.
- **Copy Forward / Previous Note Reference:** When writing a new progress note, the clinician can optionally view the last note side-by-side, or copy forward certain fields (like the previous plan or interventions) and then update them. This reduces redundant writing and helps maintain continuity. Aurora smartly does not copy subjective statements (to avoid errors like carrying forward a last week’s mood description), but will carry forward things like the treatment plan section which often remains similar with small updates.
- **Real-time Collaboration on Notes:** In scenarios like group sessions with co-facilitators, two staff can actually work on the same note concurrently (the system will merge changes or allow one to write one section while the other writes a different section). This is a more niche feature but highlights the collaborative capability of the platform.

### Measuring Outcomes – Integrated Outcome Tracking

Aurora’s Outcome Tracking system is designed to give **tangible evidence of client progress** (or lack thereof) by utilizing standardized outcome measures and custom scales. As behavioral health moves towards evidence-based, data-driven care, tracking outcomes is crucial. Here’s how Aurora facilitates this:

- **Library of Standard Measures:** Aurora comes pre-loaded with common validated outcome measures: e.g., PHQ-9 (depression severity), GAD-7 (anxiety), PCL-5 (PTSD symptoms), WHO-5 (well-being scale), CANS/ANSA (for youth/adult needs and strengths), etc. Each measure is stored with its questions, scoring logic, and interpretation guidelines. For instance, the PHQ-9 has 9 questions each 0-3 scored, total out of 27, with severity ranges noted (5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, etc.). The system can automatically score these once a client or clinician completes the questionnaire.
- **Custom and Program-Specific Measures:** Agencies can also add their own scales or checklists if they use something proprietary or specific to a program. For example, a substance use program might track “Days of sobriety” as an outcome measure, or a child program might have a custom behavior frequency checklist. Aurora’s outcome module allows creation of custom instruments with defined items and scoring.
- **Scheduled Assessments:** Users can schedule assessments to be given at particular intervals. Upon intake, the system may prompt the clinician to administer baseline measures (like PHQ-9, GAD-7). Then it can auto-schedule these to repeat say every 4 weeks or at discharge. Aurora can also tie this to the treatment plan – e.g., if a goal is related to reducing depression, the PHQ-9 can be scheduled monthly until that goal’s target date. Reminders appear for clinicians or clients to fill these out when due.
- **Client Self-Report via Portal:** Many outcome measures are self-report questionnaires. Aurora leverages the Client Portal to have clients fill out measures electronically. Prior to a session, the client might get a notification: “Please complete the PHQ-9 questionnaire before your next appointment.” They can log in, fill it out (it’s essentially a special type of form), and submit. The results immediately become available to the clinician and are scored and plotted. This engages clients in their care and saves session time (though measures can also be done in-session collaboratively if preferred).
- **Clinician-Rated Scales:** Some measures are clinician-administered (like a mental status exam rating or a clinician-rated scale of functioning). Aurora allows clinicians to directly enter these in the outcome tracking section. It also supports **observer-reported outcomes** (e.g., a parent might fill a form about a child’s behavior). The system records who the responder is for each measure (self, clinician, parent, etc.) to maintain clarity.

**Outcome Dashboards and Graphs:** The power of collecting outcome data is in visualization and analysis:

- For each client, Aurora generates **graphs of their scores over time** for each measure used. If the client has completed PHQ-9 at intake, mid-treatment, and discharge, the system will plot those three points on a line graph so the clinician and client can easily see the change. Trends become very clear visually – e.g., a downward line indicates improvement on symptom severity. Below is an example of such a graph:

&#x20;_Figure: Example outcome tracking graph – PHQ-9 scores over successive sessions. In this illustrative chart, the client’s PHQ-9 depression score decreased from 18 (moderately severe) at intake to 7 (minimal) by session 8, indicating significant improvement. Aurora automatically plots these scores to provide clinicians and clients a tangible view of progress._

These graphs are accessible on the client’s profile (“Outcomes” tab) and can be printed or included in reports. Many clinicians use them in therapy to **provide feedback to clients** – a recognized best practice where seeing objective improvement can encourage clients. On the other hand, if outcomes are not improving, that’s a signal to adjust the treatment plan, intensify therapy, or consult.

- **Aggregate Outcomes:** Aurora also provides program-level outcome tracking. A product manager or clinical director can run reports like “average change in PHQ-9 scores from intake to discharge for all clients in the Depression Program” – useful for evaluating effectiveness. If an agency needs to report outcomes to funders or accrediting bodies, these analytics are readily available. For example, you could show that 85% of clients had a statistically significant improvement on GAD-7 after 12 weeks, which is powerful data for grants or quality improvement.
- **Outcome Alerts:** The system can generate alerts based on certain scores. For instance, if a client’s **suicide risk questionnaire** has a concerning response, the clinician and maybe a supervisor can be immediately alerted. Or if a normally stable client suddenly scores much worse on a depression scale, the system flags it so the clinician can follow up proactively. This integrates with the Notification Engine to support client safety and responsive care.
- **Clinical Use:** Outcome measures inform clinical decisions. For instance, objective measures provide **tangible evidence of progress**, which can guide conversations in supervision and treatment team meetings. If a measure isn’t showing improvement, the clinician might try a different approach. Conversely, if a client’s scores have been in the normal range for a while, it might indicate readiness for discharge. Aurora can facilitate these interpretations by providing **norms and benchmarks** – e.g., the PHQ-9 score interpretation is shown with each score, or it might highlight when a client’s score drops below the clinical cutoff (meaning they’re in remission).

**Integration with Notes and Plans:** As mentioned, outcome data doesn’t live in isolation. Clinicians can easily reference outcome scores in their progress notes (some even import the latest score into the note automatically). Treatment plan reviews pull in outcome data to objectively summarize progress toward goals. For example, a goal might be “reduce depression symptoms (PHQ-9 from 18 to <10)”; during review, the system shows the current PHQ-9 is 7【62†】, so the goal is achieved – that can auto-complete a suggestion that the goal be marked as met. This tight integration encourages a data-informed practice where subjective impressions and objective data meet.

**Use Case – Measuring Outcome in Therapy:** A therapist is treating a client with major depression. At intake, they administer a PHQ-9 and get a score of 18 (moderately severe depression). They set a goal to reduce this to below 10 (mild) over 3 months. Throughout treatment, the client completes the PHQ-9 every 2 weeks via the portal. Aurora plots the scores: 18 at intake, 15 at 2 weeks, 12 at 1 month, 10 at 2 months, 8 at 3 months. The graph clearly shows a downward trend. In sessions, the therapist sometimes shows this graph to the client to reinforce progress – _“You started at 18 and now you’re at 8; that’s a big improvement, your hard work is paying off!”_. At the 3-month treatment plan review, the outcome data supports concluding that this particular goal has been achieved. They may decide to focus on a new goal or prepare for discharge. Additionally, the therapist prints a simple progress report from Aurora for the client’s primary care doctor (with the client’s consent) – it includes the PHQ-9 trend showing improvement, which helps coordinate care with the PCP who prescribed medication. This kind of outcome tracking fosters a **measurement-informed care** approach.

**Regulatory and Funding Needs:** Many payers and state programs require demonstrating outcomes. For example, a state might mandate outcome measures at intake and discharge for all mental health clients to assess program effectiveness. Aurora’s outcome tracking simplifies compliance with these requirements. It can generate a **batch outcome report** for all clients discharged in a quarter with their intake vs discharge scores on required measures. This not only helps fulfill reporting obligations but can qualify the organization for incentives under value-based programs (for instance, under MIPS, providers are rewarded for tracking and improving quality measures). The platform’s ability to reliably collect and report this data gives organizations a leg up in the era of accountable care.

In conclusion, Aurora’s combined Notes and Outcome Tracking capabilities ensure that **qualitative and quantitative aspects of care are both captured**. Clinicians have an easy-to-use system to document therapy sessions thoroughly and efficiently. At the same time, the platform automatically collects outcome data that provide **tangible evidence of progress**, aligning with best practices and payer expectations that care effectiveness be measured. Product managers can highlight that this dual-focus on documentation and outcomes means Aurora not only helps with day-to-day clinical work but also with demonstrating the value of the services provided – a key consideration for modern healthcare.

## Client Journey and 360° Client View

Aurora provides a **360-degree view of each client**, effectively creating a one-stop hub for all information and activity throughout the client’s care journey. This holistic view is critical for product managers to understand because it’s where the integration of all modules truly shines – it brings together intake data, consents, plans, session notes, communications, outcomes, and more into a coherent narrative of the client’s progress. In this section, we explain how Aurora tracks the client’s journey from the moment they enter the system (referral/intake) all the way through to discharge and outcomes, and how that information is organized for maximum insight. We’ll also cover how this comprehensive client view supports coordinated care and decision-making.

### 360° Client Profile Overview

At the core of the client journey is the **Client Profile**. When you open a client’s profile in Aurora, you are presented with a dashboard-like interface that summarizes key details and provides tabs or sections for deeper information. Here’s what you can expect in a typical client profile:

- **Header with Demographics:** At a glance, the top of the profile shows the client’s name, photo (if uploaded), age, gender, contact information, and maybe a few key identifiers (like client ID, insurance status, primary clinician). It will also indicate status (active, discharged) and any critical alerts (for example, an allergy or a safety alert like “flight risk” might be flagged prominently).
- **Summary Cards:** Often, there are summary cards or panels. For example:

  - _Next Appointment:_ date/time of the next scheduled session.
  - _Plan Status:_ whether a current treatment plan is in place and when it’s due for review.
  - _Outcomes Snapshot:_ perhaps a mini-chart of one key outcome measure (e.g., PHQ-9 last score and change from baseline).
  - _Balance:_ if billing is integrated, maybe a quick view of account balance or sessions remaining (if limited).
  - _Last Note:_ the date of the last progress note and who authored it, to know when they were last seen/documented.

- **Tabs for Details:** Below the summary, you have multiple tabs/sections:

  - **Details / Profile Info:** Detailed demographics, insurance, emergency contacts, primary care physician, medications (if tracked), etc. This is basically the client’s face sheet.
  - **Appointments:** A list or calendar view of all past and upcoming appointments for the client, including whether they were attended, missed, or cancelled.
  - **Forms & Documents:** All submitted forms (intake questionnaires, consents, screening tools) and uploaded documents (like external reports, ID copies, etc.) in one place. This acts as a digital file cabinet. Each item is labeled (e.g., “Intake Packet – submitted 01/05/2025”).
  - **Treatment Plans / Cases:** A section listing the active treatment plan(s) and historical plans (perhaps as expandable items with key goals). One can click to view the full plan.
  - **Progress Notes:** All clinical notes in reverse chronological order. They can be filtered by type. Each entry shows the date, author, type, and maybe a one-line summary (like the note title or first line). Clicking opens the full note.
  - **Outcomes:** Graphs and tables of outcome measures. Perhaps one sub-tab per measure or a consolidated view. It highlights changes over time.
  - **Tasks/Alerts:** Any open tasks related to the client (e.g., “Follow up call to client,” “Send satisfaction survey”) and any system alerts (like “Consent expiring” or “No show on 3/10, needs reschedule”).
  - **Messaging:** If the system has secure messaging, this might show message threads between client and provider or internal team messages about the client.
  - **Collaterals/Contacts:** A list of other people involved in the case (family members, other providers, school contacts) with their info and any consent status for communicating with them.

Essentially, the 360° view means at any point a clinician or case manager can see **everything that is going on with the client in one interface**. There’s no need to open multiple systems or modules separately – the integrations ensure that the data flows into this unified presentation.

### Tracking the Client Journey Timeline

One of Aurora’s visualization features is a **Client Timeline**. This is a chronological feed of significant events in the client’s journey. It might look like a vertical timeline with date markers, showing events such as:

- _Jan 5, 2025 – Intake Completed_ (with an icon indicating forms completed)
- _Jan 6, 2025 – Initial Assessment Note by Dr. Smith_ (with a note icon, clickable to read summary)
- _Jan 6, 2025 – Treatment Plan Created (v1)_
- _Jan 10, 2025 – First Session Attended_ (with note link)
- _Jan 20, 2025 – PHQ-9 completed: score 15_
- _Feb 2, 2025 – Missed Appointment_ (flagged in red perhaps)
- _Feb 10, 2025 – Case Review Meeting (case note)_
- _Feb 15, 2025 – Treatment Plan v2 (updated goals)_
- _Mar 10, 2025 – PHQ-9 completed: score 8_
- _Mar 15, 2025 – Discharge Summary Note_
- _Mar 20, 2025 – Case Closed / Outcome: Depression in remission_

This timeline (often visually scrolling) is extremely useful for case reviews and for quickly orienting any user (especially new team members) to what has happened with the client so far. It provides context at a glance – e.g., one can see frequency of sessions, when key changes were made, how outcomes have changed alongside interventions, etc. It indeed gives that narrative flow of the client’s treatment journey from intake to outcome.

Aurora’s timeline is interactive: clicking on any event jumps to the detailed record (open that note, open that plan, etc.). Users can filter it (show only critical events or only a certain type like forms and outcomes, etc.). This is much more efficient than hunting through different sections manually.

### Coordinated Care and Team Collaboration

The 360° view is not just for an individual clinician – it supports **team-based care**. In many settings, multiple professionals (therapists, psychiatrists, case managers, nurses, etc.) may be involved with one client. Aurora’s centralized client journey ensures everyone with permission sees the same information and updates in real-time. Some features supporting coordination:

- **Team Assignments:** Each client can have a care team assigned (e.g., primary therapist, prescriber, care coordinator). These are listed in the profile. Team members get notifications of key events. If a case manager adds a note that the client lost housing, the therapist sees that update and can incorporate it next session.
- **Internal Notes/Comments:** There are capabilities for internal case comments or hand-off notes (that might not be part of the formal record). For example, after a phone call, a case manager might leave an FYI note: “Client is going through a divorce, might be in heightened distress; informed therapist.” These internal communications can be tagged and kept in a way that doesn’t clutter official progress notes but still informs care.
- **Visibility Controls:** Not all info is for everyone – Aurora allows tagging notes or data as sensitive (e.g., a therapist’s personal psychotherapy note that is separate from the official record, or certain confidential pieces of info). Product managers can configure roles such that, say, only clinicians see psychotherapy notes, while case managers see case-related data. However, all authorized team members have a shared view of the relevant data, which is crucial for integrated care settings.
- **Client Engagement:** The client journey isn’t just visible to providers – clients themselves can be given a version of this in the portal. Aurora’s portal might show a client their own progress (like outcome graphs), upcoming tasks (like “complete this survey”), and even parts of their record (some agencies let clients read their treatment plans or even notes). This level of transparency can improve engagement and trust. For example, a client could log in and see: “We are here in your journey – you have completed 8 of 12 sessions; your depression score improved by 10 points; your next treatment plan review is in 2 weeks, etc.” It essentially can function like a personal progress dashboard for the client, which is quite empowering.

**Use Case – Coordinated Care Example:** Consider a scenario: a client is receiving therapy, medication management, and has a case manager for employment support. After an appointment, the psychiatrist updates the medication and writes a psychiatry progress note (which includes the med changes and some observations). The therapist, before the next therapy session, opens the client’s profile and sees on the timeline “Medication changed – new dosage of Zoloft as of Sep 10”. They click to quickly skim the psychiatrist’s note. Armed with that info, the therapist in session can ask how the client is adjusting to the new dose. Meanwhile, the case manager looks at outcomes and sees the client’s anxiety scores are dropping; they post a quick internal comment: “Great progress on anxiety, which might help in job search confidence.” The therapist sees that comment and during session, also encourages the client’s progress in context of job seeking. This synergy is enabled by the platform’s integrated design – every piece of the puzzle is accessible to the team, forming a true 360° view of care.

### From Intake to Outcome

To tie it all together, let’s narratively walk through the full client journey in Aurora from start to finish:

1. **Referral/Intake:** A referral is entered (maybe via a custom referral form as described earlier) – the client’s profile is created. Intake paperwork is sent electronically, completed, and automatically attached. The intake coordinator schedules the initial assessment. All this initial data (referral reason, intake forms) is visible in the profile for the assessor to review beforehand.
2. **Initial Assessment:** The clinician conducts and documents an initial evaluation note, capturing baseline clinical info. They also administer baseline outcome measures (perhaps PHQ-9, GAD-7) through Aurora; scores are recorded. The clinician drafts a treatment plan. All these appear on the timeline and are accessible.
3. **Active Treatment:** As sessions commence, each session’s notes are added. The client’s journey timeline starts filling out. If the client misses a session, a note is made or an event is logged (“no-show”). If any crisis happened and an emergency contact was engaged, that’s documented too. Over weeks, outcome measures are periodically taken. The system is tracking those and maybe showing mini alerts like “depression symptoms decreasing” when viewing the outcome tab. The treatment plan might be updated mid-course (which is a notable event on the timeline). Through it all, notifications ensure nothing is forgotten (consents updated, plans reviewed, etc.).
4. **Collaboration & External Data:** Suppose the client also sees an external psychiatrist – the team might upload the psychiatrist’s consult notes or at least record that they changed a medication. That document goes into the documents section with date and context. Everything is filed.
5. **Review & Adjust:** Every so often, the clinical team meets to discuss the case (the system might have a Case Conference note type for that). They pull up the 360° view – seeing the latest outcomes, recent note summaries, current goals. This comprehensive perspective lets them make informed adjustments. For example, seeing that anxiety isn’t improving while depression is, they might tweak the plan to focus more on anxiety coping.
6. **Approaching Outcome:** As the client improves (or after a set number of sessions), the clinician administers final outcome measures. The graphs now show stark improvement – for instance, an improvement on a functional assessment from “High need” to “Low need”. This is recorded. If the outcome is not favorable (e.g., no change), that’s also clearly visible, prompting consideration of next steps (maybe referral to a higher level of care).
7. **Discharge:** When it’s time to close the case (successful completion or otherwise), a discharge summary is written. In Aurora, the discharge summary pulls in key data automatically: it can list the number of sessions attended, initial and final outcome scores, goals achieved or not achieved, and any recommendations. This provides a final narrative of the journey. The client’s status is set to discharged (but data remains for future re-engagement if needed). The timeline’s final entries might be “Outcomes at discharge” and “Discharge summary completed”.
8. **Post-Care Follow-up:** If the organization does follow-ups (like a 3-month post-discharge check-in or a satisfaction survey), Aurora can track that too – a task might be set for a follow-up call, or a survey link sent. If the client returns later, their old journey is there to review, and a new episode can begin without losing continuity— the multiplan and multi-case capability allows starting a new chapter while retaining the historical chapter.

This end-to-end tracking ensures **no part of the client’s story is lost**. It provides accountability (e.g., anyone can audit a case and see exactly what happened when), continuity (new staff can get up to speed quickly by reviewing the profile), and insight (correlating interventions with outcomes, understanding the sequence of events that led to improvement or crises).

From a product management standpoint, the 360° client view is a major selling point. Many systems have lots of features but fail to present them in a unified way, forcing users to piece together info. Aurora’s approach aligns with the concept of a “Patient 360” that healthcare IT experts advocate for improved care coordination. By implementing this holistic view, Aurora helps clinicians deliver **client-centered care** where the client’s journey is clearly mapped and can be easily shared among the care team. It also sets the stage for advanced analytics down the line (like identifying patterns across client journeys to improve programs).

In essence, the Client Journey module ensures that from **intake to outcome, every step is documented, accessible, and actionable**. It’s the living story of the client within Aurora, and it epitomizes the integration of all the product’s capabilities to serve one goal: better client outcomes and experiences.

## Notifications and Dashboards

Aurora is equipped with intelligent **Notifications** and intuitive **Dashboards** that together form the command center for users to stay on top of their responsibilities and the organization’s pulse. Notifications ensure that nothing important is overlooked by automatically alerting staff to critical events and upcoming tasks. Dashboards provide at-a-glance insights into operations, caseloads, and outcomes through visualizations and summary data. In this section, we detail how the notification system works and the types of dashboards available, and how these tools enhance productivity and oversight for product managers and end-users alike.

### Notification Engine – Alerts and Reminders

Aurora’s notification engine continuously monitors the data in the system and sends out **alerts, reminders, and confirmations** based on predefined rules and triggers. Notifications can be delivered in-app (visible as a bell icon counter or pop-up in Aurora’s interface), via email, or via SMS (for certain client-facing reminders), depending on user preferences and the type of alert. They are essential for ensuring timely action and helping users prioritize their workflow.

Here are key scenarios and features of Aurora’s notifications:

- **Appointment Reminders:** Perhaps the most straightforward – clients can receive automated reminders of upcoming appointments (e.g., 24 hours and 1 hour before). These can reduce no-shows significantly. Staff can also get notifications if a client confirms or cancels through the portal.
- **Task Reminders:** If a user sets a task or the system generates one (e.g., “Complete treatment plan review for Client X by Oct 30”), the assigned user will get a reminder as the due date approaches. After completion, notifications can cease or confirm completion.
- **Compliance Alerts:** The system generates alerts for compliance-related deadlines. For instance, “Treatment Plan for Client Y is due for update in 5 days” or “Annual Consent for Client Z has expired” – these keep clinicians and admins ahead of regulatory requirements. A dashboard widget might show how many plans are due soon, but notifications directly prod the responsible person. Another example: if a progress note wasn’t written within, say, 24 hours of a session (per policy), a reminder could be sent to the clinician to complete their documentation.
- **Risk Alerts:** Aurora’s integration of outcomes and data means it can send critical alerts. If a client answers “yes” on a suicide ideation question on a survey, an urgent alert can be sent to the clinician and perhaps escalated to a supervisor if needed. Similarly, if a client hasn’t been seen in a long time and is at risk of dropping out, a notification might prompt outreach.
- **Informational Notifications:** These could include “Client A completed the intake forms” or “New message from Client B” or “Lab results uploaded for Client C” (if integrated with labs). They keep the relevant staff informed of new developments.
- **Custom Triggers:** Product managers or admins can set custom notification rules. For example, if a clinic wants an alert whenever a caseload exceeds a certain number, or if a client’s satisfaction survey comes back with low scores, the system can be configured to notify specific roles. Aurora’s rules engine allows triggers like: _When \[Condition] occurs, send \[Notification] to \[User/Role]_.
- **Escalation and Snooze:** Notifications can have escalation paths – e.g., if an alert is not acknowledged within X time, escalate it to someone else or send via another channel. Users can also snooze certain notifications if appropriate (like, remind me again in 3 days if still relevant). This ensures urgent issues are handled promptly, while less urgent ones can be managed thoughtfully.
- **Client Notifications:** Not to be forgotten, clients too get notifications via the system: upcoming appointments (as mentioned), a reminder to fill out a survey or form, a message that a document is available (like “Your treatment plan has been uploaded for you to review”), or group announcements (for example, “Reminder: DBT Group will meet via telehealth this week”). These improve client engagement and self-management.

All notifications are logged – one can see what was sent and whether, for instance, a client confirmed an appointment via the reminder link. This auditing can be useful for quality improvement (e.g., tracking that reminders reduced no-shows by X%).

From a user perspective, the notification center in Aurora helps them **manage their day**. A clinician logging in might see: 3 new notifications – perhaps one telling them a client completed a PHQ-9 (so they should review it), one reminding them to sign yesterday’s note, and one that their supervision meeting is at 2 PM. This means they don’t have to remember everything themselves or constantly check various parts of the system – Aurora proactively brings the info to them.

### Dashboards and Analytics

Aurora’s Dashboard feature provides **visual dashboards** tailored for different user roles – giving an overview of key performance indicators (KPIs), workload, and alerts in a digestible format. Dashboards are configurable but typically there are a few default types:

- **Clinician Dashboard:** When a therapist or clinician logs in, they may see a dashboard of their caseload and tasks. For example:

  - Number of **active clients** on their caseload and maybe how many were seen this week vs how many have not been seen in over 2 weeks (prompting follow-up).
  - Upcoming appointments for today or the next few days.
  - Notifications requiring action (e.g., “2 notes need signing”, “1 treatment plan due”). Possibly shown as colored counters.
  - Outcomes overview: e.g., a chart of average improvement across their clients or highlighting any clients whose scores have worsened (to pay attention).
  - If involved in group programs, maybe group attendance or other measures.
  - Some systems also show a **compliance scorecard** on dashboards: for instance, percentage of one’s clients with current treatment plans, or documentation completion rate. This gamifies and incentivizes keeping things up to date.

  Essentially, the clinician dashboard helps a provider quickly see **what needs my attention right now** and **how am I doing with my clients overall**. By presenting data like who’s overdue for contact or which plans are expiring, it guides daily priorities and ensures proactive care. As one resource analogized, a dashboard is like a gas gauge in your car – showing you at a glance if you’re low on anything crucial.

- **Supervisor/Program Manager Dashboard:** For those overseeing a team or program, dashboards aggregate data at a higher level. For instance:

  - **Caseload Overview:** Each clinician’s caseload number, presented perhaps in a bar graph. This can highlight if someone has too many or too few clients relative to others, or track capacity usage (e.g., Dr. Smith is at 90% capacity, Ms. Jones at 60%).
  - **Documentation Compliance:** A widget might show number of unsigned notes, overdue treatment plans, etc., for the entire team or by clinician. A supervisor can quickly see if anyone is falling behind on paperwork so they can intervene.
  - **Client Engagement Metrics:** e.g., overall no-show rate for the program, percentage of clients who completed outcome measures this month, average length of treatment, discharge reasons summary (how many completed vs dropped out). These metrics help in quality improvement and ensuring standards are met.
  - **Risk & Incidents:** Possibly a section showing any critical incidents or high-risk alerts in the past week (for example, 2 safety concerns flagged).
  - **Outcomes Summary:** Maybe a chart of average symptom score change across all clients in the program, or distribution of outcomes (like how many improved, stayed same, worsened). This is powerful for seeing the effectiveness of services.
  - **Financial/Billing Shortcuts:** If relevant to the role, maybe a quick stat on billed sessions vs attended, etc., but since our focus is more clinical, this might be minimal on a clinical manager’s dashboard.

This supervisory dashboard acts as a **flight control** – the manager can spot issues (like a therapist consistently having many no-shows or a particular group not showing good outcomes) and address them. It promotes accountability as well; if one sees that their team’s treatment plan completion rate is 100%, that’s great, but if it’s 70%, they know to push efforts there.

- **Executive or Administrator Dashboard:** At the highest level, Aurora can provide an **executive summary** dashboard. This might encompass:

  - **Census and Utilization:** How many clients served, how many new intakes, discharges, active cases, etc., perhaps trending over time or compared to last period.
  - **Outcomes & Quality:** Maybe an aggregate of outcome achievements (e.g., “75% of discharged clients showed improvement in at least one outcome metric”).
  - **Provider Capacity & Productivity:** Summary of services delivered (sessions held, groups held), maybe broken by program, to identify productivity and capacity utilization trends.
  - **Client Satisfaction:** If satisfaction surveys are in use, an average score or NPS (Net Promoter Score) could be displayed.
  - **Compliance & Operations:** Items like documentation compliance across the org, any major incidents, and possibly financial metrics like revenue, but that might be outside the immediate scope.
  - **State Reporting Status:** If they have to submit monthly state reports, a status indicator (submitted vs due). Also could show outcome metrics needed by state, such as percentage of clients with improved functioning, etc., aligning with state KPIs.

This high-level dashboard helps leadership ensure the organization is meeting its targets (clinical and operational) and can be used in board meetings or stakeholder reports. It compiles the data that comes from all the daily work into strategic information.

**Visualization:** Aurora’s dashboards use charts (bar, line, pie charts), gauges, and tables to visualize data. They emphasize clarity – using color-coding for attention (e.g., red for overdue or below target metrics, green for on-track). They update in real-time or near-real-time (some might update daily if heavy computation is needed).

Crucially, the dashboards are **interactive** – clicking a widget can drill down to the underlying list. For instance, clicking “5 treatment plans overdue” might open the list of those plans and whose caseload they’re on, so a manager can follow up directly. This drill-down capability connects the bird’s-eye view to ground-level action.

**Customization:** Not every organization values the same metrics, so Aurora allows customization of dashboards. Users can often choose which widgets to display, resize them, or even have multiple tabs of dashboards (e.g., a Quality tab vs a Productivity tab). The system might come with a library of available widgets and an admin can set a default layout for certain roles. For example, a CCBHC (Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic) might configure a dashboard with the specific measures they must report for that program, such as number of clients receiving certain services, certain outcome improvements, etc.

**Value of Dashboards:** A well-implemented dashboard can _dramatically improve situational awareness_. Instead of combing through reports or manually tracking KPIs, users have key information presented to them every time they log in. It “gives EHR users specific snapshots of data that illustrate the health or status of a given area of your operation” – be it a clinician’s caseload health or the organization’s performance. The real-time nature means decisions can be data-driven and timely. For instance, if a certain program’s referrals suddenly dip (and it shows on a trend line), outreach can be boosted immediately rather than discovering it months later. Or if a clinician’s outcomes are consistently not improving, a supervisor can intervene sooner.

**Use Case – Dashboard in Action:** A clinical director starts her day by checking the Aurora dashboard. She notices on her Program Dashboard that the **average time from referral to first appointment** has crept up to 15 days, whereas their target is 10. One look at the **Census & Utilization** widget shows an influx of new referrals this month without a matching increase in admissions – possibly a bottleneck. She drills down and finds that one clinic location has a waitlist due to a therapist out on leave. With this insight, she reallocates a part-time clinician to pick up assessments at that location for the next few weeks, which will bring that wait time down. Without the dashboard, this delay might have gone unnoticed until complaints arose; with it, she can proactively manage resources. Similarly, she sees the **Outcomes Overview** indicating 60% of clients improved in anxiety scores which is good, but 10% worsened. She clicks that to see which clients worsened – it turns out a particular group therapy is included, she then discusses with those facilitators if changes in group composition or approach are needed. Meanwhile, therapists are using their personal dashboards – one sees he has an alert that 3 of his clients have not been seen in over a month. He reaches out to them, successfully re-engaging two who had transportation issues (switching them to telehealth resolves it). These small interventions, guided by the system’s notifications and dashboards, result in better overall service delivery.

In summary, **Notifications and Dashboards form Aurora’s proactive workflow management system**. Notifications act like a smart assistant, constantly scanning for issues and deadlines and nudging users at just the right time – ensuring critical tasks are handled and clients don’t fall through the cracks. Dashboards serve as an intelligent control panel, giving each user the information they need to do their job effectively, from micro (today’s tasks) to macro (program outcomes). Together, they enhance both **efficiency (do the right things at the right time)** and **effectiveness (focus on what matters for better outcomes)**, making the platform not just a passive record system but an active partner in managing care.

## Provider Capacity Management and State Reporting

The final focus area of Aurora addresses two crucial administrative domains: **managing provider capacity** (i.e., understanding and balancing the workload on clinicians and resources) and **generating reports for state and regulatory compliance**. These features are particularly important for large organizations and publicly funded programs where oversight, funding, and accountability are tied to provider utilization and adherence to mandated reporting. In this section, we explore how Aurora helps analyze provider capacity, and how it simplifies the complex demands of state reporting and compliance documentation.

### Provider Capacity and Workload Analysis

Ensuring that providers are neither overburdened nor underutilized is key to both staff well-being and efficient service delivery. Aurora includes tools to monitor and analyze provider capacity:

- **Caseload Tracking:** The system tracks the number of active clients assigned to each provider. As new clients are admitted or discharged, caseload counts update. A supervisor can view a table or chart of all clinicians and their active caseload numbers. If one therapist has 40 clients and another has 15, that discrepancy is immediately evident. Caseload can also be weighed by intensity (for example, a client in intensive services might count as more than 1 in a simple count, so some organizations use a weighted score). Aurora allows setting a preferred caseload range (e.g., 25-30 clients per therapist) and can flag if someone exceeds it. This info is often summarized on management dashboards as described earlier.

- **Scheduling and Availability:** Beyond just number of clients, Aurora looks at the **appointment schedule** to gauge utilization. It can calculate, for each provider, what percentage of their available hours are booked with client appointments. For instance, a psychiatrist might have 30 available slots a week and is booking 25 on average (approx 83% utilization). Another might be only 50% booked, indicating capacity to take more clients or more duties. These stats might be shown in a capacity report with green/yellow/red highlighting for optimal vs under/over capacity.

- **Service Units Provided:** Aurora can report on how many sessions or service hours each provider has conducted in a given period. This helps identify productivity patterns. For example, if the expected standard is 20 sessions per week and a therapist consistently does 15, that may prompt inquiry (are they spending more time on paperwork, or are they dealing with no-shows?). Conversely, a consistently high number might indicate a heavy load or perhaps inefficiencies elsewhere allowing them to over-deliver. Productivity reports can be a sensitive topic, but Aurora provides data in a factual manner which can be used constructively in supervision to balance workloads and set realistic expectations.

- **Waitlists and Capacity Planning:** If an organization uses waitlists for services, Aurora’s capacity tools can integrate that. For instance, it may show that Therapist A has 5 people waiting (because their specialty or language skill is in high demand), whereas Therapist B has no waitlist. This can inform hiring or training decisions (e.g., cross-train another staff in that specialty to alleviate wait times). It could also influence scheduling (maybe open an extra group session if many are waiting for one). Aurora can simulate capacity scenarios too – for example, if a new clinician is added with X availability, how many waitlisted clients could be scheduled.

- **Provider Utilization Dashboard:** A specialized dashboard might exist for a clinic director that shows something like a bar chart of each clinician’s % of slots filled this month, average session count, and maybe outcomes correlation. For instance, it might highlight if high caseload correlates with lower client improvement (maybe suggesting burnout), which could prompt action. Also, a **provider management dashboard** can include things like upcoming license expiration reminders (keeping track of when each clinician’s license or certification expires, to remind for renewal – part of compliance for provider credentials).

- **Management of Provider Assignments:** Aurora makes it easy to reassign or share cases when dealing with capacity. If a clinician is at capacity, new intakes might be automatically assigned to another with availability (the system can suggest this). If a clinician goes on leave, a supervisor can bulk transfer their appointments or cases to colleagues and Aurora will notify those colleagues of the assignment changes. This reduces administrative hassle during such re-balancing.

The ultimate goal is to use data to **ensure clients get seen in a timely manner while not overwhelming providers**. With Aurora’s insights, a product manager can identify when to hire additional staff, how to redistribute caseloads, or even when to close intakes for a program temporarily if capacity is maxed (and conversely, when there is slack capacity prompting increased referrals or program marketing).

**Real-world example:** If Aurora shows that evenings have high demand but only 2 clinicians offer evening hours, the agency might arrange for another clinician to shift their schedule to an evening to meet capacity. Or if it shows a particular clinician is consistently underbooked, perhaps they could serve another program’s clients or the schedule system might need tweaking. This data-driven approach to workload management helps maintain quality of care and staff morale (since overload can lead to burnout).

Additionally, for grant-funded programs, provider capacity metrics are often part of grant reports (like staff-to-client ratios). Aurora can generate those specific stats easily.

### State and Regulatory Reporting

Behavioral health providers often face a daunting array of **state reporting requirements** – often described as an “alphabet soup” of programs and forms (Medi-Cal, DARMHA, OMS, etc., depending on the state). Aurora significantly eases this burden by having built-in reporting tools that gather required data and format it according to various mandates.

Key aspects of Aurora’s state reporting capabilities include:

- **Pre-configured Reports:** Aurora comes with a suite of standard reports for common state requirements. For instance:

  - Monthly/Quarterly service delivery reports (how many clients served, how many services provided, broken down by demographic categories, etc.).
  - Outcome measure reports for state outcomes systems (some states require submission of certain scales at intake and discharge; Aurora can output a file or online submission that meets those specs).
  - Compliance audits like restraint/seclusion incident tallies, if relevant to that setting, or critical incident reports.
  - Medicaid encounter data – if a program must report all billable encounters in a certain format, Aurora can compile those from the EHR data.
    In some systems, these come as pre-built templates that align with state systems such as **Oklahoma ODMHSAS reporting, Texas CMBHS, Oregon’s MOTS**, etc., to name hypothetical examples.

- **Configurable Data Fields for State Needs:** Often, state reporting requires capturing specific data fields not always used internally. Aurora has the flexibility to capture and store those fields. For example, a state might require a “Consumer ID” or funding source code for each service – Aurora can maintain those values per client or per service. Another example: certain programs require tracking of housing status or employment status at intake/discharge; Aurora can prompt users to enter those at the necessary times so that the data set is complete for reporting. Essentially, it ensures **Federal, State, and Local compliance** data points are integrated into the workflow.

- **Automated Report Generation and Submission:** Instead of staff manually compiling spreadsheets each month, Aurora can generate the report in one click. It pulls all relevant data (which has been entered over the course of care) and populates the report. Reports can often be exported in multiple formats (Excel, CSV, XML, etc.). If the state system allows electronic upload, Aurora can produce the exact format needed. Some advanced integrations even allow API submission directly from Aurora to the state’s database, if available. A highlight here is that Aurora’s team monitors changes in state requirements and updates the report templates accordingly via updates, so the organization stays in compliance with minimal effort – reflecting the philosophy of taking the development and maintenance of state reports off the provider’s shoulders.

- **Examples of State Reporting Functions:**

  - _CCBHC (Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic) reporting:_ These clinics must report on a standardized set of measures (like depression remission rates, follow-up after hospitalization, etc.). Aurora can aggregate those measures from its outcomes and scheduling data and produce the required report for SAMHSA or state authorities.
  - _HCBS Waivers and Programs:_ Tracking attendance and outcomes for Home- and Community-Based Services waivers often requires detail. Aurora’s features, as mentioned in Zkare’s highlights, include managing those program enrollments and generating specific reports.
  - _Electronic Visit Verification (EVV):_ For services delivered in homes (like certain Medicaid services), EVV is required federally – which means capturing the GPS location and time of service via a mobile app. Aurora’s mobile app can handle EVV (the staff check-in and check-out with location stamps), and then a report of EVV records can be produced to comply with the 21st Century Cures Act EVV mandate.

- **Management of Reporting Schedules:** Aurora keeps track of when certain reports are due. For example, it knows that by the 10th of each month, the previous month’s data must be reported for a particular state contract. It can send a reminder to the compliance officer or automatically generate the report for review on the 1st of the month. This scheduling avoids the “oops, we forgot to submit that quarterly report” scenarios.

- **Audit Trails and Validation:** The system validates data before compiling reports. It might alert: “5 clients are missing ethnicity data required for the annual report” so staff can fill it in before report generation. And when a report is generated, Aurora can log exactly which data was included. If auditors later question figures, one can trace back to client records easily. This transparency is crucial because state reporting is high-stakes; errors can lead to funding issues or penalties. Aurora’s reliability in this domain is a big selling point – it **supports a system that is used by states and local government** by aligning with their established processes.

**Benefits of Integrated State Reporting:**

- **Reduced Administrative Burden:** Without Aurora, agencies often have staff spending many hours manually collecting and formatting data for reports. Aurora automates much of this – “sharing the burden of essential compliance details through state reporting” – so staff can focus on care rather than paperwork.
- **Accuracy:** Manual data aggregation can introduce errors. With Aurora, the data comes straight from the source (the EHR entries), reducing transcription errors. If the data in the system is accurate (which it is for clinical use), then the report will be accurate – a big confidence booster for compliance managers.
- **Timeliness:** Reports can be generated quickly and submitted on time. This prevents lapses that could jeopardize contracts.
- **Demonstrating Value:** State reports aren’t just bureaucratic hoops; they often contain valuable information about outcomes and performance. By efficiently producing them, agencies can also useBy efficiently producing these required reports, agencies not only stay compliant but can leverage the data to **demonstrate program effectiveness and value** to stakeholders – often resulting in financial incentives or continued funding under value-based payment models. In short, **Aurora’s state reporting tools remove the stress from compliance**. The platform “takes the burden off you by handling essential compliance requirements”, empowering organizations to focus on quality care rather than paperwork.
