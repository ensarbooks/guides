Great. I will prepare a comprehensive 200-page requirements document for developing a Jira-like project management application tailored for software teams. This document will focus on core modules such as issue tracking, sprint planning, backlog management, reporting, user roles, and third-party integrations. It will include detailed functional and non-functional requirements, and be structured for clarity and implementation use.

I’ll let you know as soon as the document is ready for your review.

# Project Management Application Requirements Specification

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a **Jira-like project management application** tailored for software development teams. It outlines detailed functional and non-functional requirements for key modules including issue tracking, backlog grooming, sprint planning, agile board management, user roles and permissions, reporting/analytics, notifications, and integrations with development tools. The goal is to define a comprehensive feature set and quality benchmarks to guide the design and implementation of a robust agile project management system. This application is intended to support teams following Scrum or Kanban methodologies, providing end-to-end visibility and control over the software development lifecycle.

**Scope:** The system will serve as a central platform for planning, tracking, and managing software work items (e.g. user stories, tasks, bugs, etc.). It will facilitate collaboration among roles such as developers, QA, product owners, and project managers. The requirements cover core functionality (creating and tracking issues, managing backlogs and sprints, etc.) as well as cross-cutting concerns like usability, performance, scalability, and security. Any UI design specifics or implementation details are outside the scope of this document, except where necessary to explain a requirement. Integration with external services (code repositories, messaging apps, CI/CD pipelines) is in scope to ensure the tool fits into a modern DevOps ecosystem. This specification does **not** include detailed UI wireframes or low-level design, focusing instead on **what** the system must do (the requirements) rather than **how** to implement it.

**Intended Audience:** This document is written for product managers, software architects, and development teams responsible for building the application. It will also be useful for stakeholders and potential users to understand the system’s capabilities. Throughout, we provide use case examples and diagrams to illustrate how the system should behave in context.

## System Overview

The project management application is a web-based system with a modular architecture. Major functional modules include Issue Management, Backlog & Sprint Management, Agile Board, Reporting, Notifications, and Integrations. The system will support multiple projects and teams concurrently, with configurable settings per project (such as workflows and permissions). At a high level, users interact with the system via a web UI (and possibly a REST API for integrations). The application stores data (projects, issues, users, etc.) in a central database, and integrates with external tools to streamline the development workflow.

_Figure: High-level context diagram of the Project Management Application and its integrations._ The system will integrate with developer tools like version control repositories (e.g. GitHub), communication channels (e.g. Slack), and CI/CD pipelines. For example, it should be possible to link code commits and pull requests to tracking issues, or receive notifications of issue updates in a team chat channel. By integrating with code repositories, teams can achieve **real-time issue tracking and smoother development workflows** ([Integrate Jira with GitHub: Streamline Collaboration & Project Management](https://everhour.com/blog/integrate-github-and-jira/#:~:text=By%20integrating%20GitHub%20with%20Jira%2C,to%20set%20up%20this%20integration)), reducing manual effort and context-switching between tools. All user interactions (issue updates, board changes, etc.) go through the application’s business logic, which enforces rules and updates the database. External systems may push events into the application (e.g. a Git commit triggers an issue transition via webhook) or pull data via the API.

Key design considerations for the system include: support for agile processes (Scrum/Kanban), real-time collaboration (multiple users updating data simultaneously), and high scalability to accommodate enterprise use (many projects, thousands of users). Non-functional aspects such as performance, security, and usability are equally critical and are detailed in later sections. In the following sections, each major module’s requirements are described in detail.

## Functional Requirements

This section enumerates the functional requirements for the application, organized by major feature area. Each subsection describes the capabilities the system **must** provide, along with specific scenarios and acceptance criteria. The requirements use the keyword "shall" to indicate a mandatory requirement.

### 1. Issue Tracking

Issue Tracking is the core module that allows users to create, view, update, and manage work items (often called “issues” or “tickets”). An issue can represent a user story, task, bug, or any unit of work. This module underpins all other features (backlog, sprints, boards) by providing the database of work items and their status in the development lifecycle.

**1.1 Issue Creation and Fields:** The system shall allow users to create a new issue with relevant metadata. At minimum, an issue contains:

- **Title/Summary:** A short one-line summary of the issue.
- **Description:** A detailed description (rich text or Markdown supported) for requirements or steps to reproduce (for bugs).
- **Issue Type:** Category such as Bug, Feature, Task, Story, Epic, etc. (The system shall support multiple issue types).
- **Priority/Severity:** Indicator of importance (e.g. P1, P2, High, Medium, Low).
- **Status:** The current workflow state (e.g. Open, In Progress, In Review, Done – see **Issue Workflow** below).
- **Assignee:** The user currently responsible for the issue.
- **Reporter:** The user who filed/created the issue.
- **Tags/Labels:** Arbitrary labels for grouping or filtering (e.g. component or subsystem tags).
- **Attachments:** Ability to attach files (screenshots, documents) to an issue.
- **Due Date:** (Optional) a date by which the issue should be resolved (useful for time-bound tasks).
- **Estimation:** For tasks/stories, a field for estimated effort (e.g. story points in Scrum, or time estimate).
- **Custom Fields:** The system shall allow defining custom fields (text, number, dropdown, etc.) at the project level to capture additional metadata as needed.

When creating an issue, only the Title and Issue Type are required by default; other fields can be filled or updated later. The system shall provide a rich text editor for the Description to enhance clarity (for example, to include code snippets or images in a bug report). Users should be able to **search and select existing values** where applicable (e.g. assign to a user from the team, select a label from existing tags). After creation, each issue is assigned a unique identifier (e.g. a project key plus number like PROJ-100) for reference.

**1.2 Issue Viewing and Editing:** Users shall be able to view an issue’s details on a dedicated issue page or dialog. This view must display all fields and metadata, including a history of changes. The history should log key events (created, status changes, field edits, comments, etc.) with timestamp and user information for auditing. The issue view shall also show:

- **Comments Thread:** Users can comment on issues for discussions, clarifications, or updates. Comments appear in chronological order with author and timestamp.
- **Activity Log:** A record of changes (field updates, status transitions, etc.).
- **Linked Items:** Any relationships to other issues (see 1.4 Issue Relationships).
- **Attachments List:** Download or preview attached files.
- **Workflow Actions:** Buttons or controls to transition the issue to the next status (e.g. “Start Progress”, “Resolve”, depending on current state).

Editing an issue’s fields (e.g. changing the description, reassigning, reprioritizing) should be possible directly from the issue view (inline edit or via an edit form). The system shall enforce required fields and data validation on edits. For example, if a workflow rule requires a resolution field on closing an issue, the system should prompt for that. All edits should update the Activity Log for traceability.

**1.3 Issue Workflow:** Each issue follows a workflow (state machine) from creation to completion. By default, a simple workflow will be used (e.g., Open -> In Progress -> In Review -> Done, with the possibility of Reopened). The system shall support customizing workflows per project (administrators can add or remove states and transitions), but the default is designed for common agile development use.

_Figure: Example issue lifecycle with typical states and transitions._ An issue initially starts in **Open** (or “To Do”) state when created. Team members can then move it to **In Progress** when work begins. After development, it might go into **In Review** (e.g. for code review or QA). If the review/QA passes, the issue transitions to **Done** (completed). If problems are found (or a bug isn’t actually fixed), an issue can be **Reopened**, sending it back to In Progress. These transitions can be triggered by users through the UI (e.g. clicking “Start progress” moves Open -> In Progress) or automatically via integrations (e.g. a merged pull request might move an issue to Done). The system shall record who performed a transition and when, in the issue’s history.

The workflow engine must enforce that only valid transitions occur (e.g. you cannot move directly from Open to Done without passing any intermediate states, unless the workflow is configured that way). It should also allow certain transitions only to specific roles (e.g. maybe only QA role can move to Done, etc., as configured in workflow settings). Additionally, the system **shall allow custom workflows** to be defined to suit different teams’ processes, including custom statuses and rules ([Objectives of Bug Tracking System - Functional Requirements | Kissflow](https://kissflow.com/issue-tracking/objectives-of-bug-tracking-system/#:~:text=,Workflows)). For example, a team might add a “Testing” state between In Progress and Done, or have a separate “Code Review” and “QA” states. The application will provide a workflow editor (likely for administrators) and enforce the configured workflows at runtime.

**1.4 Issue Relationships:** It’s often necessary to link issues to each other to capture dependencies or hierarchies:

- The system shall support a parent-child hierarchy (Epic -> Story -> Sub-task). For example, an **Epic** is a large feature that can have many child stories; a story can be broken into technical subtasks. The issue view should show the parent and list of children where applicable (with quick navigation).
- The system shall support generic issue linking with relationship types such as “relates to”, “duplicates”, “blocked by / blocks”. Users should be able to link any two issues and specify the link type. This helps in dependency tracking (e.g. bug X blocks feature Y).
- If an issue is closed as a duplicate of another, the UI should reflect that (and possibly auto-link them as Duplicate type).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can add or remove links between issues. The linked issues should display reciprocal links (if X “blocks” Y, Y should show “is blocked by X”). These relationships do not enforce behavior by default (except possibly in some reports or queries), but give users context. In future, rules could be added (e.g. cannot close an issue if it has open blockers – but that would be a configurable project rule beyond base requirements).

**1.5 Searching and Filtering Issues:** Given potentially thousands of issues, the system shall provide robust search and filter capabilities:

- A **Quick Search** bar for simple keyword searches across issues (matching in title, description, or comments). This should support identifiers (typing an issue key jumps to it).
- An **Advanced Search** or filter builder allowing combination of criteria: by project, status, assignee, label, issue type, priority, etc. This is akin to JQL (Jira Query Language) in Jira – e.g. the user can find “all open bugs assigned to me with priority High”.
- Saved Filters: Users shall be able to save search queries for reuse, and possibly share them with others. For example, a product owner might save a filter for “Open issues tagged as Customer Feedback”.
- Filters should be usable in other contexts, such as on boards or reports (e.g. a board can show issues from a saved filter).
- **Performance:** Searches should return results quickly even with large datasets; indexing may be used to optimize this. (See Non-functional requirements for performance targets.)

**1.6 Sorting and Bulk Operations:** In any list of issues (search results, backlog list, etc.), the user should be able to sort by common fields (e.g. sort by priority, by update date, etc.). They should also be able to select multiple issues and perform bulk operations if they have permission, such as:

- Bulk edit (change a field for many issues at once, e.g. assign 10 issues to a new team member).
- Bulk transition (move a set of issues to a new status, if the workflow and permissions allow).
- Bulk delete (rare, and permission-controlled, typically only admins).
- Bulk move to another project (if needed, to re-categorize issues).

Such bulk operations shall obey the same validation rules per issue as single edits (if any issue in the selection fails a rule, the operation should report which ones failed).

**1.7 Notifications for Issue Events:** (Cross-referenced in the Notifications section, but listed here for completeness) – when important events happen to an issue (creation, assignment, status change, comment added, etc.), the system shall trigger notifications to interested users. By default, the reporter and assignee are notified of updates. Users can also **watch** an issue to get notifications. The types of notifications and channels (email, in-app, etc.) are described in **Notifications** below.

**1.8 Import/Export:** The system shall provide a way to import issues in bulk (e.g. via CSV or Excel, useful when migrating from another tool or uploading a list of requirements). It shall also allow exporting issue lists (to CSV/Excel or PDF) for reporting or backup. Exports should respect access permissions (only issues the user could see in the app should be exported).

**1.9 Issue Copy/Template:** (Nice-to-have) Users should be able to clone an existing issue to create a new one (copying fields) to avoid re-entering details for similar tasks. Also consider support for issue templates (pre-defined sets of fields for certain issue types).

**1.10 Traceability:** To support traceability, every change to an issue (field change, status, etc.) should be recorded. The system should also allow referencing issue IDs in commits, MR descriptions, or other parts of the tool to easily create cross-links. For example, typing an issue key in a commit message will later appear as a link in that issue’s details via integration (see **Integrations** section on Smart Commits).

In summary, the Issue Tracking module provides the fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on issues, with rich metadata and workflow support, ensuring teams can **identify defects easily, measure their scope, determine their impact, and manage all steps involved in resolving them from a centralized interface ([Objectives of Bug Tracking System - Functional Requirements | Kissflow](https://kissflow.com/issue-tracking/objectives-of-bug-tracking-system/#:~:text=The%20basic%20objective%20of%20a,all%20from%20a%20centralized%20interface))**. A well-implemented issue tracker is critical to coordinate the development effort and maintain a single source of truth for the project’s progress.

### 2. Backlog Management (Backlog Grooming)

The Backlog Management module deals with organizing and refining the **product backlog** – the prioritized list of work items that are not yet scheduled into a sprint (for Scrum teams) or not yet in progress (for Kanban/continuous flow teams). Backlog grooming (also known as backlog refinement) is an ongoing process where the team reviews and prioritizes these items to keep the backlog healthy and ready for planning.

**2.1 Product Backlog View:** The system shall provide a dedicated view of the backlog for each project. This typically appears as a list of issues (often user stories, improvements, or bugs) that are in an unscheduled state (e.g., status = Open and not assigned to any active sprint). Key requirements for this view:

- **Ordered List:** The backlog items are orderable. The product owner or authorized user can drag and drop issues in the list to reprioritize them. The order of items represents priority (top = highest priority).
- **Grouping:** It should be possible to group or categorize backlog items for clarity. Common approaches:
  - Group by **Epics**: If the project uses Epics, the backlog view can show Epics as headers with their child stories underneath (with indentation or separate pane).
  - Group by **Categories/Components**: Optionally filter or group by component, label, or other classification for focus.
- **Issue Preview:** Each item in the backlog list should show key fields (e.g., issue key, title, maybe story points estimate, and perhaps a few icons for attributes like priority or attachments). Hovering or expanding an item could show a summary or allow quick editing (e.g., edit estimate or assignee without leaving the backlog page).
- **Infinite Scroll or Pagination:** The backlog could contain hundreds of items; the UI should handle this via pagination or infinite scrolling for performance, without overwhelming the client.

**2.2 Backlog Editing and Grooming Actions:** Within the backlog view, authorized users (typically Product Owners or team leads) should be able to perform grooming actions:

- **Create New Backlog Item:** Add a new issue directly in the backlog (perhaps with a quick add form at the top of the list, defaulting to a Story type in Open status). This provides a quick way to capture ideas or requests.
- **Edit Item Details:** The user can click an item to edit fields like title, estimate, etc., or open the full issue details if needed.
- **Estimate Items:** The backlog view should display the estimation field (e.g. story points) for each item and allow setting or updating it inline. This supports the team in estimating effort during refinement.
- **Prioritize/Reorder:** Drag-and-drop reordering as mentioned. This should update a "rank" or order field in the system so that order is preserved. All team members should see the updated order in real-time.
- **Remove or Archive Items:** It should be possible to remove an item from the backlog if it's no longer relevant. This could mean marking it as "won't do" or deleting it (with confirmation). A safer approach is to have a status like "Removed" or a separate archived backlog list to not lose history.
- **Bulk Organize:** Possibly, allow selecting multiple items to move them as a group (e.g., if several low priority items need to be moved down).

**2.3 Definition of Ready Indicators:** The system should support marking backlog items as "ready" for sprint planning. This could be a field or flag indicating that the item has met certain criteria (clear description, acceptance criteria defined, estimated, etc.). For example, a checkbox "Ready for Sprint" can be set on issues that are fully groomed. This helps in filtering the backlog to see which items are candidates for the next sprint. (This is a practice some teams use; not mandatory but useful feature.)

**2.4 Backlog Filtering:** Provide filter options within the backlog view to help focus:

- Filter by Epic (show items under a specific epic).
- Filter by label or component (e.g., only backend tasks vs frontend tasks).
- Text search within backlog items.
- These filters help product owners and teams slice the backlog for discussion (e.g. view only bugs, or only a certain area).

**2.5 Integration with Sprint Planning:** The backlog view is closely linked to sprint planning (next section). The system shall allow selecting items from the backlog to add to a new sprint or an existing planned sprint. Typically:

- There is an interface element (like a panel or drag target) representing the upcoming sprint; users can drag issues from backlog into that sprint to plan it.
- The total of estimates for selected items might be summed up to help the team see the prospective sprint load (useful to check against team velocity or capacity).
- Once a sprint is started, those items move out of the backlog (since they are now in progress scope). Items not completed in a sprint might return to backlog automatically (addressed in Sprint section).

**2.6 Backlog Grooming Meetings (Use case):** As a scenario, during a backlog grooming session, the team reviews the top N items:

- The system should allow multiple team members to view the backlog concurrently, with real-time updates. If the product owner reorders items or edits a story, all participants should see the changes (perhaps via live updates).
- Team members might discuss an item and decide to split it: the system should support creating new issues (sub-tasks or related stories) and possibly linking them, then the product owner can adjust priority accordingly.
- They might also attach notes or acceptance criteria in the Description to clarify the item. The requirements emphasize that the tool should make this collaboration smooth, reflecting changes immediately and maintaining a single source of truth for the backlog.

In summary, backlog management ensures there is **a well-organized, prioritized list of work** for the team. The application must make it easy to **regularly assess backlog health by identifying and addressing potential issues, using visualization and easy editing tools ([7 Backlog Management Tools [2024] - Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/backlog-management-tools#:~:text=7%20Backlog%20Management%20Tools%20,features%20like%20Kanban%20boards))**. A well-groomed backlog (with high-priority items clearly defined and estimated) is crucial for effective sprint planning, which the next section addresses.

### 3. Sprint Planning and Management

For teams using Scrum (time-boxed iterations), the Sprint Planning module covers creating sprints, selecting work from the backlog, and managing the sprint execution and completion. A “sprint” is a fixed-length iteration (e.g. 2 weeks) with a defined set of issues the team commits to deliver. The system needs to support the full sprint lifecycle: planning -> active sprint tracking -> closure.

**3.1 Creating a Sprint:** The system shall allow users with the appropriate role (e.g. Scrum Master or Project Admin) to create a new sprint in a project. Required information to create a sprint:

- **Sprint Name:** (optional) A custom name or number for the sprint (e.g. “Sprint 5” or “Mobile Launch Sprint”).
- **Start Date and End Date:** Sprints have a start and end date. The system should enforce that end date is after start date. Typically, teams define sprint duration (like 2 weeks) and the tool can assist by defaulting the end date based on a chosen duration.
- **Sprint Goal:** (optional) A short description of the objective of the sprint (e.g. “Finish checkout feature and improve performance on search”).
- Once created, a sprint exists in a **planned state** (not started yet). The project can have at most one active sprint at a time (for Scrum; parallel sprints in one project might be an advanced scenario, but generally one team = one sprint at a time, unless doing multiple teams in one project).

**3.2 Adding Issues to a Sprint:** Users shall be able to populate the sprint with issues from the backlog (as mentioned in Backlog section). This can be done by:

- Dragging issues from the backlog list into the sprint (if using a planning UI).
- Or editing an issue’s Sprint field to assign it to the sprint.
- The system should visually indicate the sum of estimates of issues in the sprint, and perhaps compare it to a known velocity or capacity (if the team has that data configured). For example, if the team’s recent velocity is 30 points and the current selection sums to 50, a warning might be shown that the sprint load is likely too high (nice-to-have).
- If any issue has dependencies (like blocked by another issue not in the sprint), the tool could flag that as well (to warn of risk).

The system must ensure that an issue is not accidentally assigned to multiple overlapping sprints. Typically, the Sprint field on an issue can only hold one sprint (in Scrum context).

**3.3 Sprint Start:** When the team is ready, they **start the sprint**. The system shall provide a command (e.g. “Start Sprint” button) that transitions the sprint from planned to active:

- It should record the actual start time (in case it differs from the scheduled start).
- All issues in the sprint are now considered “in the current sprint” – this often means they show up on the active sprint board.
- Once a sprint is started, its scope is typically fixed. The system may allow adding/removing issues after start (scope change), but if so, it should track such changes (perhaps marking issues added late, etc., for reporting).
- The sprint countdown or timeline should be visible (e.g. “Sprint is 3 days in, 7 days remaining”).

**3.4 Active Sprint Tracking:** During the sprint, team members work on the issues:

- The system’s Agile Board (next section) will show the sprint’s issues in their respective workflow states. Team members will transition issues (Open -> In Progress -> Done, etc.) as work happens.
- The system should continuously update sprint progress data (like how many story points completed vs total, possibly a burndown chart).
- If an issue’s estimate is adjusted mid-sprint or if new work is discovered and added, those changes should reflect in reporting.
- If the team decides to remove an issue from the sprint mid-way (de-scoping), the system should allow it (possibly by moving it back to backlog or to another sprint). Such removal might be captured in a sprint change log for transparency.

**3.5 Sprint Completion:** At or before the end date, the team will **complete (close) the sprint**:

- The system shall provide a “Complete Sprint” action. Upon completion:
  - Any issues in the sprint that are still not in a “Done” state need to be handled. The system should prompt to decide what to do with incomplete issues: typically either move them back to the product backlog (unscheduled state) or move to the next sprint (if one is already created/planned). The user should confirm this handling.
  - The sprint is then marked completed with an end date (actual completion date).
  - The system can generate a **Sprint Report** (see Reporting section) summarizing what was done vs not done.
- After completion, that sprint is archived in a sense (read-only record). It should remain accessible for historical reporting (velocity calculations, etc.).

**3.6 Capacity Management (Optional):** Some teams like to input team capacity (how many hours or points the team has for the sprint). The tool may provide an optional way to enter capacity per person or overall, and then compare planned workload to capacity. This is an enhancement, not strictly required, but if provided:

- Each user could have availability (e.g. Dev A 6h/day, Dev B 8h/day, factoring time off).
- The sprint planning interface might show if a particular person is overbooked based on assigned tasks and remaining hours.
- This can help in distributing work evenly.

**3.7 Parallel Sprints Support:** If the system is used by multiple teams in one project or similar scenarios, it should allow more than one active sprint in the system at the same time **as long as they are in different projects or boards**. In classic Scrum per project, one active sprint per project is the norm. If we want to support multiple teams in one project, the tool should allow defining multiple boards each with its own sprint. However, this can add complexity and might be beyond a basic scope. We note it as a consideration: the architecture should not completely forbid overlapping sprints if needed, but the UI should make it clear which sprint an issue belongs to.

**3.8 Kanban (Continuous) Support:** For teams not using time-boxed sprints (Kanban teams), the concept of sprint is not used. Instead, work is continuous. The system should allow a project to operate in “Kanban mode” where the backlog exists but instead of discrete sprints, issues are pulled into an in-progress state continuously. In such a case:

- The backlog is just the “To Do” column of the board.
- The team limits WIP (Work in Progress) via board constraints (see Agile Board).
- Reports like cumulative flow and cycle time (instead of sprint burndown) apply.
  This mode can be set per project (Scrum vs Kanban template).

### 4. Agile Board Management

The Agile Board is a visual representation of the team’s workflow, showing issues as cards that move across columns (which represent stages like To Do, In Progress, Done). This module encompasses Scrum boards (which correspond to a sprint’s scope) and Kanban boards (continuous flow). The board is key for daily stand-ups and tracking work in real-time.

**4.1 Board View and Columns:** The system shall provide a board view for issues:

- Columns on the board correspond to workflow statuses (or status groups). For example, a simple board could have columns: “To Do”, “In Progress”, “In Review”, “Done”. Each column shows the issues currently in that status.
- It **shall be possible to configure** which statuses map to which column. In simpler terms, the board configuration might allow grouping multiple similar statuses under one column if desired, or splitting (but usually one status per column).
- The order of columns can be customized by the project admin to reflect the actual process flow.
- New statuses added to the project’s workflow (from section 1.3) can be incorporated into the board by adding new columns or updating mapping.

**4.2 Cards (Issue Representation):** Each issue in the sprint or board query appears as a card. The card should display key information at a glance:

- Issue key and title (summary).
- Assignee (often as an avatar image or name).
- Possibly the estimate or remaining time.
- Priority (maybe as a colored flag or icon).
- If the issue has sub-tasks or is an epic with progress, an icon/indicator for that.
- Possibly a quick view of how many comments or attachments (small icons).
- The card should be visually distinct if an issue is nearing a due date or is blocked (e.g. could show a red highlight for overdue, or a blocked icon if it's waiting on another issue).

**4.3 Drag-and-Drop Workflow:** Users shall be able to drag a card from one column to another to update its status (i.e. perform the workflow transition). This should be intuitive and instant, updating the issue’s status in the database and reflecting for all users. If a transition has validations or requires additional input (for instance, moving a card to "Done" might require setting a Resolution field), the system should handle that – perhaps by popping up a dialog for the required input when dropping the card. If the user lacks permission to transition an issue, the drag action should be disallowed (with a visual cue).

**4.4 Real-time Updates:** The board is often displayed on team screens (big visible charts) during stand-ups. The system should update the board in real-time as issues change. If one user moves a card or edits an issue, others viewing the board should see the update without needing a refresh (through WebSocket or similar push technology). This ensures everyone has the latest information and **improves team collaboration and transparency** ([Integrate Jira with GitHub: Streamline Collaboration & Project Management](https://everhour.com/blog/integrate-github-and-jira/#:~:text=)).

**4.5 WIP Limits (Kanban):** For Kanban boards, the system shall support setting Work-In-Progress limits on columns. For example, you might limit "In Progress" to 5 items to ensure focus. If a column has more than the allowed number of cards, the UI should visually highlight this (e.g. column turns red or a warning is shown). This feature helps teams identify bottlenecks and maintain flow.

**4.6 Swimlanes:** The board may support dividing cards into horizontal swimlanes for better organization. Common swimlane configurations:

- By **Assignee**: each row is a person, showing what each is working on.
- By **Sub-task grouping**: parent tasks and their sub-tasks grouped.
- By **Epic**: all issues belonging to an epic grouped.
- By **Issue type**: e.g., separate lanes for Bugs vs Stories.
  Swimlanes are typically configurable in board settings. They help large boards to be more readable by categorizing work.

**4.7 Filters on Board:** Provide quick filters on the board to focus on certain cards. For example:

- Filter by assignee (show only cards assigned to Bob).
- Filter by label or component.
- A text search filter to highlight cards with a matching keyword.
  These filters should be easily toggled during a meeting (e.g. "Let's filter to Alice's tasks").

**4.8 Board Scope:** For Scrum, a board is usually tied to the current sprint of a specific project. For Kanban, the board might show all work in progress in the project (with backlog items either off-board or in a backlog column). The system should allow configuration of the board’s issue source:

- For a Scrum board: the active sprint (and perhaps an option to view future sprint or backlog in a combined mode).
- For a Kanban board: typically a saved filter (e.g. "project = X and status != Done") defines what issues appear.
- The system could allow multiple boards per project with different filters if needed (for example, one board shows only Bugs, another shows Stories – though normally one project one board is enough, multiple boards might be used by different sub-teams).

**4.9 Sprint Board vs Backlog View:** In some tools, backlog and board are two modes of the same screen. Our system can implement them as separate modules but they should integrate. E.g., a Scrum board view often has a toggle to view backlog vs active sprint. It’s acceptable if backlog is separate, but navigation between them should be easy.

**4.10 Board Configuration:** Project administrators shall have a UI to configure their board:

- Choose which issue statuses map to which board columns (and add/remove columns).
- Set WIP limits per column.
- Set the swimlane criteria.
- Set the card layout (which fields or how much detail to show on cards).
- Set quick filters definitions (like define a filter button "Only My Issues").

The configuration changes should take effect immediately for all users of that board.

**4.11 Constraints & Edge Cases:**

- If an issue is in Done column and gets Reopened, it should reappear in the appropriate column (e.g. "To Do") automatically.
- If an issue is removed from the sprint/backlog (scope change), it should disappear from the board (or move to a different board if applicable).
- If an issue is added mid-sprint (scope creep), it should appear on the board in the correct column.
- The board should handle cases where many issues are in one column (some sort of sensible ordering, possibly by priority or rank).
- Card size/overflow: If an issue title is long, the card might truncate it. Possibly allow expanding a card on click to show full details (or open the issue detail view).

In essence, the agile board provides a **visual workflow management tool**. It should enable teams to **visualize progress in real time and drag tasks across workflow columns** easily ([Integrate Jira with GitHub: Streamline Collaboration & Project Management](https://everhour.com/blog/integrate-github-and-jira/#:~:text=Link%20GitHub%20to%20Jira%E2%80%99s%20Scrum,or%20Kanban%20boards%20to)). By making the workflow visible and interactive, it encourages team members to update statuses promptly and helps identify blockers or bottlenecks at a glance.

### 5. User Roles and Permissions

The system will be used by different types of users, and not all users should have the same access or capabilities. This section describes roles and the permission model required to ensure secure and appropriate access control. The goal is to allow **customizable, granular control over who can access what ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=,permissions))**, so that sensitive actions are restricted and the system can be used in large organizations with multiple teams.

**5.1 User Roles:** At a minimum, the system shall support these default roles:

- **System Administrator:** Full access to all projects and system settings. Can manage users, global configurations, and perform any action in any project (override permissions if needed). There may be a distinction between a _System Admin_ (manages application configuration) and _Project Admin_, see below.
- **Project Administrator (Project Lead):** Can manage settings for a specific project. This includes configuring workflows for that project, boards, customizing fields for the project, adding/removing users to the project team, and managing sprints in that project. Project Admins only have admin rights within their project.
- **Developer/Team Member:** A regular user who is part of a project team. Typically can create issues, edit issues, transition them, comment, log work, etc., _within projects they are a member of_. They cannot change project configuration or delete whole projects.
- **QA/Test Engineer:** (This might have similar rights as Developer in terms of issues; separate role optional if needing to distinguish permissions like closing bugs, etc.)
- **Product Owner/Manager:** This role might overlap with Project Admin or be custom – typically can prioritize backlog, but could be simply a team member with perhaps permission to edit priorities on all issues.
- **Stakeholder/Viewer:** A user who might only have read-only access to the project, to view progress and reports, but not modify issues. They may be able to comment if allowed, but not create or transition.
- **Guest/External Reporter:** (If the system is extended to external bug reporting) – an external user who can only create issues (like bug reports) and see their own issues. This is relevant if using the system as a support portal as well, but for now focus on internal use.

The system should allow creating custom roles or adjusting roles per project if needed, but the above cover common cases.

**5.2 Permissions Matrix:** The system shall implement a fine-grained permission scheme. Each action or feature has a permission that can be granted to certain roles or users. Examples of specific permissions:

- **Issue Permissions:**
  - Create Issue, Edit Issue, Delete Issue.
  - Assign Issue (ability to change assignee).
  - Transition Issue (move through workflow).
  - Add Comment, Edit Comment (maybe only own comments editable), Delete Comment.
  - Attach Files.
  - View Issue (even within a project, some issues could be restricted).
- **Project Permissions:**
  - Administer Project (change settings, workflow, boards, versions, components).
  - Manage Sprints (start/close sprints, re-order backlog).
  - View Development Tools integration info (see branch names, commit links) – maybe restrict who can see commit data if needed.
  - Manage Releases (if concept of release versions exists).
- **Time Tracking Permissions:** If time logging is a feature, separate permissions for log work on issues, edit own vs others' logs.
- **Reporting/Dashboard Permissions:** Create shared dashboards or reports might be permissioned.
- **User Management:** Only system admins can create new user accounts or assign roles globally. Project admins might be allowed to add existing users to their project.

Typically, each project can have a _Permission Scheme_ that ties roles/groups to permissions. For simplicity, we can say default mapping:

- System Admin: all permissions.
- Project Admin: all project and issue permissions in their project.
- Developer: all issue create/edit/transition in the project; maybe not delete issues or manage sprints.
- Viewer: only view/comment.

The system shall allow _assigning users to roles per project_. For example, Alice can be a Developer in Project A, but a Project Admin in Project B. This assignment should be manageable by a system or project admin.

**5.3 Authentication & Access Control:** (Though more in Security section) The system shall authenticate users (username/password, or SSO). Once authenticated, the user’s roles in each project determine what they can do in that context. If a user is not part of a project and tries to access it, they should be denied (or perhaps some projects can be public-readable if configured). By default, projects are private to their members.

**5.4 Permission Enforcement:** Throughout the application, UI elements and API actions must check permissions:

- If a user lacks permission, the corresponding button or link should be hidden or disabled (e.g. a read-only user should not see "Edit Issue" button).
- API calls should also enforce, returning authorization errors if an unauthorized action is attempted (to prevent bypass via API).
- Example: Only a Project Admin should see the “Project Settings” menu for that project. Only a user with "Manage Sprints" can start/close sprints.
- When multiple users collaborate, permissions might cause some to have read-only views.

**5.5 Audit and Admin Overrides:** The system admin could have an override ability to view or edit any data if needed (for support). Also, all changes by all users should be logged (with user ID and timestamp) for audit trail; especially admin actions like permission changes or deletions.

**5.6 Role-Based UI Customization:** Optionally, the system could tailor the UI per role (for example, a simplified interface for external reporters with only a “Create issue” and “view own issues” screen). But initially, the same UI can just hide inapplicable functions.

**5.7 IP Allowlisting / Network Restrictions:** In some cases, especially for enterprise, there might be a need to limit access to the application by network location (as an extra security layer). This is a non-functional security feature often. Atlassian’s premium products support _IP allowlisting_ to ensure only trusted networks can access ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=,Premium)). We mention here as an advanced requirement: the system _may_ support IP-based access control at instance or project level for additional security.

**5.8 Example Permissions Scenario:** For clarity, consider a scenario: A _Product Manager_ user wants to re-order the backlog and start a sprint. If they are not a Project Admin, they must have been granted "Manage Sprints" and "Edit Backlog" permissions explicitly (which could be part of a Product Owner role). The system should allow such granularity. Meanwhile, a _Developer_ can move their issues on the board and resolve them, but perhaps cannot change priorities of all backlog items (unless given permission). A _Viewer_ can see the board and issues but cannot drag cards or edit anything. These distinctions ensure control and accountability.

Having a strong roles and permissions system is crucial for **security and data privacy**, and it **gives administrators granular control over who can perform which actions ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=,permissions))**. This is especially important in larger organizations or multi-team setups to prevent unauthorized changes and to protect sensitive information.

### 6. Notification and Collaboration System

Timely notifications keep team members informed of relevant updates without needing to constantly check the application. The Notification system will deliver updates about issues and project events to users through various channels (in-app, email, chat integrations, etc.). Additionally, collaboration features like commenting and @mentions rely on notifications to alert users. This section details how notifications are managed.

**6.1 In-App Notifications:** The application shall have an in-app notification center (often represented by a bell icon).

- When a user is logged in, they receive notifications within the app for events relevant to them: e.g., "Issue ABC-123 has been assigned to you," "Bob mentioned you in a comment on DEF-456," or "Sprint 5 has started."
- Unread notifications should be indicated (e.g. a badge with count). Users can click to view a list of recent notifications. Each notification links to the relevant item (issue or page).
- The system should allow marking notifications as read, and possibly dismissing or deleting them.
- The in-app notifications should update in real-time (using push technology) so that, for example, if someone comments on an issue I'm viewing, I might get an in-app alert immediately.

**6.2 Email Notifications:** By default, users may receive email notifications for certain events:

- The system shall send emails for major events like issue assignment, issue resolved/closed, comments added to an issue the user is watching, etc.
- Each user can configure their email preferences (e.g. some may want emails for everything, others only if they are directly mentioned or assigned).
- Batched emails: The system might combine multiple updates into a single email if they occur in a short window, to reduce spam. For example, if 10 comments are added quickly, send one email summarizing them (this is a nice-to-have optimization).
- Email format: Should be clear and include key info and links back to the application. Possibly include some content of the comment or issue in the email for context.
- The system should avoid emailing users for their own actions (you typically don't need an email that you updated something, except maybe to confirm something like you created an issue, but generally not needed).

**6.3 @Mentions:** In comments or descriptions, the system should support @mentioning a user. E.g., typing @ followed by a username will notify that user.

- When mentioned, the user should get a notification (in-app and/or email) that they were mentioned and by whom, with a link to the comment.
- This improves collaboration by pulling the attention of specific team members to an issue or comment thread.

**6.4 Watching/Subscription:** Users can subscribe to issues or other entities:

- If a user is the Reporter or Assignee of an issue, they are implicitly watching it (should get notifications).
- The system shall allow any user to explicitly "watch" an issue (or an entire project or component). A watcher will receive the same notifications as the reporter/assignee for that issue.
- There should be an indicator of how many are watching an issue (and possibly who, if permissions allow).
- For projects, users might subscribe to all new issues or certain events (this could be a more advanced feature, like subscribe to releases or components of interest).

**6.5 Notification Settings:** Provide a user settings page for notifications where each user can:

- Select which events they want notifications for (e.g. separate toggles for issue created, issue assigned to me, issue resolved, comment added, mention).
- Choose channels: maybe they want only in-app and no emails, or vice versa. Possibly even SMS or push if supported.
- Set up quiet hours or email digest vs immediate (some might want daily digests instead of immediate emails).
- If integrated with chat (Slack, etc.), user can choose to get notifications via that channel instead (see integration).

**6.6 Slack and Chat Notifications:** _(See Integrations for more detail)_. In context of notifications:

- If a project is linked to a Slack channel, certain notifications (like issue created or sprint started) can be sent to that channel for group visibility.
- Users who connected their account to Slack might receive personal notifications as Slack direct messages via a bot, instead of or in addition to email ([Configure the Slack integration | Jira Product Discovery | Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-product-discovery/docs/configure-the-slack-integration/#:~:text=,Jira%20instead%20of%20via%20email)).
- The system should ensure no duplicate overload (if a user gets Slack, maybe they opt out of email).
- Similarly, integration with Microsoft Teams or others could be considered in the future.

**6.7 Webhooks for Notifications:** For extensibility, the system shall allow configuring webhooks: i.e., for certain events, POST a payload to a given URL. This allows integrating with custom systems or performing custom actions. For example, a webhook could notify an external incident management system when a critical bug is filed. The configuration of webhooks might be a project admin feature (like "call this URL on issue created or status changed").

**6.8 Meeting Reminders (Calendar Integration):** Optional nice-to-have: if due dates or sprint end dates are set, the system could send reminders (like "Sprint ends tomorrow, 2 issues remaining"). Or integration with calendar for due dates (publish iCal entries for due dates or sprint timelines).

**6.9 Collaboration Features:**

- **Comments and Discussion:** As mentioned, each issue has comments. Users should be able to format comments (maybe basic Markdown). They should also be able to edit or delete their own comments (with perhaps an admin able to delete any if needed). All of this ties into notifications (people involved or mentioned get alerts).
- **Internal vs External Comments:** If the tool will ever be used with external stakeholders, it might have a concept of internal comments (visible only to team) vs public. Possibly out-of-scope for now, but worth noting as a future requirement if needed.
- **Email Reply to Comment:** A bonus feature: allow users to reply to an email notification and have that become a comment on the issue (via an incoming email handler). This can improve engagement because people can just reply from their email client to comment. This requires processing inbound email and matching issues by keys in subject.

**6.10 Notification Reliability:** The system must ensure notifications are delivered reliably:

- Use background job queues to send emails or messages so as not to slow the main app flow.
- If an email fails to send, there should be retry mechanism.
- Avoid notification storms (if an event triggers many watchers, okay, but ensure the system can handle it).
- Possibly log notifications for audit (at least in debug) to trace if something was sent.

**6.11 Example:** When a developer resolves a bug (changes status to Done and adds a comment "Fixed in commit XYZ"), the system should:

- Transition the issue to Done.
- Add the comment to the thread.
- Immediately notify the reporter (e.g. via email: "Issue ABC-123 was marked Done by DevX, comment: Fixed in commit XYZ"), notify any watchers, and if the team uses Slack integration, post a message in the team’s Slack channel about that resolution.
- If the QA is a specific role, maybe also notify QA lead if needed (that could be configured, but generally watchers cover it).

In summary, the Notifications system ensures all stakeholders stay updated on changes **without needing to constantly check the system**, thus improving responsiveness and collaboration. Modern integrations (like Slack) mean notifications can reach users where they are most active, e.g., "**get personal Jira notifications in Slack via a DM with @Jira instead of via email ([Configure the Slack integration | Jira Product Discovery | Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-product-discovery/docs/configure-the-slack-integration/#:~:text=,Jira%20instead%20of%20via%20email))**". The combination of in-app and external notifications should be flexible to suit different user preferences.

### 7. Reporting and Analytics

This module provides visibility into the project’s progress and the team’s performance through various reports and dashboards. Agile teams rely on metrics and charts (burndown, velocity, etc.) to inspect and adapt their process. The system should offer a range of built-in reports and possibly custom report capabilities.

**7.1 Predefined Agile Reports:** The system shall include standard Scrum and Kanban reports:

- **Sprint Burndown Chart:** For an active sprint, a burndown chart showing remaining work (y-axis, e.g. story points or task count) versus time (x-axis, days of sprint). This helps the team see if they are on track. It should update daily (or in real-time if we track remaining effort). The final point at sprint end should ideally hit zero if all work is done, or above zero if not completed.
- **Sprint Burnup Chart (Scope Change Chart):** Optionally, a burnup chart that shows completed work and total scope lines, to visualize scope changes during the sprint.
- **Velocity Chart:** A bar chart showing how many story points (or items) were completed in each past sprint. This requires historical sprint data. It allows teams to gauge their velocity (average points per sprint) and thus plan future sprints.
- **Sprint Report:** Upon completing a sprint, generate a summary: which issues were completed, which were not (and what happened to them), the sprint goal and whether achieved, and any relevant stats (e.g., original commitment vs completed).
- **Epic Report:** For a given epic (large feature spanning sprints), a report of progress (how many stories done vs total in the epic, possibly a burn-down for the epic across sprints).
- **Release or Version Report:** If the project uses fix versions (release tags on issues), show status of a release: how many issues in that version are done/remaining, and perhaps a projected completion based on current rate. This helps release planning.
- **Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD):** Particularly useful for Kanban, a CFD shows the count of issues in each status over time ([View and understand the cumulative flow diagram | Jira Cloud](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/view-and-understand-the-cumulative-flow-diagram/#:~:text=Cloud%20support,use%20it%20in%20Jira%20Cloud)). It’s an area chart stacking the different states. This helps understand flow, showing if work in certain states is piling up (bands getting wider) or if overall WIP is stable. (E.g., how many items are in To Do, In Progress, Done each day.)
- **Control Chart:** A scatterplot of cycle times (how long issues took to complete) for issues completed in a timeframe. This helps teams understand their cycle time and variability, key in Kanban for process improvement.

**7.2 Custom Reports and Dashboards:** The system shall allow users to create custom reports or dashboards:

- A **dashboard** may be a customizable page where users can add multiple “widgets” or charts, possibly from the above reports or from custom queries. For instance, a manager might have a dashboard with a pie chart of issues by status, a list of top 5 open bugs, and the team’s velocity chart.
- Predefined widgets could include:
  - Pie or bar chart of issues by status, priority, or assignee (distribution at a point in time).
  - Time series of issues created vs resolved over time (to see backlog growth or reduction).
  - List of issues (from a filter) showing key fields – effectively a saved filter gadget.
  - Numeric KPIs: e.g., count of open issues, count of overdue issues, etc.
- Users (or at least project admins) should be able to create dashboards and share them with others or make them project-wide. There could also be personal dashboards (each user can have their own home dashboard customized to what they care about).

**7.3 Data Export for Reporting:** In addition to built-in reports, allow exporting data for external analysis:

- As mentioned in Issue Tracking, ability to export issues to CSV/Excel based on filters (so users can make pivot tables or charts outside if desired).
- Possibly provide a JSON API to query issues or metrics (for feeding into external BI tools).
- If the tool is self-hosted, maybe direct database access could be possible but assume API is safer.

**7.4 Historical Data and Trends:** The system should retain historical information needed for reporting:

- When an issue changes status, that event’s date is recorded (to compute cycle times, etc.).
- Sprint start/end and membership snapshots (so that reports like velocity or sprint report remain accurate even if issue fields change later).
- The cumulative flow can be drawn if the system keeps daily counts or can derive from issue histories.
- Nothing should be lost permanently from a completed sprint or release—archival is fine but still reportable.

**7.5 User Workload Reports:** Provide a way to see each team member’s workload:

- For example, a simple table or chart showing how many issues (or points) each user has in progress, completed, etc., perhaps within a sprint or release.
- This can help identify if someone is overloaded or if work is unbalanced. It should be used carefully (not to micromanage, but to help reassign if needed).

**7.6 Notifications & Subscriptions for Reports:** Perhaps allow scheduling some reports to be emailed to stakeholders periodically. E.g., an email every Monday with the current backlog status, or an email at sprint completion with the sprint report.

**7.7 Metrics for Process Improvement:**

- _Lead Time_ and _Cycle Time:_ The tool should be able to calculate these for issues (lead time = from creation to done, cycle = from work started to done). These can be shown as averages somewhere, or in control charts.
- _Throughput:_ How many issues done per week or month. Could be part of dashboard.
- _Predictability:_ Maybe show how often sprints meet their commitment (issues completed vs committed).

**7.8 Permissions on Reporting:** Respect permissions – e.g., if a user only has access to certain issues, the reports should only use those issues. A user who is not in Project X should not see Project X’s data in cross-project reports.

**7.9 Cross-Project Reporting:** Initially, reports can focus per project. If multiple projects exist (like components or teams), cross-project reports might be useful (like overall progress of multiple teams). If feasible, allow selecting multiple projects in a filter or report criteria. This could be a stretch goal; core focus is within a single project.

**7.10 Example Use:** A Scrum Master at the end of the sprint will open the Sprint Report to run the retrospective. They’ll use the **Sprint Burndown Chart** to discuss how the sprint progressed daily, perhaps noting a scope increase mid-sprint. They’ll check the **Velocity Chart** to see the trend over the last 3 sprints (e.g., 25 -> 30 -> 28 points). For the next planning, that velocity helps decide the load. A Project Manager might use a **Release Report** to see if the upcoming deadline (release) will likely be met, based on how many stories are done vs remaining. A Kanban team lead might review the **Cumulative Flow Diagram** weekly to ensure there’s no growing queue in code review. These built-in tools should be readily available and easy to interpret.

In summary, Reporting and Analytics turns the raw data of issues and sprints into **actionable insights and visibility**. It helps answer questions like “Are we on track?”, “Where are bottlenecks?”, “How did we perform last sprint?”, enabling continuous improvement. The application should provide these in a convenient and sharable form, reducing the need for external reporting tools for everyday management needs.

### 8. Integrations

To be effective in modern software development, the project management application must integrate smoothly with other tools in the development ecosystem. This section describes required integrations with source code repositories, communication tools, and CI/CD pipelines. These integrations aim to **streamline the workflow by linking development activities with project tracking**, thus providing traceability and automation.

#### 8.1 Source Control Integration (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

**8.1.1 Link Commits and Pull Requests to Issues:** The system shall integrate with Git-based source code management platforms (GitHub is explicitly targeted, but the design should allow GitLab, Bitbucket, or others):

- Users should be able to connect a repository (or multiple repos) to the project management system. This might involve authentication (OAuth tokens or app installation on GitHub, for example).
- Once connected, the system shall display development information in the context of issues:
  - For a given issue (say ABC-123), show related branches, commits, and pull/merge requests that reference that issue. Typically this is done by recognizing the issue key in commit messages or branch names.
  - Example: A branch named "feature/ABC-123-add-login" could be auto-linked to issue ABC-123. A commit message containing "ABC-123 Fixed the null pointer bug" should appear in ABC-123’s issue activity.
  - Pull Requests: If a PR title or description has the issue key, or the branch name has it, the PR is linked. The issue view might show "PR #45 opened by Alice - status: open/merged".
- **Smart Commits:** Support parsing special commands in commit messages to trigger issue updates ([Integrate Jira with GitHub: Streamline Collaboration & Project Management](https://everhour.com/blog/integrate-github-and-jira/#:~:text=Developers%20can%20include%20Jira%20issue,commands%20in%20commit%20messages%20to)). For instance, developers including "FIX ABC-123 #done #comment Fixed the bug" in a commit:
  - The system should add that commit’s message as a comment on issue ABC-123 (or at least link the commit and possibly add a comment "Fixed in commit abcdef").
  - If "#time 2h" was in the message, log 2 hours to the issue’s work log (if time tracking is supported).
  - If "#done" or "#close" is in the message, transition the issue to Done (if workflow allows).
  - These commands automate updates and reduce context switching for developers.
- Provide documentation or hints about this syntax to users.

**8.1.2 View Code from Issue Tracker:** As a convenience, when commits or PRs are linked, the system could show a snippet or at least a link. E.g., clicking on a commit in the issue opens it on GitHub for full diff. But within our app, maybe just show commit message and author, date.

**8.1.3 Development Panel:** In the issue UI, have a “Development” section that consolidates all dev links:

- X commits linked, Y branches, Z Pull Requests, etc.
- Possibly build status (if CI is integrated) related to this issue.

**8.1.4 Branch Management from Issue:** Possibly allow creating a new Git branch from the issue tracker UI. For example, a developer on issue ABC-123 clicks "Create Branch" and the system (via integration) creates a branch in the repo named something like "ABC-123-short-name" and provides the git command or if using a cloud IDE, open it. (This could use Git platform APIs.)

**8.1.5 Multiple Repos:** The integration should allow linking multiple repositories to one project if needed (monorepo or multiple component repos). The development panel would aggregate all.

**8.1.6 Permissions & Security:** Only show dev info to users who should see it. Possibly require the user to have access to the repo too (though in a small team, if they have access to project, likely they have code access).

**8.1.7 Benefits:** This integration gives **enhanced traceability** – one can trace from an issue to the code changes that addressed it, and vice versa. It also **improves collaboration and reduces manual linking**, since linking code and issues is automatic with keys ([Integrate Jira with GitHub: Streamline Collaboration & Project Management](https://everhour.com/blog/integrate-github-and-jira/#:~:text=combination%20is%20the%20GitHub%20and,issue%20tracking%20and%20agile%20development)) ([Integrate Jira with GitHub: Streamline Collaboration & Project Management](https://everhour.com/blog/integrate-github-and-jira/#:~:text=Conclusion)).

#### 8.2 Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Integration

**8.2.1 CI Pipeline Status in Issues:** The system shall integrate with CI/CD tools (could be Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.). Whenever code is committed or a PR is opened/merged for an issue, builds might run:

- The issue view should show the latest build status related to that issue. For instance: "Build #123 (CI pipeline 'Regression Tests') – **PASSED** at 2025-04-28 14:32".
- If a build fails for a commit that references an issue, the issue might show a warning or notification: e.g. "Build failed for commit abcdef in branch feature/ABC-123". Optionally, it could reopen the issue or create a subtask for fixing the build (this is more automation).
- In a release context, if deploying code for an issue, you might tag an issue as “Deployed to Staging” or similar; the integration could update a field or comment when a deployment of that issue occurs.

**8.2.2 Triggering CI from Tool:** Possibly allow certain actions to trigger CI:

- Example: A Release Manager might press "Deploy release 1.2" in the tool which sends a webhook to CI to trigger a deployment pipeline. This is more a release feature, but integration can allow sending commands out.

**8.2.3 Linking CI Jobs:** Provide a configuration where you can link Jenkins (or others) job URLs to the project. Then, the system can, via webhooks or polling, get build results.

- If a build is associated with specific issue keys (via commit or branch name), update those issues.
- Alternatively, the integration could be simpler: at the project level, just show overall build status if needed.

**8.2.4 Deployment Tracking:** If CI/CD pushes to environments, integration might mark issues as "In Production" once their commits are deployed. Jira, for example, has a Release Hub that shows which issues are in which environment (via info from CI/CD). Our requirement could be simplified: at least indicate if an issue’s fix has been deployed (if that info is available from CI/CD, likely through tagging releases).

**8.2.5 Artifact Linking:** If relevant, link to build artifacts or logs from the issue.

In summary, CI/CD integration ensures that the state of the code (build passing or failing, deployed or not) is visible in the project management tool, closing the loop between code changes and issue tracking. It helps teams get feedback: for example, if a test fails for a story, they know right away and can fix it.

#### 8.3 Communication Tool Integration (Slack, etc.)

**8.3.1 Slack Integration:** The system shall integrate with Slack to enable notifications and interactions from Slack:

- **Notifications to Slack:** Users or admins can configure certain events to be posted to Slack channels. For example, when a high-priority bug is created, post a message in `#bugs` channel. When a sprint starts or ends, post in team channel. This can often be configured via rules (maybe a default is to post all issue updates to one channel, but ideally filterable).
- **Personal DM Notifications:** As referenced earlier, the app can send personal notifications via a Slack bot (like “Jira bot”). A user connects their account to Slack; then instead of email, they get a DM from the bot for things like "assigned to you" or mentions ([Configure the Slack integration | Jira Product Discovery | Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-product-discovery/docs/configure-the-slack-integration/#:~:text=,Jira%20instead%20of%20via%20email)).
- **Issue Previews:** If someone types an issue key or paste an issue link in Slack, the integration should unfurl it – meaning the Slack bot will reply with a short summary (Issue title, status, assignee, maybe priority) ([Configure the Slack integration | Jira Product Discovery | Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-product-discovery/docs/configure-the-slack-integration/#:~:text=via%20a%20DM%20with%20%40Jira,a%20channel%20of%20your%20choosing)). This way, team members get context without switching to the browser.
- **Create Issues from Slack:** The integration shall allow creating an issue via Slack command. For instance, typing `/jira create` (assuming "/jira" is the command) should prompt for issue details or use a Slack dialog to input summary, description, etc., then create the issue in the system ([Configure the Slack integration | Jira Product Discovery | Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-product-discovery/docs/configure-the-slack-integration/#:~:text=%2A%20Issue%20previews%20,is%20sent%20in%20a%20conversation)). This is helpful for quickly logging issues during discussions.
- **Operate on Issues from Slack:** Stretch goal: allow basic operations through Slack, such as transitioning an issue or adding a comment. E.g., a Slack message from the bot about an issue could have action buttons like "Comment" or "Mark Done". The Atlassian official Slack integration supports transitioning, assigning, commenting from Slack ([Configure the Slack integration | Jira Product Discovery | Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-product-discovery/docs/configure-the-slack-integration/#:~:text=,the%20context%20of%20a%20conversation)). Our system should aim for similar capabilities to improve efficiency.
- **Slack to Issue linking:** If a conversation in Slack is relevant, one might want to send it to the issue comments. Possibly an action "send this Slack thread to issue" could create a comment with the transcript link. This might be advanced, not core.

**8.3.2 Microsoft Teams Integration:** Similar considerations for Teams (or others like Google Chat). At least, the system's architecture should allow plugging in other chat integrations in the future. For now, Slack is the primary example.

**8.3.3 Email (as a fallback integration):** Email is universal – our tool should allow interacting via email to some extent:

- Creating issues via email: e.g., send an email to a specific address and it becomes an issue (helpdesk style). This might be more relevant if the system is used for bug reporting by external users. It’s an optional integration to consider.
- Responding via email to comment (as mentioned in Notifications, to integrate email with comments).

#### 8.4 Other Integrations and APIs

**8.4.1 Knowledge Base / Documentation (e.g. Confluence):** Many software teams link user stories or requirements to documentation pages. While not requested explicitly, an integration with a documentation tool (like Confluence) could be valuable:

- At minimum, allow linking out to docs or storing wiki-style pages in the project.
- Possibly a direct integration: e.g., show a list of Confluence pages related to an epic or allow creating an issue from a requirements page.

**8.4.2 External Issue Trackers:** Sometimes teams use multiple tools (though ideally not). If needed, integration to sync issues with another tracker (like if part of team uses GitHub Issues or Asana, etc.). Tools like Exalate or others do this. Not in core scope, but leaving room for extensions is wise.

**8.4.3 REST API for Integration:** The system shall provide a comprehensive REST (or GraphQL) API for all its core features. This allows custom integrations beyond those we build in. The API should be secure (with tokens/OAuth) and allow operations like creating issues, retrieving issues, updating statuses, etc. Many companies script custom flows or integrate with internal tools using such an API.

- Also consider **webhooks** (as mentioned in notifications) as part of integration offering.

**8.4.4 Plugin/Extension Framework:** While not immediate, to mirror Jira's strength with plugins, consider designing the system to be extensible. A plugin architecture or at least well-defined extension points (like adding custom fields types via plugins, or custom event listeners) could be a requirement for scalability in use-cases. However, this is more of an architectural requirement (non-functional perhaps).

**8.4.5 Calendar Integration:** Integration with calendar applications (Outlook, Google Calendar) for things like due dates, sprint dates, could be considered. E.g., an iCal feed of sprint milestones.

**8.4.6 DevOps Toolchain Example:** Envision a typical use case: A developer is working on issue _ABC-123_. They create a branch in GitHub named "abc-123-fix-login-bug". The system immediately picks up that branch and links it to ABC-123 (via webhook from GitHub or polling). The developer commits and pushes with message "ABC-123 #done fixed null check". The CI pipeline runs tests on that commit. The commit message triggers (via integration) the issue ABC-123 to transition to Done and add a comment "Fixed null check". The test pipeline fails, and via integration, the issue ABC-123 gets reopened automatically (since we can configure that failing CI for an issue reopens it, an advanced but possible rule) – or at least a notification is posted to the issue that CI failed. The developer sees the failure, fixes code, pushes again. This time tests pass and CI posts back that build passed. Meanwhile, every event was also being sent to a Slack channel: the team saw that ABC-123 was marked done then reopened then done again, with links to build logs. Finally, when deploying to production, the release pipeline might mark a bunch of issues including ABC-123 as "Released" or post a summary in Slack that these issues are now live. This seamless flow shows the power of integrating all pieces: it **removes manual steps and shortens delivery time by automation** ([Jira Software + GitHub · GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/jira-software-github#:~:text=Jira%20Software%20%2B%20GitHub%20%C2%B7,steps%20and%20shorten%20delivery%20time)) ([Integrate Jira with GitHub: Streamline Collaboration & Project Management](https://everhour.com/blog/integrate-github-and-jira/#:~:text=By%20integrating%20GitHub%20with%20Jira%2C,the%20advantages%20for%20software%20teams)).

**8.4.7 Integration Configuration:** The system should provide a UI for admins to configure integrations:

- For GitHub: e.g., enter credentials or install app, choose which repos to connect.
- For Slack: authenticate the Slack bot/app and choose channels or default notifications.
- For Jenkins/CI: provide endpoints or tokens to connect, specify which job corresponds to which project (or allow auto detection via branch naming).
- These settings might be at project level (likely, since each project might have different repo or channel) or global if one instance of Slack for all.

**8.4.8 Security and Permissions in Integrations:** Ensure that integration does not expose information in unsecured ways. For instance, if a private project posts to a public Slack channel, that’s misconfiguration – but the system might warn if doing such. Also, API tokens for integrations need to be stored securely (encrypted).

Overall, the integrations module is about making the project management system a hub in the development lifecycle, not an isolated tool. By enabling linking with code and communication, it achieves the benefit described earlier: _“teams benefit from real-time issue tracking, automated time logging, better collaboration, and smoother development workflows”_ ([Integrate Jira with GitHub: Streamline Collaboration & Project Management](https://everhour.com/blog/integrate-github-and-jira/#:~:text=By%20integrating%20GitHub%20with%20Jira%2C,to%20set%20up%20this%20integration)). This will increase team efficiency and data consistency across tools.

---

The above sections covered all primary functional requirements for the system. Next, we detail the non-functional requirements which define the expected qualities and constraints of the system.

## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify criteria that judge the operation of the system, rather than specific behaviors. These include usability, performance, scalability, security, maintainability, and other quality attributes. They are just as crucial as the functional requirements to ensure the system meets user expectations and organizational standards.

### 9. Usability and User Experience

The application will be used daily by software teams, so it must be **user-friendly, intuitive, and efficient to use**. Good usability reduces training time and errors, and enhances user satisfaction.

**9.1 Ease of Use:** The system’s UI should follow common design principles and be intuitive for users familiar with web applications and agile tools. New users should be able to perform basic tasks (like creating issues, updating status) without extensive training. Field labels and options should be clear and use industry-standard terminology (e.g. “Backlog”, “Sprint”, “Issue Type”, etc.). The overall layout should logically organize information (e.g., issue details page separating description, metadata, comments, etc. in a clean way).

**9.2 Consistency:** The user interface should be consistent in design and behavior across modules. For example, filtering an issue list should work similarly in backlog view, search results, and on boards. Buttons and icons should have consistent meanings (e.g. a pencil icon always means edit). Consistent color coding (maybe green for done, yellow for in progress, red for high priority, etc.) helps quick recognition.

**9.3 Accessibility:** The application shall comply with accessibility standards so that it can be used by people with disabilities. Specifically, aim for **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance at minimum. Atlassian (Jira) for example abides by WCAG guidelines to make content accessible ([Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG - Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/compliance/resources/wcag#:~:text=Web%20Content%20Accessibility%20Guidelines%20,to%20people%20living%20with%20disabilities)). This implies:

- All functions should be accessible via keyboard (for those who cannot use a mouse). e.g., using Tab/Shift+Tab to navigate and Enter/Space to activate buttons.
- Provide text alternatives for non-text elements (icons should have screen-reader labels, charts should have descriptions).
- Ensure sufficient color contrast in the UI.
- Support screen readers (proper HTML semantics, ARIA labels where needed).
- Avoid elements that could trigger seizures (no flashing).
- The VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) for the product should indicate support for WCAG criteria.

**9.4 Keyboard Shortcuts:** To improve efficiency for power users, provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions ([Use keyboard shortcuts | Jira Cloud - Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/use-keyboard-shortcuts/#:~:text=Use%20keyboard%20shortcuts%20,fingers%20off%20of%20the%20keyboard)):

- E.g., press "c" to create a new issue (Jira uses “c” for create).
- Press "g + i" to go to issues search (just an example, as Jira does).
- Arrow keys to move between cards on a board when a card is selected.
- Shortcut to open the quick search, navigate through search results, etc.
- A help menu listing all shortcuts should be accessible (maybe via "?" key).
  Having shortcuts aligns with known patterns (Jira, Trello have similar). This allows frequent users (developers often prefer keyboard) to navigate quickly **without taking fingers off the keyboard ([Use keyboard shortcuts | Jira Cloud - Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/use-keyboard-shortcuts/#:~:text=Keyboard%20shortcuts%20are%20a%20good,fingers%20off%20of%20the%20keyboard))**.

**9.5 Responsiveness (UI adaptability):** The UI should be responsive to different screen sizes. While most usage might be on desktop web, some users might open it on a tablet or phone browser. The layout should adjust (e.g., collapse side menus on small width, allow vertical scrolling of boards, etc.). If a dedicated mobile app is not in scope, ensure at least basic tasks are possible on mobile web (like viewing an issue, commenting, maybe moving a card). In time, a mobile app could be considered, but initially responsive design is the goal.

**9.6 Performance Perception:** UI design affects perceived performance:

- Use loading spinners or skeleton screens when data is loading so user knows something is happening.
- Paginate or virtualize long lists to avoid freezing the browser with too much DOM (e.g., backlog with 1000 items should not render all at once).
- Provide quick feedback on actions: if user transitions an issue on a board, the card should move immediately (optimistically, with server confirmation behind the scenes).
- Avoid unnecessary page reloads – use AJAX and dynamic updating for smooth experience.

**9.7 Error Handling & Help:** If the user encounters an error (e.g., failed to save issue due to network), show a clear message with guidance (and not a cryptic code). Provide tooltips or help text for complex fields (like a tooltip explaining “Story Points” field if hovered). Possibly integrate context-sensitive help or link to documentation/FAQ for usage questions. If a user tries to do something not allowed (due to permissions or workflow), the message should explain why.

**9.8 Customizability of UI:** Some degree of customization improves usability for different users:

- Allow users to configure their dashboard with widgets as mentioned.
- Remember user’s last used filters or view settings.
- Possibly let users choose light/dark theme (many devs prefer dark mode).
- Reorder columns in a table or choose which columns to display in list views.
- Language localization: ideally the UI should support multiple languages (English default, but design text externalization to allow adding translations). This broadens usability for non-English speaking teams.

**9.9 Onboarding & Guidance:** For new projects or new users, having a brief onboarding tutorial or sample data can help. E.g., upon first login, show a quick tour of main features (point out "This is your backlog, you can create issues here..."). For a new empty project, have a step-by-step to create first issue, first sprint, etc., or a link to docs.

**9.10 Collaboration Facilitation:** Because this is for teams, the UI should reflect multi-user collaboration:

- If two people are editing the same description, consider a locking or at least an alert "User X is editing...".
- If a board is open on a screen for a stand-up, as mentioned real-time updates are needed so one person moving a card is seen by all.
- Possibly show presence (like "3 people viewing this issue now" or a user icon on cards if someone is currently viewing or editing it).
- These aren't strict requirements but nice touches that modern collaborative software sometimes includes.

**9.11 Feedback Mechanism:** Provide an easy way for users to give feedback (maybe a “Feedback” button or link to support) so that continuous improvement of UX is possible.

To sum up, the application should be **easy to learn and efficient to use**, with attention to accessibility. It should cater to both casual users (who need simplicity) and power users (who demand shortcuts and advanced filtering). Adhering to WCAG and UI consistency ensures it is usable by a wider audience and meets corporate accessibility mandates. Atlassian’s own focus on making Jira accessible and adding keyboard shortcuts sets a benchmark our tool should strive for ([Accessibility improvements in Jira | Jira Software Data Center 10.5](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver/accessibility-improvements-in-jira-993923419.html#:~:text=10,0%20AA)) ([Keyboard Shortcuts you should be using - The Jira Guy](https://thejiraguy.com/2021/04/07/keyboard-shortcuts-you-should-be-using/#:~:text=Keyboard%20Shortcuts%20you%20should%20be,typing%20and%20using%20the%20mouse)).

### 10. Performance and Scalability

The system must perform well with immediate responsiveness in common scenarios, and be able to scale to handle large numbers of users, projects, and issues as usage grows. Performance requirements define the speed of operations, and scalability defines how the system maintains performance as load increases.

**10.1 Response Times:** Common user actions should execute quickly:

- Viewing an issue details page: < 2 seconds to load on average, for an issue with moderate data (e.g., 10 comments). Even with many comments or links, aim for < 3 seconds for 95th percentile.
- Transitioning an issue or adding a comment: should be effectively instant from the user perspective (< 1 second to update UI after submission). The server update can happen asynchronously but should complete within ~1-2 seconds and update any relevant UI (like the board).
- Opening the backlog page: < 3 seconds to initially load the top of the backlog. The backlog might lazy-load additional items as user scrolls.
- Loading the Agile board: < 2 seconds for initial load for a typical sprint (say 50 issues). If hundreds of issues on a board, maybe up to 4-5 seconds but we should encourage breaking into smaller sprints or use pagination for Kanban if needed.
- Running a search query: simple filters should return in < 2 sec. Complex queries (many conditions or regex) maybe a bit longer, but aim to keep even 90th percentile search under 5 sec.
- Generating a report (like burndown): < 2 sec for recent data. Possibly some heavy reports (like velocity over dozens of sprints) could precompute or cache so it’s quick.

**10.2 Concurrency and Load:** The system should support multiple concurrent users without degradation:

- Target at least **500 concurrent active users** (users performing actions at the same time) initially, with the ability to scale to thousands. (Active means doing something within a short window; many more might be logged in idle).
- Under typical load (like 100 active users), all response times as above should hold.
- Under peak load (say 500 active performing heavy actions like searches), the system should still respond reasonably (maybe degrade some to 95th percentile 5-8 sec for heavy ops but not worse).
- Avoid any architecture that single-threads operations per project or locks globally, to maintain concurrency. Use asynchronous processing for heavy tasks (like sending notifications or generating very heavy reports).

**10.3 Data Volume Scalability:** The system should handle large volumes of data as follows:

- **Issues:** Support at least up to 1,000,000 issues in a single instance (if not more). It’s known that Jira can handle millions of issues per instance without performance issues given proper infrastructure ([Jira Cloud performance with over 1M issues - Atlassian Community](https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Jira-questions/Jira-Cloud-performance-with-over-1M-issues/qaq-p/1260450#:~:text=Community%20community,without%20any%20performance%20gaps)). Our system should architect for similar scale. Even if one project likely won't have a million, across projects it can accumulate.
- **Projects:** Support hundreds or even thousands of projects in an instance. There may be separate teams each with their project. (Atlassian Cloud supports up to 50k users and presumably thousands of projects).
- **Users:** Support a large user base. For Cloud deployments, Jira has a limit around 50,000 users per instance on standard/premium ([Compare Atlassian Cloud vs Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/compare-cloud-data-center#:~:text=Compare%20Atlassian%20Cloud%20vs%20Data,30%2C000)). We should aim to meet or exceed that. The architecture (especially if self-hosted or data center deployments) should allow scaling to **50k+ users** (with clustering if needed). Atlassian Data Center even goes beyond with no fixed cap (just dependent on infrastructure) ([Compare Atlassian Cloud vs Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/compare-cloud-data-center#:~:text=Compare%20Atlassian%20Cloud%20vs%20Data,30%2C000)).
- **Attachments:** Potentially gigabytes of file attachments. Should be stored efficiently (maybe on cloud storage or dedicated file store) and served via CDN if possible for performance. Ensure the database doesn't choke on attachment BLOBs by storing them externally.
- **Custom Fields and Workflow Complexity:** As usage scales, projects may add many custom fields or complex workflows. The system should handle, say, up to 100 custom fields per project without major perf hit (this is something Jira struggles with if too many global custom fields). We should consider indexing and lazy loading of seldom used fields to mitigate performance issues in large configurations.

**10.4 Scalability Strategies:** The system shall be designed to scale both **vertically** (more CPU, memory on server) and **horizontally** (multiple server nodes):

- Use stateless web/application servers so they can be load-balanced. The database or a shared cache may be the bottleneck; plan for read-replicas or sharding if needed at high scale.
- Possibly partition data by project if needed to distribute load (though that's complex, maybe as future improvement).
- Use caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., metadata like project settings, user profile info, etc., to reduce DB hits).
- The system should allow enabling a CDN for serving static assets and perhaps heavy API GETs (with caching headers).
- We should ensure that adding more app servers can linearly increase throughput to support more concurrent users.

**10.5 High Availability:** (This ties to reliability too, but from performance view) - the system should avoid single points of failure. Clustering with failover nodes so if one server goes down, others handle traffic, ensures consistent performance and uptime.

**10.6 Background Processing:** Use background jobs for things that can be asynchronous:

- Sending notifications emails/messages.
- Re-indexing search after bulk changes.
- Generating large reports or exports (maybe generate then let user download when ready).
- This prevents those tasks from blocking user threads and keeps UI snappy.

**10.7 Performance Testing:** As a requirement, the system shall be tested under load with expected peak usage to verify it meets these targets. We should create benchmark scenarios (1000 issues, 100 users doing operations X, etc.) and measure. Adjust as needed.

**10.8 Network Performance:** Optimize data payloads:

- Use efficient data formats (JSON compressed) for API responses.
- On pages like backlog or board, only load necessary data (e.g., don't load full issue details for all, just summary and needed fields).
- Use pagination or lazy load to avoid sending thousands of records at once.
- Use webhooks rather than polling for integrations where possible to reduce load.

**10.9 Client-Side Performance:** The front-end should also handle lots of DOM elements or data gracefully:

- Virtual scrolling for long lists (render only visible items).
- Debounce frequent events (like typing in a filter box triggers search after pause, not every key stroke).
- Memory leaks avoided so it can stay open all day in a browser tab.

**10.10 Scalability Limits and Warnings:** If there are any hard limits (like perhaps if using some technology that has a cap), document them. Ideally the system imposes as few limits as possible, but for practicality maybe:

- If a single project having >100k issues is a problem, maybe recommend splitting projects or archiving old ones.
- Or implement archiving of old issues to keep active working set smaller (as a maintenance task).
- The system might have to warn if too many issues are put in a sprint or if a query is too broad (like a query that returns 100k results might need a warning to refine search rather than try to display everything).

To illustrate scale: Atlassian's Jira Data Center is known to handle **10 million issues** in testing ([[Interview] Can JIRA Software Data Center Handle 10 Million Issues? - Valiantys - Atlassian Platinum Partner](https://valiantys.com/en/blog/agility/interview-can-jira-software-data-center-handle-10-million-issues/#:~:text=,ons%2C%20etc)). They note performance depends on number of users, amount of data, and complexity of configuration ([[Interview] Can JIRA Software Data Center Handle 10 Million Issues? - Valiantys - Atlassian Platinum Partner](https://valiantys.com/en/blog/agility/interview-can-jira-software-data-center-handle-10-million-issues/#:~:text=,ons%2C%20etc)). Our target of 1 million+ issues and thousands of users is in line with needing enterprise scalability. The system should be designed such that performance is a function of hardware and can be maintained by scaling resources, not fundamentally limited by software design.

In summary, the application should deliver **fast response times for an interactive user experience**, and **scale to a large user base and data set** without significant performance deterioration. Proper architectural choices (efficient algorithms, indexing, caching, concurrency) must be in place to meet these demands.

### 11. Security and Data Protection

Security requirements ensure that the application protects sensitive data and is resilient against attacks. Since this system will contain potentially confidential project information and personally identifiable information (user accounts), it must adhere to high security standards.

**11.1 Authentication:**

- The system shall support secure authentication mechanisms. At minimum, username and password with hashed (and salted) password storage.
- **Password Policy:** Configurable rules like minimum length, complexity, expiration, etc., to meet organization standards.
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):** Ideally support MFA (either built-in TOTP or integration with SSO that provides MFA).
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Integration with SAML 2.0 or OAuth2/OIDC providers (like Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace) so enterprise users can login with corporate credentials. Atlassian supports SAML SSO in their premium offerings ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=,SCIM%20Atlassian%20Guard)); our system should too to be enterprise-friendly.
- **Session Security:** Use secure cookies, with HttpOnly and Secure flags. Possibly allow IP or geo restrictions on sessions (if suspicious login, alert or block).
- Idle session timeout configurable (e.g. logout after 1 hour of inactivity, unless “remember me” is used with a refresh token).

**11.2 Authorization:** As detailed in Roles & Permissions, enforce that users only access projects and issues they are permitted to. This includes:

- API endpoints checking permissions on each request.
- UI elements hidden if no access, but still server-side checks must exist (don't rely purely on hidden UI).
- If a user tries to guess an issue ID from another project, they should get a not found or access denied.
- Ensure no data leaks via search or reports (the search backend should filter by user permissions, etc.).

**11.3 Data Encryption:** All data in transit and at rest should be encrypted to protect confidentiality:

- **In Transit:** Use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all client-server communications. Also for server-to-server integration calls. The system must enforce TLS so that user credentials and session info are not exposed. As Atlassian notes, _all data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+ with Perfect Forward Secrecy_ ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=,256)).
- **At Rest:** Sensitive data stored on the server (databases, backups) should be encrypted. If using cloud infrastructure, use encrypted storage volumes. In particular, customer data (issues, attachments) should be on encrypted disks. If multi-tenant (for cloud offering), ensure strong isolation. Atlassian uses **AES-256 encryption at rest** on servers ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=,256)); we should do similarly.
- If storing secrets (like integration tokens, passwords), they must be encrypted in DB as well (or at least hashed if one-way, or encrypted if we need to retrieve them).
- **Backups** also encrypted.

**11.4 Secure Development (OWASP Top 10):** The application shall be developed with security best practices to avoid common vulnerabilities:

- Prevent **SQL Injection** (use parameterized queries / ORM).
- Prevent **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: escape or sanitize all user-generated content before displaying. Comments and descriptions might contain special characters, ensure they don’t break out of context. If allowing rich text or HTML, use a safe subset or a library to sanitize.
- **CSRF Protection:** Use anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing requests, or same-site cookies. Ensure that requests that modify data cannot be forged from another site.
- **Access Control**: already covered, but ensure no broken access control issues.
- **Audit Logging:** Important actions (login, failed logins, permission changes, project create/delete) should be logged. This helps detect malicious activity.
- **Validation:** Validate all inputs on server side. Length limits on text fields to prevent extremely large inputs, proper formats for fields (like email, dates).
- **File Upload Security:** Virus scan or restrict executable file attachments if needed. At least store with safe file names (no path traversal, etc.), and don't allow HTML attachments to be served as pages (to avoid stored XSS via attachment).
- **Dependency Security:** Use up-to-date libraries and scan for known vulnerabilities (maybe incorporate security scanning in CI).

**11.5 Privacy and Compliance:**

- If personal data is stored (even just names/emails of users), comply with regulations like GDPR. This may mean:
  - Ability to delete or anonymize a user’s personal data upon request (right to be forgotten).
  - Clearly state what data is collected and how it’s used (likely in a privacy policy).
  - If in EU, possibly need ability to specify data storage region, etc., but that's beyond basic spec.
- Follow a **Data Processing Addendum (DPA)** if needed for customers, similar to Atlassian’s approach ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=Data%20Processing%20Addendum)).
- The system should at least allow an admin to deactivate or delete a user, and possibly remove identifying details if needed.

**11.6 Security Features for Enterprise:**

- **IP Allowlisting:** As mentioned, ability to restrict access to the application to certain IP ranges (especially for on-prem or private cloud deployments) ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=,Premium)).
- **SCIM for User Provisioning:** If SSO is used, also supporting SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) to automatically provision/deprovision users from a directory would be beneficial ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=,SCIM%20Atlassian%20Guard)).
- **Device Security:** Possibly detect if a device is not secure? That might be out of scope for our app, more handled by SSO.

**11.7 Third-Party Integrations Security:**

- Ensure that tokens/credentials for integration (GitHub, Slack, etc.) are stored securely. Possibly encrypt them and never log them.
- The integration should respect scopes (only request minimum necessary permissions on external systems).
- If a third-party webhook is set up, validate it (e.g., Slack signing secret, GitHub signature) to ensure the call is from genuine source.

**11.8 Performance & Security:** There is a trade-off but ensure security checks don't degrade performance significantly. Use caching for permissions if needed, but carefully.

**11.9 Disaster Recovery and Data Integrity:**

- Regular backups of data (with secure storage).
- Possibly real-time replication to a standby server.
- In case of a crash or data corruption, procedures to restore with minimal data loss (point-in-time recovery).
- Also, ensure data integrity on transactions (use proper ACID compliance in DB, etc., so that partial failures don't corrupt system state).

**11.10 Compliance Standards:** If marketing to enterprise, plan for compliance certifications:

- SOC 2 Type II (Security, Availability, Confidentiality trust principles likely).
- ISO 27001 for InfoSec management.
- Perhaps FedRAMP if government (which would entail encryption, auditing, etc., at strict levels).
- PCI DSS not directly relevant unless storing credit card info (not typical for this app).
- But in case integrate with billing (marketplace), maybe.
  Atlassian lists compliance like SOC2, SOC3, ISO 27001/27018, PCI DSS, GDPR, etc ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=Image%3A%20SOC%20logo)) ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=ISO%2FIEC%2027001)) – we should at least aim for the common ones like SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR compliance readiness.

**11.11 Security Testing:**

- The system shall undergo regular security testing: static code analysis, dependency vuln scans, and penetration testing by a third party or internal security team.
- A bug bounty or responsible disclosure program is a good practice (Atlassian uses Bugcrowd ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=Atlassian%20Bug%20Bounty%20report))).
- All high-severity issues found must be fixed before production use.

**11.12 Example Security Scenario:** If a user attempts SQL injection by typing `' OR 1=1` in a search box, the system should treat it as a search string (perhaps escaping it) and not let it affect queries. If an attacker tries a CSRF by tricking an admin to click a link to delete a project, the CSRF token missing or incorrect will prevent it. If someone tries to access an issue URL that they shouldn’t, they get an error page with no information leak. In transit, someone sniffing network traffic should only see gibberish due to TLS. If the database is somehow accessed, data should be encrypted (at least attachments or sensitive fields) to prevent easy reading.

The overarching principle is **defense in depth**: multiple layers of security so that if one is bypassed, others still protect the system. By following industry best practices and possibly leveraging frameworks' security features, the application can achieve a high level of security. Customers should feel confident their data is safe: _“All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+ ... and at rest with AES-256 encryption ([ Jira Security | Atlassian ](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/security#:~:text=,256))”;_ the permission system ensures only authorized access, and the platform is regularly audited for vulnerabilities. Security must be considered from day one to avoid costly issues later.

### 12. Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability

Beyond performance and security, the system should be reliable and maintainable:

- **Reliability:** The system should function correctly and be resilient to errors.
- **Availability/Uptime:** Target a high uptime (e.g., 99.9% or higher for a production environment). This may involve redundancy and careful deployment strategies.
- **Maintainability:** The system should be designed for easy maintenance and upgrades, with clean code structure and documentation.

**12.1 Uptime and Redundancy:**

- Aim for **99.9% uptime** (which is about < 1.5 minutes downtime per day, or < 9 hours per year) for critical production use. Higher levels (99.99%) may require more elaborate infrastructure (multiple data centers, etc.).
- Avoid single points of failure: e.g., have redundant application servers, a cluster for the database or at least a failover instance.
- Use health checks and monitoring. The system should have monitoring hooks for things like error rates, response times, resource usage, so ops teams can detect issues early.
- In case a component fails (one app node crashes), the load balancer routes to others and the system remains available (with maybe a slight performance dip).
- Zero-downtime deployments: design deployment process (blue-green or rolling updates) so that new versions can be deployed without taking the system offline.

**12.2 Data Backup & Recovery:**

- There shall be daily backups of the database at minimum, and frequent incremental backups (or continuous WAL shipping) if possible, to ensure ability to recover to a recent point.
- Test restore procedures regularly.
- For cloud offering, consider multi-AZ or multi-region replication for disaster recovery.

**12.3 Consistency and Error Handling:**

- The system must keep data consistent. Use transactions for multi-step updates so either all or none apply (e.g., creating an issue might touch multiple tables—ensure atomicity).
- If an operation fails mid-way (e.g., network glitch during a bulk update), the system should either roll back or have a way to recover partial state gracefully.
- Implement graceful error handling: if a microservice or external integration is down, the system should degrade functionality but not crash entirely. E.g., if Slack API is down, the app still works but maybe queues notifications for later or just logs errors.

**12.4 Maintainability (Code and Config):**

- The codebase should be modular (each module like issues, boards, etc., separated), following clear patterns, to ease future changes.
- There should be adequate documentation for developers (internal) and configuration docs for administrators (external).
- Configurations (like port numbers, DB credentials, integration keys) should be in config files or environment, not hardcoded, to allow changes without code changes.
- Logging: The system should have extensive logging at appropriate levels (info, warning, error, debug). This aids in troubleshooting issues. Sensitive info should not be logged (to maintain security).
- Provide administrative tools for maintenance: e.g., re-index data if search index corrupt, clear caches, etc.

**12.5 Upgrades and Compatibility:**

- If versioning, ensure data migrations are handled on upgrade. Write upgrade scripts or backward compatible changes so that upgrades do not break the system or require huge downtime.
- Try to maintain API compatibility for integrators when possible (versioned APIs).
- Document changes in new releases for users and admins.

**12.6 Scalability of Maintenance:**

- As number of projects/users grows, admin interfaces should still be manageable. For example, if there are 1000 users, the user management UI should provide search and not try to list all in one page.
- Similarly for projects or custom fields lists.

**12.7 Localization and Timezone Support:**

- If global teams use it, support multiple timezones (store times in UTC internally, display in user’s locale). Also, date formats, number formats, etc., should adapt to locale.
- Language packs for different languages should be loadable if needed (maintainability for internationalization).

**12.8 Environmental Requirements:**

- The application should be deployable on common platforms (e.g., a Linux server environment, possibly containerized via Docker). This ensures maintainers can run it in their infrastructure. Provide environment configuration guidelines.
- If using cloud-managed, then ensure it runs on the chosen stack reliably (e.g., on AWS, works with their RDS, etc.)

**12.9 Example Scenario:** Consider a scenario where the database server crashes unexpectedly. The system should have a failover (replica gets promoted) ideally, and application reconnects with minimal disruption. Users might experience a brief hiccup but not data loss (thanks to replication). Meanwhile, alerts go out to admins. If a new version of the tool is being deployed, a rolling update ensures some instances serve traffic while others restart, so users maybe just see slight slowness but no downtime. If an admin mistakenly deletes a project, the system should have a safeguard (confirmation, maybe a soft-delete) and backups allow restoration if needed.

While not explicitly requested in the prompt, reliability and maintainability are implied in any robust product for software teams. Many of these aspects would be expected by such teams and by enterprise customers, so it’s prudent to include them in a comprehensive spec.

---

The above non-functional requirements ensure that the system, beyond having rich features, will be dependable, secure, and a pleasure to use. They set the quality bar for implementation.

## Use Case Scenarios

To contextualize the requirements, this section presents a few **use case scenarios** that illustrate how various parts of the system work together in real-world usage. These scenarios act as examples to validate that the functional requirements are sufficient to support typical workflows of a software team.

### Use Case 1: Bug Report and Resolution Workflow

**Goal:** A QA engineer finds a bug, reports it, and the development team fixes it through to completion, using the issue tracking, workflow, and notification features.

- **Actor:** QA Engineer (Reporter), Developer (Assignee), Project Manager.
- **Preconditions:** The project exists, team members are set up with appropriate roles. The system is integrated with version control and CI.

**Basic Flow:**

1. **Bug Reporting:** The QA Engineer navigates to the project and creates a new issue of type "Bug". They fill in the summary ("Login page throws error on submit"), detailed steps to reproduce in description, set Priority = High, and attaches a screenshot of the error. They leave it Unassigned for triage.
2. **Notification of New Issue:** The system creates issue BUG-101 and notifies the Project Manager (who is watching all new bugs) via email or Slack that a new High priority bug was reported.
3. **Triage and Assignment:** The Project Manager reviews the bug in the backlog view. They decide this must be fixed in the current sprint, so they assign it to a Developer and drag it into the current Sprint (or if mid-sprint, they add it as scope change). The issue status remains "Open" (to-do).
4. **Developer Starts Work:** The Developer gets a notification (in-app and Slack DM) that they were assigned BUG-101. They read the details, then click "Start Progress" on the issue. The issue status moves from Open -> In Progress, which automatically makes it appear in the "In Progress" column on the team’s board. The QA Engineer (reporter) also gets notified that the issue is being worked on.
5. **Development and Commit:** The Developer writes code to fix the bug. In the commit message, they include "BUG-101 #done Fixed null pointer exception on login" (using Smart Commit syntax). They push the code to GitHub. The integration picks up the commit:
   - The commit is linked to issue BUG-101 (appears in the issue’s development panel).
   - The "#done" command triggers the system to automatically transition BUG-101 to "In Review" (or directly to Done if configured so).
   - A comment is added to BUG-101 with the commit details (and the message "Fixed null pointer...").
6. **Code Review & CI:** A Pull Request is opened for the fix, and the CI pipeline runs tests. The Pull Request is linked to BUG-101 as well. Suppose the CI tests pass and the code is merged. The issue is now ready for verification.
7. **QA Verification:** The QA Engineer sees that BUG-101 is marked as In Review (maybe the workflow is such that after dev done, QA needs to test). They deploy the latest build or get it from CI, verify the bug is fixed. They then transition the issue to "Done". (If it wasn’t fixed, they’d transition to Reopened with a comment, and the Developer would get notified and repeat some steps).
8. **Completion:** BUG-101 now in Done, is visible in the Done column of the board. Everyone watching the issue gets a notification it was resolved. It will appear in the Sprint Report as completed. The QA Engineer is satisfied.
9. **Postcondition:** The bug is fixed, issue closed. The commit that fixed it and test results are traceable via the issue links. If anyone views BUG-101 later, they see it was fixed, by whom, in which commit, and when.

This scenario demonstrates issue creation, assignment, workflow transitions, integration (commit link and auto-transition), and notifications. It shows the value of integration: the developer didn’t have to manually update the issue status; the commit message did it, saving time and ensuring real-time updates ([Integrate Jira with GitHub: Streamline Collaboration & Project Management](https://everhour.com/blog/integrate-github-and-jira/#:~:text=Developers%20can%20include%20Jira%20issue,commands%20in%20commit%20messages%20to)). The QA was kept in the loop via notifications, and the PM could track it on the board and sprint report.

### Use Case 2: Sprint Planning and Execution

**Goal:** The team plans a new sprint from the backlog and then executes it, using backlog, sprint, board, and report features.

- **Actors:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- **Precondition:** The product backlog is populated with prioritized stories, some estimated. The team has historical velocity data.

**Planning Flow:**

1. **Backlog Refinement:** Before sprint planning meeting, the Product Owner uses the Backlog view. They drag the highest priority items to the top, ensure each has clear description and acceptance criteria, and mark a few as "Ready for Sprint". They also confirm estimates are set (using Planning Poker or any method offline, then entering story points in the tool).
2. **Sprint Creation:** In the tool, the Scrum Master clicks "Create Sprint". They name it "Sprint 10", set duration 2 weeks (dates auto-filled), and note a Sprint Goal "Finalize user profile feature".
3. **Selecting Work:** During the planning meeting, the Product Owner and team select stories from top of backlog to include in Sprint 10. They drag 5 user stories (totaling say 25 points) into the Sprint. The tool shows a running sum of 25 story points selected. The team's velocity from last 3 sprints was ~20-25, so this seems reasonable.
4. **Capacity Check:** One team member will be on vacation, effectively reducing capacity by 5 points. The Scrum Master checks that with 25 points they might be slightly over capacity. They decide to remove one small 3-point story, bringing total to 22 points. Now it's comfortable.
5. **Sprint Start:** They click "Start Sprint". The Sprint moves to Active state. All selected issues now are tagged as "Sprint 10" and appear on the Scrum Board in the "To Do" column. Team members get notified of sprint start and can see which items are in the sprint (some tools email the sprint commitment to the team).
6. **Daily Execution:** Each day, developers pick items:
   - They move a story from To Do to In Progress on the board when they start it. They use the board view during daily stand-ups to discuss progress.
   - One story, when being implemented, is found more complex, so the dev breaks it into sub-tasks in the tool (creates 2 sub-task issues linked under it). They move those through In Progress -> Done. When all sub-tasks done, the parent story auto-transitions (or the dev transitions it) to Done.
   - Mid-sprint, a critical bug (BUG-202) comes in. The team decides to pull it into the sprint. The Scrum Master adds BUG-202 to Sprint 10 via backlog drag-and-drop. The scope change is recorded. This appears on the board in To Do.
   - The team perhaps exceeds WIP limits at one point (3 items In Progress when WIP limit is 2). The board column highlights the issue; they realize and pause starting new work until one is finished.
7. **Monitoring Sprint Progress:** The Product Owner and Scrum Master frequently check the **Burndown Chart**. It shows that by day 3, only 2 points burned down, and scope increased by 5 points due to the bug, so the line is above ideal. They communicate with team to ensure they catch up. By day 10, ideally, the burndown reaches zero.
   - The Scrum Master also checks the **Sprint Report** mid-sprint to see what's done.
   - If some tasks look delayed, they might decide to drop a low-priority story to backlog (de-scope). They remove one story from the sprint (scope reduction), which is recorded.
8. **Sprint Completion:** At the end of 2 weeks, they complete Sprint 10:
   - The Scrum Master clicks "Complete Sprint". There are 1 story and 1 bug still In Progress not finished. The tool prompts to move them. They choose to push them back to backlog for now.
   - Sprint 10 is marked done on date. The Sprint Report is generated automatically.
   - The team holds a retrospective, looking at the Sprint Report: It shows 5 issues committed, 4 completed, 1 not completed (with reason). They discuss why that one slipped. The Velocity chart updates showing 19 points completed (so velocity ~19 this sprint).
9. **Postcondition:** Sprint 10 artifacts (report, charts) are saved. The backlog now has the unfinished work at top for next sprint planning. The team achieved most goals and moves on.

This scenario showed backlog usage, sprint creation, adjusting scope, using the board daily, and reports for feedback. It demonstrates how the tool supports the Scrum ceremonies (planning, daily scrum via board, review via completion, and retrospective via report). It also shows how scope changes are handled (both addition and removal) and how the team benefits from visibility (burndown chart and board gave immediate feedback on progress and issues).

### Use Case 3: Developer Collaboration and Integration in Workflow

**Goal:** Demonstrate how integrations (GitHub and Slack) assist in the workflow for a developer working on a feature, and how the system fosters collaboration.

- **Actors:** Developer, Team (via Slack).
- **Precondition:** Project is integrated with GitHub and Slack. Developer is a member of a Slack channel where project notifications go.

**Flow:**

1. **Starting a Feature:** A Developer picks a user story "Implement profile picture upload" from the sprint backlog. They go to the issue (USER-50). From the issue page, they click an option "Create branch". The integration prompts repository selection (if multiple), branch name suggestion "user-50-profile-pic". The developer confirms and a new branch is created in GitHub. The issue now shows that branch under its development panel.
2. **Code and Commit:** The developer writes code and makes commits. They mention the issue in commit messages, e.g., "USER-50 add image upload backend". Each commit triggers a Slack notification in the channel ("DevX pushed 3 commits to branch user-50-profile-pic (issue USER-50)") – this assumes we set such notifications. The team sees progress.
3. **Pull Request & Discussion:** Developer opens a Pull Request for the feature. The integration posts in Slack: "PR #12 opened for USER-50 by DevX: Add profile upload feature". Team members in Slack can click to view PR or the issue. Some discussion happens on GitHub PR.
   - Meanwhile, in the issue tracker, USER-50 now shows a linked PR. The status of PR (open) and any build status if available are shown.
4. **Continuous Integration:** The CI pipeline runs tests on the PR. The result (say it passes) is shown on the PR and also reflected in the issue (issue might show "Latest build: Passed"). If it failed, it could post a Slack alert "Build failed for PR #12 (USER-50)" which pings the developer.
5. **Peer Review:** Another developer reviews and approves the PR on GitHub. The PR is merged. The integration perhaps triggers the issue to transition to Done (if configured, or developer does it manually). A Slack message "PR #12 merged for USER-50" appears. The issue tracking system might auto-comment "Pull Request #12 merged by Reviewer".
6. **Feature Flag to Deployment:** Suppose deployment is automatic to a staging environment. The CI after merge deploys to staging and runs integration tests. If an issue is linked, once deployed, maybe a comment or field updates "Deployed to Staging at build 5".
7. **Slack Issue Operations:** Later, a question comes up about this feature from QA. QA pings the developer in Slack, referencing the issue key USER-50. Slack bot automatically unfurls the issue with title "Implement profile picture upload - Status: Done - Assignee: DevX - 0 open sub-tasks". QA uses a Slack command `/jira comment USER-50 "Found an edge case where file size > 5MB fails"` (for example). This adds a comment to the issue without QA leaving Slack ([Configure the Slack integration | Jira Product Discovery | Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-product-discovery/docs/configure-the-slack-integration/#:~:text=%2A%20Issue%20previews%20,is%20sent%20in%20a%20conversation)). The developer gets notified (also in Slack) of the comment mention. They realize it's a new bug, and directly from Slack they use `/jira create` to create a Bug linked to that story.
8. **Postcondition:** The Developer was able to do version control operations integrated with issues (branch creation, automatic linking via commit/PR), and the team stayed informed via Slack notifications. They even used Slack to interact with the tracker (adding comment, creating a new issue). This saved time and kept context switching low, as **they could interact with Jira from Slack and see issue previews in conversations ([Configure the Slack integration | Jira Product Discovery | Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-product-discovery/docs/configure-the-slack-integration/#:~:text=,Jira%20instead%20of%20via%20email))**. Collaboration was enhanced by everyone seeing updates in the channel.

This scenario highlights integration and collaboration:

- Code integration (branches, commits, PRs linking to issues, Smart Commits usage).
- Chat integration (Slack notifications, issue previews, and commands).
- It shows the tool's ability to keep everyone in sync across different systems. No one had to manually copy paste updates between GitHub, Jira, Slack; it flowed automatically, fulfilling the promise of a unified DevOps experience.

### Use Case 4: Metrics and Management

**Goal:** A Team Lead or Manager reviews project analytics to make decisions using the reporting features.

- **Actor:** Project Manager (or Scrum Master).
- **Precondition:** Several sprints have been completed, and data is available. The project also has a mix of story and bug data that can be reported on.

**Flow:**

1. **Velocity Check:** The Project Manager opens the Velocity Chart on the Reports screen to see the last 6 sprints. It shows an upward trend from 20 to 30 points per sprint. They use this information to set realistic scope for upcoming sprints and to report to stakeholders that the team's throughput is improving.
2. **Cumulative Flow for Kanban Team:** In another project that is Kanban (no sprints), the manager opens the Cumulative Flow Diagram. They notice that the "In Review" band is widening over the past 2 weeks, indicating a bottleneck in code review. They decide to allocate more reviewer time or change process to address this. They also see the overall WIP is creeping up, so they might enforce WIP limits more strictly.
3. **Release Progress:** A release "v2.0" is planned in 1 month. Using the Release Report (or a saved JQL filter "fixVersion = v2.0 AND status != Done"), they see that 75% of issues targeted for v2.0 are completed, 25% remain open. They specifically note which high priority items are still open and bring those up in the next planning meeting to ensure they're addressed. The report also shows no critical bugs open for the release, which is good.
4. **Team Workload:** The manager goes to a Dashboard they've set up. On it:
   - A pie chart shows issues by assignee for the current sprint, confirming work is evenly distributed.
   - A bar chart shows open issues by priority, noticing 5 "High" priority issues still open; they ensure those are being actively handled.
   - A custom chart shows "Created vs Resolved issues per week" over the last 8 weeks, which generally balances except one week where created spiked (perhaps due to a large testing phase).
   - This helps identify if the team is being swamped by new issues or keeping up.
5. **Reporting to Stakeholders:** The manager exports a Sprint Report as PDF to share with a client, or perhaps uses Confluence integration (if exists) to automatically include a live report on a status page. The ability to pull these without manual screenshotting is valuable.
6. **Adjusting Process:** Based on the control chart showing some outliers (a few tasks took 20+ days in what is usually 5-day cycle), the manager investigates those issues. They might find those were blocked by external factors. This insight leads to a process change: mark such issues with a "Blocked" status in future to separate them out visually.

This scenario emphasizes how the system’s analytics features are used in decision-making and continuous improvement. The manager can quickly glean insights:

- Bottlenecks visible in CFD or WIP trends.
- Team capacity vs demand visible in created vs resolved or backlog growth charts.
- Delivery predictability via velocity.
- All of which help them take actions to keep the project on track.

By providing these use cases, we validate that the functional requirements we specified indeed support realistic workflows:

- Use Case 1 touched on issue tracking, workflow, notifications, integration and demonstrated their interplay.
- Use Case 2 covered backlog, sprint, board, and reports.
- Use Case 3 highlighted integrations (GitHub, Slack) and collaboration.
- Use Case 4 used reporting and analytics.

Each requirement we enumerated can trace to one or more steps in these scenarios (a form of requirements validation and also hinting at a traceability matrix from use cases to requirements).

## Data Flow Diagram and System Architecture

To further clarify how information moves through the system, we include some diagrams. These diagrams illustrate the interactions between components and the flow of data in typical operations.

_Figure: System Context Diagram –_ This diagram shows the high-level architecture and integration points of the project management application. The core **Project Management Application** interacts with:

- **Users (Developers, QA, PM, etc.)** who use the web UI (or API) to perform actions like creating issues, updating boards, planning sprints. Users may also interact via external interfaces like email or chat (Slack) which go through integrations.
- **Database** where all persistent data (issues, comments, users, etc.) is stored. The application reads from and writes to the database on each operation.
- **GitHub** (or other Git servers) via an API integration. The application can fetch commit and PR info from GitHub and also register webhooks to receive events (like new commit) from GitHub. This two-way arrow indicates both pulling data (like showing branches in an issue) and reacting to events (like a commit triggering an issue update).
- **Slack** (or other chat) via its API to send notifications (outgoing) and via bot commands (incoming from user in Slack). For example, when an issue is updated, the app calls Slack API to post a message; when a user issues `/jira create` in Slack, Slack calls the app (webhook) to create issue ([Configure the Slack integration | Jira Product Discovery | Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-product-discovery/docs/configure-the-slack-integration/#:~:text=,Jira%20instead%20of%20via%20email)).
- **CI/CD Pipeline** (like Jenkins) via webhooks or API: the app may send a trigger (e.g., telling Jenkins to run a job) and Jenkins calls back the app when a build completes (with status). This integration ensures build results are reflected in the app.
- The dashed lines in the figure indicate event-driven updates (webhooks), whereas solid lines indicate direct usage or API calls.

This context diagram underscores that our system is not isolated; it’s part of a toolchain and data flows in from code repos and out to communication tools, providing a seamless experience.

_Figure: Issue Workflow State Diagram –_ This diagram depicts the possible states and transitions for a typical issue in the system. It aligns with the description in section 1.3:

- States: **Open** -> **In Progress** -> **In Review** -> **Done**, with a possibility to go to **Reopened** if needed.
- Transitions (labeled on arrows):
  - "Start progress" from Open to In Progress.
  - "Dev completes" from In Progress to In Review (perhaps when a developer finishes coding).
  - In Review can go to Done ("Approved/QA passed") if testing/review is successful.
  - Or In Review can go back to In Progress ("Changes requested") if issues are found.
  - Done can go to Reopened ("Bug found") if an issue that was considered done is found to be insufficient.
  - Reopened goes to In Progress to be fixed.
- This diagram helps visualize the lifecycle an issue can cycle through. It's a relatively simple default workflow; in practice it could be customized, but the core idea of moving left-to-right toward Done, with potential backflows, is captured.

**Data Flow Considerations:** In a data flow diagram (DFD) context, we can consider how data moves:

- A user submitting a new issue -> the application processes it (maybe running validation, setting defaults) -> writes to the database -> then triggers a notification process (which takes user data and issue data, formats a message, sends via email/Slack).
- When a developer commits code referencing an issue -> GitHub sends a webhook payload -> our app receives it (with commit info and issue key) -> updates the issue status in DB -> and maybe sends out notifications or triggers a CI update.
- When a user loads a dashboard -> the app queries the database for various aggregated data -> perhaps does some on-the-fly calculations (or fetches from a cache) -> sends the compiled data to the UI in form of charts.

**Tables and Data Model:** While not explicitly requested, it's useful to think of key data entities:

- _Project:_ fields (id, name, key, description, lead, settings like workflow scheme, permission scheme).
- _User:_ (id, name, email, roles, etc).
- _Issue:_ (id, project_id, key, type, status, summary, description, priority, assignee, reporter, created date, updated date, resolution, etc).
- _Comment:_ (id, issue_id, author, body, created date, etc).
- _Attachment:_ (id, issue_id, file_path or storage ref, filename, uploader).
- _Sprint:_ (id, name, start date, end date, complete flag, goal, project_id).
- _IssueSprint (link table):_ Many-to-many if an issue can be in multiple (though usually not; but maybe keep history? Or simpler: add sprint_id field in Issue for current sprint).
- _Board/Column config:_ for customizing board columns.
- _Link:_ (id, issue_id, linked_issue_id, link_type).
- _Worklog:_ if time tracking, store work entries.
- _Notification subscription:_ (user_id, project_id or issue_id or type, channel preference).
- _Integration tokens/config:_ (project_id, integration_type, auth info).
- etc.

One table example could be **Roles and Permissions** mapping:
But describing all would be too detailed. Instead, we might illustrate a sample table of roles:

**Table: Default Roles and Allowed Actions**

| Role                    | Description                                                                                  | Key Permissions (examples)                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| System Administrator    | Super-user for the entire system. Can manage global configurations, users, and all projects. | - Manage users (create/delete)<br>- Configure global settings<br>- View and edit all projects and issues (override permissions)                                                                               |
| Project Administrator   | Administers a specific project. Typically the team lead or scrum master.                     | - Edit project settings (workflows, components)<br>- Add/remove users to project roles<br>- Manage sprints and releases in that project<br>- Full issue permissions in project (create/edit/delete any issue) |
| Developer (Team Member) | Regular project contributor (developer, QA, etc.) with rights to handle issues.              | - Create issues<br>- Edit issues (fields) and own comments<br>- Transition issues in workflow<br>- Attach files, log work<br>- Cannot delete issues or modify project settings                                |
| Viewer/Reporter         | Stakeholder or external reporter with limited access.                                        | - Create issues (if external reporting is allowed, else just view)<br>- View issues<br>- Add comments (maybe only on issues they reported)<br>- Cannot transition or edit core fields on issues not their own |

_(Note: The actual permission model is more granular; this table is an overview of typical role capabilities.)_

This table reinforces understanding of how roles differ and is derived from the requirements in section 5.

**Performance Benchmarks Table (Examples):**

We can also tabulate some scalability targets for clarity:

| Aspect                 | Target Requirement                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Max Issues per Project | 100,000 (system-tested up to 1 million across projects)                                          |
| Max Concurrent Users   | 500 active (with ability to scale beyond to thousands)                                           |
| Max Projects in System | 1,000+ projects                                                                                  |
| Issue Page Load Time   | < 2s (for 95% of loads) when cached / small history, < 5s for very large issues                  |
| Bulk Update Operation  | e.g. 100 issues edited in one action should complete in < 10s                                    |
| Notifications Latency  | Events trigger notifications within 1 minute (most within seconds)                               |
| Uptime                 | 99.9% or higher (max ~8h downtime/year)                                                          |
| Support Browser        | Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge; degrade gracefully on older or IE if required. |

These numbers summarize some earlier points and set concrete expectations for testing.

## Conclusion

This requirements document outlined a comprehensive set of features and quality criteria for a Jira-like project management tool geared towards software teams. We covered functional modules (issue tracking, backlog, sprints, boards, roles, reports, integrations) and non-functional needs (usability, performance, scalability, security, etc.), accompanied by use cases and diagrams to illustrate the intended usage and system behavior.

By adhering to these requirements, the development team should create a system that allows software organizations to **plan efficiently, collaborate in real-time, integrate development activities, and gain insights** into their process. The emphasis on integration with tools like GitHub and Slack ensures the app fits into modern development workflows, enabling benefits such as **real-time tracking and automated updates** ([Integrate Jira with GitHub: Streamline Collaboration & Project Management](https://everhour.com/blog/integrate-github-and-jira/#:~:text=By%20integrating%20GitHub%20with%20Jira%2C,to%20set%20up%20this%20integration)). Security and scalability considerations mean the system will be suitable for enterprise deployment, protecting data and maintaining performance even as usage grows ([[Interview] Can JIRA Software Data Center Handle 10 Million Issues? - Valiantys - Atlassian Platinum Partner](https://valiantys.com/en/blog/agility/interview-can-jira-software-data-center-handle-10-million-issues/#:~:text=,ons%2C%20etc)).
