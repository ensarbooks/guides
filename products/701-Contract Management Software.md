# Contract Management Software Requirements Document (Draft)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Contract Management Software (CMS) solution. The primary purpose is to support internal review and vendor selection processes for a solution suitable for Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) operating primarily in the United States (US) and India.

The goal is to identify a CMS that streamlines the entire contract lifecycle, enhances efficiency, improves compliance, reduces risk, and provides valuable insights through modern features, particularly focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, robust integrations, and comprehensive reporting.

## 2. General Requirements

- **Target User:** The solution must be suitable for SMBs, considering potential budget constraints and the need for ease of implementation and use.
- **Ease of Use:** The user interface (UI) should be intuitive and user-friendly, requiring minimal training for users across different departments (e.g., legal, sales, procurement).
- **Security:** The platform must provide robust security features, including data encryption (at rest and in transit), access controls, user permissions, and compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, relevant Indian regulations).
- **Scalability:** The solution should be scalable to accommodate future business growth in terms of user numbers, contract volume, and feature requirements.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The CMS should be a reliable cloud-based solution with high availability and adequate backup/disaster recovery mechanisms.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Core Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM)

- **Centralized Repository:** Secure, searchable central storage for all contracts and related documents.
- **Contract Creation/Authoring:** Ability to create contracts from templates or custom drafting. Support for clause libraries and standardized language.
- **Workflow Automation:** Configurable workflows for contract review, approval, and execution processes. Automated routing and notifications.
- **Negotiation & Collaboration:** Tools to support internal and external collaboration and negotiation, including version control and track changes.
- **Execution:** Support for electronic signatures (e.g., integration with platforms like DocuSign or native capabilities).
- **Obligation Management:** Ability to track key dates, milestones, and obligations within contracts.
- **Amendment & Renewal Management:** Processes and alerts for managing contract amendments and renewals.
- **Search & Retrieval:** Powerful search functionality (metadata, full-text search) to quickly locate contracts and specific clauses.
- **Expiration & Termination Tracking:** Automated alerts and reporting for upcoming contract expirations or termination dates.

### 3.2. AI Review Capabilities

- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Utilize AI/ML to automatically review contracts for risk identification (e.g., non-standard clauses, missing clauses, potential liabilities).
- **Clause Extraction & Comparison:** Automatically extract key clauses, terms, and metadata. Ability to compare clauses against standard templates or past agreements.
- **Compliance Monitoring:** AI-driven checks to ensure contracts comply with internal policies and external regulations.
- **Summarization:** AI capability to generate concise summaries of lengthy contracts.
- **Drafting Assistance:** AI suggestions for clauses, language consistency checks, and error reduction during drafting (as seen in Juro, Volody).

### 3.3. Integration Capabilities

- **CRM Integration:** Seamless integration with major CRM systems (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot) for data synchronization (customer data, contract status).
- **ERP Integration:** Integration with ERP systems (e.g., SAP, Oracle, NetSuite) for financial data, supplier information, etc.
- **eSignature Integration:** Integration with leading eSignature providers (if native eSignature is not sufficient).
- **Cloud Storage Integration:** Integration with common cloud storage platforms (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox).
- **API Access:** Availability of APIs for custom integrations with other business systems.

### 3.4. Reporting & Analytics

- **Dashboards:** Customizable dashboards providing real-time visibility into contract status, key metrics, upcoming deadlines, and potential risks.
- **Standard Reports:** Pre-built reports covering common CLM metrics (e.g., contract volume, cycle times, renewal rates).
- **Custom Reporting:** Ability to create custom reports based on various contract data points and metadata.
- **Performance Analytics:** Tools to analyze contract performance, identify bottlenecks in workflows, and track compliance.
- **Audit Trails:** Comprehensive audit trails tracking all actions performed on contracts for compliance and accountability.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The system should respond quickly, even with a large volume of contracts and users.
- **Support:** Availability of adequate customer support (e.g., documentation, knowledge base, email/phone support) suitable for US and India time zones.
- **Implementation:** Clear implementation process with potential vendor support or professional services available.
- **Training:** Availability of training materials or sessions for users.

## 5. Geographic Scope

- The solution must be fully functional and supported for users operating in the United States and India.
- Consideration should be given to compliance with specific legal and regulatory requirements in both countries.

## 6. Conclusion

This document provides a baseline for evaluating CMS solutions. Vendors should be assessed against these requirements, considering their specific offerings, pricing models, and suitability for an SMB context in the US and India. Further detailed technical specifications and vendor demonstrations will be required during the selection process.

# Contract Management Platform PRD

### TL;DR

A contract management platform enabling legal teams, sales, customers,
and partners to collaboratively draft, track, approve, and sign
contracts. Key features include robust version control, customizable
approval workflows, e-signature integration, automated deadline

  all created documents.

- Onboard at least 75% of the company’s legal and sales workflows within
  60 days.

- Decrease dependency on external contract management services,
  generating an estimated 30% operational cost savings.

## Narrative

Imagine Maya, a legal counsel, struggling to manage dozens of contract
emails between sales, clients, and partners. Deadlines are missed, the
wrong versions often get signed, and she wastes hours reconciling
contract edits and approvals. With the new Contract Management Platform,
Maya simply logs in, selects a template, and invites stakeholders to the
document—all in one place. Sales can fill in customer specifics, legal
can review with tracked changes, and the platform automatically logs
every edit. Approvals proceed according to routing rules, with instant
alerts for bottlenecks. When it’s time to sign, both internal and
external parties are guided through a seamless e-signature process, and
everyone receives an executed copy in their inbox and company archive.
As deadlines approach, the platform sends automated reminders,
drastically reducing renewals slipping through the cracks. In audits,
Maya accesses comprehensive logs to satisfy compliance officers, saving
days of painful manual work. The business sees faster deals, reduced
legal exposure, and a vastly improved experience for every user.
