# Project Management Software (Enterprise SaaS) – Product Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the **Product Requirements** for a SaaS-based **Project Management Software** targeted at enterprise teams. The product is a centralized platform to plan, execute, and monitor projects across an organization. It will support complex project planning needs, resource and budget management, and multiple project management methodologies (e.g. traditional waterfall and Agile) to accommodate different team workflows. Modern project management tools typically offer features such as project planning, resource allocation, budgeting, template reuse, progress monitoring, and productivity tracking ([Best Project Management Software: User Reviews from May 2025](https://www.g2.com/categories/project-management#:~:text=Common%20features%20include%20project%20planning%2C,monitoring%2C%20and%20user%20productivity%20tracking)). In line with these standards, this software will enable users to create detailed project plans (work breakdown structures), allocate resources efficiently, track budgets versus actual costs, and visualize project progress through various views and reports. The goal is to improve project outcomes by providing enterprise stakeholders (project managers, team members, executives, and partners) with the tools and insights needed to deliver projects on time and within budget, while maintaining high team productivity and data security.

## Scope

**In-Scope Features:** This product will provide end-to-end project management capabilities from planning through execution and tracking. Key features in scope include:

- **Project Planning & Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Tools to define project scope and break it down into a hierarchical set of phases, deliverables, tasks, subtasks, and milestones. Users can create project plans with WBS to ensure all work is accounted for (see **Functional Requirements** for details).
- **Resource Management & Allocation:** Functionality to manage human (and possibly other) resources, including a resource pool directory, resource availability calendars, assignment of resources to tasks, and tracking of resource utilization and workloads.
- **Budgeting & Cost Management:** Ability to create project budgets (planned costs) and track actual costs and expenses over the project’s life. The system will compare budget vs. actual to calculate variances and support financial control.
- **Multi-Methodology Support:** Support for multiple project management methodologies, primarily **waterfall** (phase-based, sequential planning with Gantt charts and critical path) and **agile** (iterative planning with backlogs, sprint tracking, and Kanban boards). Hybrid approaches can be configured as needed to combine elements of both.
- **Project Templates:** A library of project templates for common project types. Users can create new projects from templates or even merge/combine multiple templates to jumpstart planning. Templates are editable so teams can customize them to their needs.
- **Task Dependencies & Scheduling:** Tools to define dependencies between tasks (predecessors/successors) and automatically calculate scheduling impacts. Changes to one task’s schedule will propagate to dependent tasks, updating timelines and deadlines accordingly.
- **Critical Path Management:** Automatic identification and visualization of the project’s **critical path** – the longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines the project’s duration. The critical path should update dynamically when tasks or schedules change, so the project manager always knows which tasks are critical for on-time completion.
- **Bulk Task Operations:** Ability for users to perform mass updates on multiple tasks at once (e.g. changing statuses, assignees, or shifting deadlines for a group of tasks) without breaking the defined dependency relationships among tasks. This allows efficient editing of the plan while preserving project logic.
- **Multiple Project Views:** Multiple ways to view and present project data, such as a **calendar view** (tasks and milestones laid out by date), timeline or Gantt chart view, Kanban board view for tasks, and a **customer/partner view** that can be shared with external stakeholders. These views help different users (team members, managers, or clients) visualize the project in the format that suits them.
- **Monitoring & Reporting:** Real-time monitoring of project progress, resource utilization, and team productivity. Dashboards and reports will provide insights into key performance indicators – such as task completion status, milestone achievement, budget spent vs. budget planned, and individual/team workload or productivity metrics – to ensure the project stays on track.

**Out of Scope:** This PRD focuses on core project management functions and does not cover in-depth **portfolio management** (e.g. optimizing a portfolio of many projects) or specialized tools like bug tracking, CRM, or asset management – though integration with such systems is planned. Detailed UI designs (wireframes) are also not included, except for essential notes on user experience. The primary goal is to define what the product must do (requirements and capabilities) rather than how the UI is visually designed.

## Functional Requirements by Module

The functional requirements are organized by major modules or capability areas of the system. Each module’s section describes its purpose and lists specific functional requirements. Non-functional considerations specific to a module (if any) are noted, while broader non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.) are covered later under **Non-Functional Requirements**.

### Module 1: Project Planning & Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

**Description:** This module enables users to plan projects by defining their scope and breaking down the work into manageable components. A **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is a hierarchical decomposition of the project into phases, deliverables, tasks, and subtasks ([ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Project Management | The Workstream ](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/work-breakdown-structure#:~:text=A%20WBS%20in%20project%20management,into%20smaller%2C%20more%20efficient%20deliverables)). It serves as the foundation of project planning – ensuring that all work is identified and structured. A well-crafted WBS helps assign responsibilities efficiently and ensures no deadlines or tasks are overlooked ([ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Project Management | The Workstream ](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/work-breakdown-structure#:~:text=If%20you%20ever%20feel%20like,efficiently%20and%20don%E2%80%99t%20miss%20deadlines)). This module provides an interface (often a tree or outline view) for project managers to create and organize these elements, forming the project schedule’s backbone.

**Functional Requirements:**

- The system **shall allow creation of a new project plan** with a root element (the project itself) which can be broken down into an arbitrary number of **levels of hierarchy**. Users must be able to add **phases** (major stages of the project), which contain **tasks**, which in turn can have **sub-tasks**, and so on, down to work package level (smallest unit of work) ([ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Project Management | The Workstream ](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/work-breakdown-structure#:~:text=,They)). Each level represents a more granular breakdown of the work.
- The system **shall support defining deliverables and milestones** within the WBS. A **deliverable** is a tangible output of one or more tasks, and a **milestone** is a zero-duration marker indicating a significant event (e.g. phase completion). Users should be able to tag certain tasks or summary tasks as deliverables or milestones for tracking.
- Each task in the WBS **shall have attributes** including (but not limited to): title/name, description, start date, end/due date, duration (if auto-calculated from dates or manually set), predecessors (dependencies), assignee(s) or responsible resource, and status (not started, in progress, completed, etc.). For enterprise use, tasks may also have fields like priority, category, % complete, and custom fields as configured by administrators.
- Users **shall be able to expand or collapse** the WBS hierarchy to view various levels of detail. For example, one can collapse all subtasks to see only high-level phases/deliverables, or expand fully to see all work packages. This improves navigability in large project plans.
- **Editing the WBS structure** (adding, removing, or moving tasks) should be intuitive. Users shall be able to insert new tasks or sub-tasks at any level. Drag-and-drop functionality is highly desirable for reordering tasks or changing their parent/child relationships (e.g. converting a task into a subtask of another or vice versa) for ease of use.
- The software **shall automatically maintain numbering or coding** for WBS elements (if configured), such as “1.1.1” outline numbering for tasks, which updates as the hierarchy changes. This helps in referencing tasks in reports and ensuring each work item has a unique identifier.
- The WBS module **shall integrate with scheduling** logic (see **Task Dependencies & Scheduling** module) so that when tasks are added or changed, any timeline dates and the overall project schedule can update accordingly. However, the WBS view primarily focuses on the logical breakdown of work, so timeline adjustments might be done in a Gantt view – but the data model is shared.
- **Estimations:** The system should allow input of effort/cost estimates at the task or phase level (e.g. estimated hours or cost for a task). These estimates roll up the hierarchy (summed up to parent levels) to provide an estimated total project effort and cost ([ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Project Management | The Workstream ](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/work-breakdown-structure#:~:text=,or%20other%20important%20project%20goals)). This ties the WBS to resource and budget planning (e.g. a phase’s effort equals the sum of effort of its tasks).
- **Scope change management:** (Optional/advanced) The system could support marking certain WBS items as out of scope or parking lot (for items considered but not in current scope). While not strictly required, for enterprise use it can be useful to document scope exclusions within the plan.
- **Non-Functional Consideration (Usability):** The WBS editor should be responsive and handle large projects (hundreds or thousands of tasks) without performance lag. It should provide a clear visual indication of hierarchy (indentation, tree lines, or expand/collapse icons) so that the structure is easily understood by users ([10 Best Enterprise Project Management Software [2025]](https://www.smartsuite.com/blog/enterprise-project-management-software?105755a5_page=2#:~:text=Look%20for%20software%20that%20has,ask%20to%20make%20informed%20decisions)).

### Module 2: Resource Management & Allocation

**Description:** This module manages project resources – primarily human resources (team members, contractors, etc.), though it could also track other resource types (equipment, rooms, etc.) if needed. Effective resource management ensures that each task has an assigned owner and that no resource is over-allocated beyond availability. For enterprise teams, this module often interfaces with an organization-wide resource pool, allowing project managers to request or assign people to tasks based on their availability and skills. The goal is to **define, manage, and allocate resources based on demand and availability ([Best Project Management Software: User Reviews from May 2025](https://www.g2.com/categories/project-management#:~:text=Create%20project%20plans%20and%20work,based%20on%20the%20scope))**, so that project work is realistically planned and team workload is balanced.

**Functional Requirements:**

- The system **shall maintain a Resource Directory (Resource Pool)** accessible to project managers. This directory lists all resources (persons, and optionally equipment or other assets) available for assignment. For each resource, store attributes like name, role/department, location or time zone, skills/expertise, standard hourly rate (for cost calculations), and availability (e.g. full-time, 8h/day or custom schedule).
- The system **shall allow definition of resource calendars**. Each human resource can have a calendar specifying working days, holidays, and PTO (time off), so that availability is accurately reflected. The software should consider these calendars when scheduling tasks – for example, not assigning work on a day the resource is off.
- **Resource Assignment:** Users (typically Project Managers) shall be able to assign one or multiple resources to each task in the project plan. This links the task to the people responsible for doing the work. The interface might allow choosing from a list of resources or searching the resource pool by name/skill.
- When assigning a resource to a task, the system **shall allocate that task’s effort to the resource’s workload**. For example, if Task A is 5 days long (and perhaps estimated 40 hours of effort) and Resource X is assigned, Resource X’s schedule should show 8h per day on Task A for those 5 days (unless the allocation is split or partial). If multiple resources are assigned to one task, the task could either be treated as a team task (each gets portion of work) or as parallel full allocations – configuration on how to handle this (e.g. splitting the effort evenly) should be available.
- The system **shall provide a Resource Utilization view or report** where managers can see each resource’s current and upcoming workload. This could be a chart or calendar highlighting for each person the tasks assigned and any free capacity. The software must make it easy to identify over-allocations (when a person is assigned more work hours than available in a time period). For example, if a person is double-booked on two tasks at the same time, the system should flag this in red or provide an alert.
- **Resource Allocation based on Demand:** The tool should support scenarios where a project manager specifies a role or skill needed for a task (e.g. “Senior Developer, 80 hours needed in July”) and a Resource Manager or system can later assign a specific person to fulfill that demand. This allows planning with generic resources and staffing later – useful in enterprises where exact resources aren’t known during initial planning.
- **Resource Levelling:** (Optional advanced feature) The system may offer an automatic resource leveling function that can adjust task schedules to resolve over-allocation. For instance, if Resource Y is assigned to two tasks that overlap, the system could push one task’s start date out (within slack limits) to ensure Resource Y is not double-booked. Any such adjustments must respect task dependencies and constraints (and would likely require PM approval).
- **Resource Availability Queries:** Project managers should be able to find available resources for a given time window or task requirement. For example, a feature to “find next available developer for 5 days in June” can scan the resource pool and suggest who is free or has capacity. This is very useful in large teams to allocate work efficiently based on actual availability.
- **Role-Based Allocation:** The system shall allow defining roles (e.g. Designer, Engineer, QA) and assigning roles to tasks in cases where specific persons are not yet assigned. It should maintain resource-to-role mappings so that once a person is assigned, they fulfill the role requirement. This helps in early project planning by role before named resources are committed.
- **Integration with HR Systems:** (Integration point) It should be possible to import or sync the resource pool with an HR directory or single sign-on system to get the list of active employees and basic details, avoiding double data entry. (Detailed integration covered in a later section.)
- **Security/Permissions:** Only authorized users (Project Managers or Resource Managers) shall be allowed to assign or modify resources on a project. Team members typically can only view their own assignments, not reassign tasks. This ties into the user roles/permissions model (see **User Roles** section).
- **Non-Functional (Reporting):** The system should be able to **report on resource utilization** at various levels: per person, per role, per department, etc. For example, management might want to see a report of utilization % for all team members in a month, or identify the most heavily loaded teams. The resource module must thus store and expose data for such aggregate reporting ([10 Best Enterprise Project Management Software [2025]](https://www.smartsuite.com/blog/enterprise-project-management-software?105755a5_page=2#:~:text=,and%20report%20your%20resource%20utilization)) (e.g. how it helps allocate, manage, and report on resource utilization).

### Module 3: Budgeting & Cost Management

**Description:** This module focuses on the financial aspect of project management. Enterprise projects often have a planned **budget** that includes various cost components (labor, materials, software, etc.). This module allows the creation of a project budget and then tracking of **actual costs and expenses** incurred as the project progresses, enabling a comparison of budget vs. actual. By monitoring cost performance, project managers can control expenses and report on financial status. In project management terms, the module supports tracking **budget variance** – the difference between budgeted and actual cost ([Tracking Budget Variance in Project Management](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/budget-variance#:~:text=probability%20theory%20and%20statistics,cost%20of%20executing%20the%20project)) – and other cost metrics to ensure the project is delivered within its financial constraints.

**Functional Requirements:**

- The system **shall allow defining a project budget** at the appropriate level of detail. At minimum, a total project budget (overall amount allocated) can be set. Additionally, the system should support breaking the budget down into categories such as labor, materials, travel, contingency, etc., or by WBS component (e.g. budget per phase or per task). For example, a project might have a $500,000 budget, broken into $300k labor, $200k other costs. Users should be able to input these figures.
- **Cost Estimation on Tasks:** Each task or work package can have an estimated cost. If labor costs are a factor, the system can calculate estimated cost = estimated effort (hours) \* resource bill rate. Non-labor costs (fixed costs per task) can also be entered (e.g. a task “Purchase equipment” might have a fixed $50k cost). These estimates roll up to summary tasks and the project level, yielding a **forecasted cost** which can be compared to the set budget.
- **Tracking Actual Costs:** The system **shall provide a way to input actual costs** incurred for tasks and the project. This could be through:
  - _Time Tracking Integration:_ If team members log hours spent on tasks (via timesheets or task updates), the system can calculate labor cost by multiplying hours \* hourly rate for the resource.
  - _Expense Entry:_ Project managers or designated users can enter expenses (one-off or recurring) associated with tasks or at the project level. For example, if an invoice of $10k for equipment arrives, they record it against the relevant task or category.
  - _External Integration:_ Alternately, actual cost data could flow in from an accounting system integration – e.g., linking project tasks to cost items in ERP. (Integration handling detailed later.)
- **Budget vs Actual Comparison:** The system **shall automatically compare actual costs to the budget**. It should calculate **budget variance** both at the overall project level and for subcomponents (if budget breakdowns are provided). For instance, if the budget for a phase was $100k and actual costs recorded so far for that phase are $120k, the variance is -$20k (over budget). This information should be readily visible (perhaps in a budget dashboard or report). According to project management best practices, monitoring this variance helps ensure the project isn’t exceeding its financial limits ([Tracking Budget Variance in Project Management](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/budget-variance#:~:text=match%20at%20L229%20Budget%20variance,it%20eats%20into%20the%20general)).
- **Alerts for Over-Budget Conditions:** The software shall provide notifications or visual alerts when costs approach or exceed the budget. For example, if 90% of the budget is consumed while the project is only 50% complete in timeline, that is a warning sign – the system could flag this in reports or send an alert to the project manager. Thresholds for such alerts might be configurable.
- **Multiple Budget Versions/Baselines:** The system should allow setting a **budget baseline** (the original approved budget) and possibly track revisions. Enterprise projects might re-baseline budgets if scope changes. The PRD should note that maintaining at least one baseline vs current budget is needed for change control. Similarly, the project’s schedule baseline (for time) might be stored – that ties more to scheduling module but cost baseline is analogous.
- **Financial Reports:** Provide standard reports such as _Budget Status Report_ (showing budget, actual, and variance by category or by WBS element), _Cost Trend_ over time, etc. The data should also be exportable (e.g. to CSV or Excel) for financial analysis outside the tool if needed.
- **Currency and Rates:** The system shall support at least one currency (USD by default) for cost tracking. Ideally, for global teams, allow specifying currency and conversion rates or handling multiple currencies (this could be a complex feature; minimally, all costs can be recorded in a single currency in this version). Resource bill rates should be configurable per resource (or role) and possibly time-phased (if a resource’s rate changes year to year).
- **Expense Approvals:** (Optional) For enterprise governance, an optional workflow could be included for approving certain expenses or budgets. For example, if a PM tries to approve an invoice that exceeds a threshold, it might require a higher manager’s approval. This adds complexity and may interface with procurement systems – mention as a consideration but not mandatory in MVP.
- **Non-Functional:** The budgeting calculations (summing up costs, etc.) should be performed in near real-time for reasonably sized projects. The design should ensure that even if a project has thousands of cost entries, the performance of generating a budget vs actual report is acceptable (possibly by pre-aggregating data). Also, data accuracy is paramount – financial data must be stored with proper precision (cents) and audit trails (who entered/changed what cost) for accountability.

### Module 4: Multi-Methodology Support (Waterfall & Agile)

([ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Project Management | The Workstream ](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/work-breakdown-structure))_Example: A Kanban board view for agile project management. This software will allow teams to manage projects in Agile mode with boards and backlogs, or in Waterfall mode with phases and Gantt charts, depending on their methodology._

Enterprise teams often use different **project management methodologies**. This module ensures the product supports both **waterfall** (traditional, sequential planning) and **agile** (iterative, incremental) approaches, as well as combinations (hybrid). The software should not force one methodology; instead it provides features and views tailored to each so that teams can choose the most appropriate for their projects ([
Service - TeamDynamix Project Portfol...
](https://services.pitt.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=221#:~:text=,schedule%2C%20and%20assign%20tasks%20within)). This flexibility is key for enterprise adoption – one project might follow a strict phase-gate process, while another uses Scrum sprints and Kanban boards. The system will accommodate both, maintaining underlying data consistency.

**Functional Requirements:**

- **Project Mode Configuration:** When creating a new project in the system, the user (project manager) should be able to specify the methodology or template to use. For example, they can choose _“Waterfall project”_ vs _“Agile project”_ (or select a specific template that is waterfall or agile in nature). This selection will configure which features and views are primarily used. (E.g., a waterfall project might enable Gantt timeline as the main planning interface, whereas an agile project might enable backlog and board views by default.)
- **Waterfall Support:** For traditional projects, the software shall support:
  - _Phase-based WBS:_ Breaking the project into phases/stages and tasks (as covered in WBS module).
  - _Gantt Chart Timeline:_ A timeline view that shows tasks with bars spanning their start-end dates, with dependencies lines (see **Multiple Views** section). This is the classic planning tool for waterfall, allowing managers to see the schedule and adjust it.
  - _Critical Path:_ Automatic calculation of critical path (detailed in its module) to identify schedule risks in a waterfall plan.
  - _Milestone Tracking:_ Mark key milestones and possibly handle _phase gates_ (points where approval is needed to proceed to next phase). The software should allow noting such quality gates, though enforcement might be procedural.
  - _Baseline & Change Control:_ Support capturing a baseline schedule and comparing actual timeline against it (e.g., to see slippage). This is a waterfall-centric practice to measure performance.
- **Agile Support:** For agile projects, the software shall support:
  - _Backlog Management:_ Ability to maintain a backlog of work items (user stories, features, tasks, bugs, etc.) for the project. Backlog items have attributes like description, priority, story points (if using Scrum), etc.
  - _Iteration/Sprint Planning:_ The ability to group subset of backlog items into an iteration (sprint) with a fixed duration. Users (Scrum Masters, PMs) should be able to create a Sprint, set its start/end dates, and move a set of backlog items into that sprint for execution. The system should track sprint progress (how many story points or tasks completed vs remaining).
  - _Kanban Boards:_ A **Kanban board view** where tasks (or user stories) are visualized as cards moving through columns representing workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done). This is illustrated above ([ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Project Management | The Workstream ](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/work-breakdown-structure#:~:text=Kanban%20is%20a%20visual%20method,to%20indicate%20different%20workflow%20stages)). The system shall allow customizing the board columns to fit the team’s process. Team members can drag cards across columns as work progresses, and all changes reflect back in the task data (status, etc.).
  - _Agile Metrics:_ Provide common agile metrics such as burn-down charts (showing work remaining vs time in a sprint), burn-up charts, or cumulative flow diagrams (in Kanban) to help agile teams monitor their pace and adjust.
  - _Epics and Hierarchy:_ In larger agile projects, support the notion of epics (large user stories or groups of stories) which can be broken down into smaller stories/tasks (maintaining a hierarchy, somewhat analogous to WBS but in agile terms).
- **Hybrid Usage:** The tool should not silo the methodologies completely; it’s beneficial if projects can mix elements. For instance, an overall project could have a high-level phase plan (waterfall style) but within a phase, use agile sprints for development. To support this, the software could allow enabling both sets of features on a project. For example, one could maintain a backlog for a phase of the project while still having that phase on the master Gantt timeline. This is complex but at minimum, the system should allow switching a project’s methodology if needed (perhaps with administrative settings).
- **Templates for Each Methodology:** Provide out-of-the-box project templates for common frameworks – e.g., a “Scrum project template” (with pre-made sprints and backlog items placeholders), a “Waterfall project template” (with example phases and milestone structure), etc. This ties into the Templates module but specific to methodology.
- **Consistent Data Model:** Ensure that whether tasks are managed via agile boards or traditional Gantt, they ultimately use a unified data structure so that higher-level reporting (across all projects) is possible. For example, even if a team is using a Kanban board, behind the scenes those are tasks with start/end dates (perhaps implicit) so that an executive could still view all projects’ status uniformly. This might involve some assumptions (e.g., sprint end date becomes due date for all tasks in it, etc.).
- **Role-Based Views:** In practice, some roles prefer one methodology’s view over another. The software could permit different members of the same project to view it differently. _E.g._, a development team member might work from the Kanban board, while a senior manager might look at a high-level Gantt for the same project. To enable this, the project could maintain both representations in sync. (This is an advanced capability – minimally, ensure data isn’t lost when switching views).
- **Non-Functional:** The system should **encourage best practices** of each methodology via its UI and defaults. For instance, when setting up an Agile project, prompt for sprint length; for waterfall, prompt to set dependencies or baselines. Additionally, methodology-specific terms should be used appropriately in the UI (e.g., use “Sprint” not “Iteration” if Scrum is selected, etc., possibly allowing terminology customization). Guidance or help articles might be linked for teams less familiar with one approach.

### Module 5: Project Templates

**Description:** This module provides **project templates** that can be used to quickly create new projects with a predefined structure. Templates save time by capturing best-practice task breakdowns for common project types (for example, a template for “Software Implementation Project” might include typical phases and tasks). For enterprise use, templates also help enforce standards across projects. Additionally, the requirement specifies the ability to modify or combine templates to create new project plans, meaning users can start with a base template and then customize it, or even merge multiple templates if a project covers multiple domains.

**Functional Requirements:**

- The system **shall include a library of pre-built project templates**. These templates are essentially prototype projects with predefined WBS structures, possibly resource role placeholders, and maybe sample durations. They could be industry-specific or use-case-specific (e.g., “New Product Launch”, “Marketing Campaign”, “Software Development – Agile Sprint 0”, etc.). At minimum, provide a few generic ones (e.g., “Waterfall Project Template”, “Agile Project Template” as mentioned).
- Users shall be able to **create a new project from a template** in one step. For example, a “Create Project” dialog lets the user choose a template. The resulting project will contain all tasks, phases, and milestones that the template defined, which the user can then adjust (dates, assignments, etc.).
- The system **shall allow editing a template or creating custom templates**. Authorized users (perhaps only admins or experienced PMs) can take an existing project plan and save it as a new template, or build a template from scratch. This is crucial for organizations to codify their standard project plans. Template editing should be similar to editing a regular project, but saved in the template library rather than as an active project.
- **Combining Templates:** The software shall support merging or combining templates to form a project. Two possible approaches:
  - _Starting with multiple templates:_ When creating a project, allow selecting more than one template. The system would then import all tasks from both templates into the new project. If there are overlapping sections (e.g., both templates have an “Initiation” phase), the tool might either merge those or list them separately – rules for merging should be defined (perhaps simplest is to just add them sequentially or under separate top-level nodes).
  - _Importing template into an existing project:_ After a project is created (maybe started from one template), user can import another template’s tasks into it. For example, if a project needs to include an “Infrastructure Setup” segment and there’s a template for that, the PM can insert that template’s tasks into the current plan. The system should maintain dependencies of the inserted tasks internally, but also allow the PM to link these into the existing tasks as needed.
- **Template Modification in Use:** When a project is created from a template, it is not rigid – users must be able to modify the project freely (add/delete tasks, change structure). The template serves as a starting point, not a locked plan. The system will **not** enforce updates from the template after project creation (i.e., if the template is later updated, existing projects from it need not change). This is to ensure projects can diverge as necessary.
- **Versioning of Templates:** (Optional) For governance, it might be useful if templates have version numbers or last-updated metadata. If a template changes, new projects use the updated version, but we may want to record which version a project was created from (for audit or improvement feedback). This is a nice-to-have detail.
- **Template Metadata:** Each template should have metadata like name, description (what type of project it’s for), expected duration, recommended team size, etc., to help users pick the right one. Possibly also tags or categorization (by department or industry).
- **Permissions:** Not all users can create or alter templates. Typically, template management might be restricted to PMO or administrators. Regular project managers can use templates to create projects, but perhaps not create new templates unless given rights. This should align with role permissions.
- **Out-of-the-box vs Custom:** The product will ship with some default templates (as mentioned), but enterprises will want to create their own to match their processes. The PRD should emphasize ease of creating and maintaining custom templates as a key capability (since it encourages standardization).
- **Combining Templates Safely:** When merging templates, the system should ensure no duplicate unique IDs or conflicts. Perhaps tasks from template B get new IDs when inserted into project A. If both templates have resources or roles defined that differ, ensure those are integrated (e.g., if template A had a role “Designer” and template B had none, fine; if both had role “Designer”, they should map to the same concept in the merged project). This may require prompting the user if there are conflicts.
- **Non-Functional:** Template application should be fast – creating a project from a template with, say, 200 tasks should happen within seconds. Also, the template library interface should be user-friendly, possibly with search and preview (e.g., seeing a summary of the tasks in the template before choosing it). Maintaining a large number of templates (dozens) should be organized (maybe allow categories or folders of templates).

### Module 6: Task Dependencies & Scheduling

**Description:** This module deals with the scheduling engine of the project management tool – how tasks are sequenced and how changes propagate. **Task dependencies** link tasks together (finish-to-start, start-to-start, etc.), meaning one task’s timing affects another. This module ensures the system can manage these interdependencies between tasks and calculate their impact on deadlines. In conjunction with the WBS and resource modules, the scheduling functionality produces a coherent project timeline. When any task’s dates or duration change, the system should update affected tasks and possibly the overall project end date. The result is a dynamic schedule that reflects the current state of the project at all times.

**Functional Requirements:**

- The system **shall support defining dependencies between tasks**. At minimum, support the classic Finish-to-Start (FS) dependency: Task B cannot start until Task A finishes. Additionally, for completeness, support other dependency types: Start-to-Start (tasks can start together), Finish-to-Finish, and Start-to-Finish (less common). Users can link any two tasks with a dependency relationship. This is usually done in a Gantt or table view by selecting predecessor tasks for a given task.
- **Lag and Lead:** The system should allow specifying a lag (delay) or lead (overlap) on a dependency. E.g., Task B starts 3 days after Task A finishes (lag of 3 days), or Task B can start 2 days before Task A finishes (lead of 2 days, effectively overlapping). This adds flexibility in scheduling real-world conditions.
- **Automatic Scheduling Calculation:** Once dependencies are set, the software **shall automatically schedule tasks** based on those links and task durations. If Task A (predecessor) actual finish date is later than initially planned, Task B’s start (successor) should automatically push out to maintain the dependency. This is the core of a **dynamic scheduling engine**: any change in task timing causes recalculation of the schedule forward (and possibly backward for critical path, see next module).
- **Impact on Deadlines:** If a task has a fixed deadline (must finish by a certain date) and its dependencies shift it beyond that date, the system should flag a missed deadline or constraint violation. Likewise, if dependencies cause the overall project end date to move past the desired end date, that should be clearly indicated. The user can then take corrective action (e.g., compress tasks, add resources, etc.). Essentially, the software makes the impact of any delay visible to the manager.
- **Manual vs Automatic Modes:** Ideally, the tool provides a scheduling mode setting: fully automatic (as described above) or manual scheduling (where dates can be decoupled from dependency logic). Some enterprise PMs prefer manual control for certain tasks. In automatic mode, changes propagate to all dependent tasks. In manual mode, the system might just warn about misalignments but not move tasks unless the user explicitly agrees. This PRD will assume automatic scheduling as the default, with manual adjustments possible if the user overrides.
- **Dependency Loops Check:** The system must prevent circular dependencies (loops) which can make scheduling impossible. If a user accidentally tries to link tasks in a loop, the UI should block it and inform them of the conflict.
- **Milestone Dependencies:** Milestones can also be predecessors or successors in dependencies. If a milestone (zero-duration) is a successor, it essentially marks when all predecessors are done. If it’s a predecessor, it means some tasks can’t start until that milestone is reached (often used for phase gates). The scheduling engine should treat milestones logically in the chain of dependencies.
- **Cross-Project Dependencies:** (Advanced enterprise feature) If multiple projects are managed in the system, allow linking a task in Project X to a task in Project Y as a dependency. For example, Project X Task A (deliverable) must finish before Project Y Task B can start. This is crucial in a portfolio environment to manage inter-project dependencies. The system should allow selecting an external project task as a predecessor and should reflect changes across projects. (If cross-project dependencies are too advanced for initial version, at least document as a roadmap feature).
- **Calendar Awareness:** The scheduling calculations must respect non-working days (from resource calendars and perhaps a project calendar). If a dependency dictates a task starts the next day after predecessor ends, and that day is a Sunday (non-working), the task should actually start on Monday. The system should incorporate calendars so schedules are realistic.
- **Critical Path Visibility:** While critical path is detailed next, the scheduling engine inherently identifies which tasks control the project end date. The system should internally mark which tasks have zero slack (i.e., are on the critical path) and which have float. This is used for highlighting critical tasks (see next module).
- **Slack/Float Calculation:** For each task, especially in a waterfall context, the system should compute _total float_ (how much it can delay without affecting the project end or a constrained date) and _free float_ (how much it can delay without affecting its immediate successor). This information is useful for project managers to know flexibility. It is derived from the dependency graph plus constraints. Include this in advanced scheduling details (perhaps accessible in a task details view or report).
- **What-If Analysis:** (Optional) Provide ability to do “what-if” changes to the schedule (like temporarily modifying a duration or dependency) to see impact without permanently changing the plan. This might be done via a scenario or simulation mode, or by saving a copy. Not a strict requirement but worth noting for enterprise users who do contingency planning.
- **Mass Rescheduling:** If a major event occurs (e.g., a project start is delayed by a month before it begins), the system should allow a mass shift of the entire schedule. For instance, a “Shift timeline” function that moves all tasks by +30 days. This must also keep dependencies intact relative to each other (they will, if tasks all move together). This is related to bulk update (Module 8), but specifically for dates.
- **Non-Functional (Performance):** The scheduling engine should handle large projects (say up to 1000+ tasks with many dependencies) efficiently. Changing one task date should recompute the schedule in a second or two at most, not freeze the application. This might mean using efficient algorithms for critical path calculation and not performing redundant computations.
- **Non-Functional (Transparency):** The system should provide visual cues of dependency links (e.g., arrows in Gantt view) and possibly an interface (like a “Predecessors/Successors” list in task details) so users can easily see and navigate dependency relationships. Understanding the chain of linked tasks is important for managers to trust the scheduling.

### Module 7: Critical Path Auto-Generation

**Description:** This module highlights the **Critical Path Method (CPM)** functionality of the software. The critical path is the sequence of dependent tasks that determine the earliest completion date of the project ([Use Critical Path Method (CPM) for Project Management [2025] • Asana](https://asana.com/resources/critical-path-method#:~:text=Also%20called%20critical%20path%20analysis,will%20delay%20the%20whole%20project)). Any delay in a critical path task will directly delay the project’s finish. The software will automatically calculate this path from the network of task dependencies and update it whenever the schedule changes. By identifying critical tasks, project managers can focus on those that are most time-sensitive. This module ties closely with the scheduling engine but is singled out due to its importance in project planning and tracking.

**Functional Requirements:**

- The system **shall automatically identify the critical path** for a project schedule. Based on all tasks, durations, and dependencies, it will determine the longest path from project start to finish (or to a key milestone if configured). This calculation should occur whenever there is a change in the schedule (task added, duration changed, task completed early or late, etc.).
- **Visual Highlighting:** The critical path tasks should be visually distinguishable in timeline views (e.g., on the Gantt chart, tasks on the critical path could be shown in a different color or with a special icon). This provides immediate insight to the user about which tasks are critical. For example, ProjectManager.com’s Gantt charts allow filtering to show only critical tasks ([Critical Path Software - ProjectManager](https://www.projectmanager.com/software/critical-path#:~:text=Image%3A%20Filter%20for%20the%20critical,critical%20path%20software%20%20106)). Our tool should have a similar capability – perhaps a filter or a toggle “Highlight Critical Path”.
- **Multiple Critical Paths:** If a project has multiple end points or multiple independent chains, the system should identify all critical paths (sometimes there can be more than one path of equal length). It should highlight all tasks that have zero float as critical.
- **Re-calculation on Updates:** When tasks are updated (e.g., a predecessor finishes early or late), the software shall re-calc the critical path dynamically. For instance, if a non-critical task gets delayed and becomes critical due to lost slack, the system will update its status to critical path. This ensures the PM always sees the current critical tasks.
- **Critical Path Analysis Reports:** Provide a report or list of tasks on the critical path, including their slack (which would be zero) and perhaps their sequence (the chain of tasks). This can help in communicating which tasks are driving the schedule.
- **Integration with Project Timeline:** The critical path essentially determines the project end date. The system should clearly display the projected project completion date based on current data, which is the finish date of the last task on the critical path. If there’s a target completion date set by the user, the system can show variance between target vs current critical path completion.
- **“What-If” for Critical Path:** Project managers might want to see how changes could shorten the critical path. While actual what-if simulation is complex, the tool could assist by, for example, highlighting which tasks if shortened would reduce the overall timeline. This is more of an analytical aid (not a strict requirement but a possible value-add). For instance, an algorithm could compute the sensitivity of project duration to each task’s duration.
- **Include/Exclude certain tasks:** In some cases, users might want to exclude certain tasks from critical path consideration (for example, an ongoing external process that is tracked but not gating the project deliverable). The software could allow marking tasks as “inactive” or “external” so they don’t affect timeline calculations. But by default, all active tasks count.
- **Milestone path:** If the project has an end milestone, critical path is up to that milestone. If there are intermediate deliverables, perhaps allow calculation of critical path to each major milestone as well, if needed, for sub-deadlines. This can be done via setting the milestone as project finish in a filtered sense.
- **User Guidance:** Given not all users are scheduling experts, the software might provide a brief explanation or help tooltip on what the critical path is and why certain tasks are highlighted as critical (educational aspect). This can reduce confusion for those new to the concept. According to Asana’s guide, the CPM technique maps out key tasks needed to complete the project and shows that any delay on those tasks delays the project ([Use Critical Path Method (CPM) for Project Management [2025] • Asana](https://asana.com/resources/critical-path-method#:~:text=The%20critical%20path%20method%20is,path%20for%20your%20next%20project)) ([Use Critical Path Method (CPM) for Project Management [2025] • Asana](https://asana.com/resources/critical-path-method#:~:text=Also%20called%20critical%20path%20analysis,will%20delay%20the%20whole%20project)) – our UI notes can reflect that concept for user clarity.
- **Non-Functional:** The critical path calculation must be efficient – typically it involves a forward and backward pass through the task network, which is O(n + m) for n tasks and m dependencies, which should be fine even for large n. The system should handle recalculations quickly after each relevant change. Also, reliability is important: the algorithm must always correctly identify the critical tasks (extensively tested for edge cases). The results should match what a seasoned PM would expect for confidence in the tool.

### Module 8: Bulk Task Update Operations

**Description:** This module provides the capability to **mass update tasks** – a productivity feature for project managers handling large plans. Often, project data needs to be edited in bulk (for example, pushing all tasks in a phase out by one week, or marking a bunch of tasks as completed). Doing so one by one is tedious, so bulk operations are crucial. The requirement emphasizes that bulk updates should not inadvertently break the task interdependencies. In other words, when multiple tasks are updated together, their relative dependency structure remains intact unless intentionally changed.

**Functional Requirements:**

- The system **shall allow multi-select of tasks** in the UI (e.g., using checkboxes or Shift+Click to select a range, or filtering a set of tasks) for performing bulk actions. In a WBS or task list view, a user might select several tasks from different parts of the hierarchy; in a Gantt view, perhaps lasso select multiple bars; in a board, select multiple cards, etc.
- **Bulk Edit Attributes:** Users can edit a field for all selected tasks at once. For example, change the status of all selected tasks to “Completed”, or assign the same user to a group of tasks in one action, or move all selected tasks’ due date by +2 days. The system will apply the change to each task in the selection.
- **Maintaining Dependencies:** When performing bulk date changes, the system must maintain dependency constraints. For instance, if the user selects an entire chain of dependent tasks and shifts them all later by 1 week, this is straightforward (they all move together, preserving gaps). If the selection is arbitrary (not a contiguous chain), the system should still respect link logic. For example, if Task A and Task C are selected but Task B (in between them in dependency) is not, and user delays both A and C by 3 days: The result should be that A moves by 3 days; B (not selected) would typically also move if A is a predecessor (due to scheduling rules) – so B moves automatically by dependency; then C (selected) moves by 3 days on top of whatever shift came from B. This can be complex to communicate, but essentially, the scheduling engine runs as normal during bulk edits. The product should ensure no dependency is inadvertently removed or overridden by bulk operations.
- **Bulk Move in Hierarchy:** Users may want to move a group of tasks to another phase or under a different parent. The tool should support multi-select then drag/drop to a new location in the WBS. All selected tasks (and their subtrees, if any) should relocate as a block. Dependencies that exist among those tasks remain, and any dependencies to tasks outside the moved block remain linked (they may now point to tasks in a new section but that’s fine). This operation should keep all internal relationships intact.
- **Bulk Delete:** Allow deletion of a selection of tasks in one action (with appropriate warning, especially if those tasks have dependencies or actuals). If tasks with dependents are deleted, we must decide how to handle the chain – likely if Task A -> Task B -> Task C and B is deleted, the system should optionally link A -> C to preserve a logical chain (or at least warn user to fix dependencies). It may be simplest to disallow deleting tasks that have dependencies unless those dependencies are also selected for deletion.
- **Bulk Dependency Edit:** Possibly, allow adding or removing a dependency link to multiple tasks at once. For example, a PM might want to set the same predecessor for 5 tasks (they all depend on Task Z). Rather than linking each individually, a bulk action could be “set Task Z as predecessor for all selected tasks.” Conversely, remove a particular predecessor from all selected tasks, etc. This could save time in large schedules.
- **Bulk Properties Assignment:** Other examples include tagging multiple tasks with a label or category in one go, copying/pasting a set of tasks, or changing all selected tasks to a different phase or component (if using some categorical field).
- **Undo/Review:** Because bulk changes can affect many tasks, providing an _Undo_ feature or a summary review before confirmation is important. The system could show “You are about to change 10 tasks: list of tasks… Confirm?” to avoid accidents. If something goes wrong, an undo (single-step revert of that bulk operation) is very valuable.
- **Performance:** Bulk operations should be optimized. Updating 100 tasks at once should not trigger 100 separate save operations and 100 dependency recalculations individually if it can be batched. Ideally, the system processes the bulk change as a transaction, then recalculates the schedule once at the end (if possible) to improve speed.
- **No Interference with Dependencies Setting:** The requirement _“without changing interdependencies”_ implies that using bulk update should not, for example, wipe out or arbitrarily alter dependency links. Our above considerations ensure links remain intact. The scheduling adjustments that happen are not considered “changing interdependencies” – they are enforcing them. The core point is that after bulk update, the dependency graph among tasks is the same as before (unless the user explicitly was doing a dependency change action).
- **Permission:** Bulk edits should obey permission levels – e.g., only a user who can edit all those tasks individually could perform a bulk edit on them. If some selected tasks are not editable (say they belong to another manager’s project or are locked), the system should either disallow those selections or skip those tasks with a notification.
- **Bulk via Import/Export:** Another angle: the system might allow exporting tasks to Excel, doing changes, and re-importing. When re-importing, that essentially is a bulk update. The software should be able to reconcile such changes in a way that doesn’t break dependencies (for example, if one inadvertently removes a dependency in Excel and re-imports, the system should treat that carefully). This may be complex; a safer approach is to restrict certain fields via import. However, for completeness, mention that administrators might bulk edit via data import or API as well (discussed in API section).

### Module 9: Multiple Project Views (Calendars, Timelines, etc.)

**Description:** This module covers the various **views or visualizations** the software will provide for project data. Different stakeholders prefer different views – e.g., a detailed Gantt chart for a PM, a calendar for someone interested in dates, a board for the team’s day-to-day tasks, or a simplified timeline for an executive or customer. The requirement specifically mentions a **calendar view** and a **customer/partner view**, but the intent is to have multiple ways to look at the same project information. This improves usability and communication, as each view can highlight certain aspects without altering the underlying project data.

([ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Project Management | The Workstream ](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/work-breakdown-structure))_Example: Timeline/Roadmap view of project items across a calendar. Multiple views (like calendar or timeline) will help users and stakeholders visualize schedules in different formats._

**Functional Requirements:**

- **Gantt Chart (Timeline) View:** The classic project timeline view with a time scale (weeks/months) on the horizontal axis and tasks on the vertical axis. Each task is represented by a bar spanning from start to end date, with dependencies shown as connecting lines ([ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Project Management | The Workstream ](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/work-breakdown-structure#:~:text=Calendars%20in%20project%20management%20provide,deadlines%2C%20milestones%2C%20and%20resource%20availability)) ([ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Project Management | The Workstream ](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/work-breakdown-structure#:~:text=The%20key%20components%20of%20WBS,include%20the%20following)). This view is essential for waterfall projects and for overall schedule visualization. Users should be able to pan/zoom the timeline, and drag task bars to adjust dates (with the scheduling rules applied). It should also display milestones (as diamond icons, for example) and possibly the critical path highlighted.
- **Calendar View:** A view that places tasks, milestones, or deadlines on a calendar layout (month/week grid). This gives a time-based perspective focusing on dates. For example, one could switch to a monthly calendar to see what deadlines or events are coming up each week ([ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Project Management | The Workstream ](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/work-breakdown-structure#:~:text=Image%3A%20Jira%20calendar%20view)). Tasks with durations spanning multiple days might appear as bars across those days in the calendar. The calendar view helps ensure tasks are completed within their set timeframes and helps track deadlines and resource availability in a familiar format ([ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Project Management | The Workstream ](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/work-breakdown-structure#:~:text=Calendars%20in%20project%20management%20provide,deadlines%2C%20milestones%2C%20and%20resource%20availability)). It’s ideal for users who think in terms of calendar dates (perhaps executives or team members managing personal schedules).
- **Kanban Board View:** As described under agile support, a board view shows tasks as cards in columns (typically by status or stage). This view is great for team members to manage their work-in-progress. It should allow drag-and-drop of cards between columns to update status, quick editing of task details, and possibly show assignee avatars or task metadata on cards. This view is mostly for those executing the work (developers, etc.) in an agile or task-oriented setting.
- **List or Table View:** A spreadsheet-like list of tasks (potentially grouped by phase or filtered). Some users (especially in enterprise) like a sortable, filterable grid of all tasks with columns for each field. This can be used for quick editing (inline) and is accessible to those who prefer text to visuals. It’s also useful for exporting or printing.
- **Dashboard (Summary) View:** This might not list tasks, but rather show high-level project metrics: percent complete, number of tasks done vs pending, budget used, etc., with charts. However, dashboards are covered in Monitoring module. We can mention here that an “Executive view” for the project could be a mini-dashboard plus key milestones timeline.
- **Customer/Partner View:** A specialized view (or set of permissions leading to a limited view) intended for external stakeholders (clients, partners) who need insight into the project but not all internal details. This view likely shows a **simplified project timeline or status report** – for instance, a milestone chart or a high-level Gantt with only top phases and milestones, plus progress info. It might hide granular tasks or sensitive information (like individual resource assignments or detailed budget info) that internal team sees. The view could be accessible via a secure shareable link or an external user login with read-only access to that specific project. Key features of a partner view:
  - Only includes tasks or milestones flagged as “share with customer” (the PM can mark which items are externally visible).
  - Overall project percent complete, upcoming milestones, any risks or issues (if we include that) that the team wants to share. Possibly a comment section for updates.
  - No editing allowed by the external viewer except maybe commenting or attaching queries.
  - This view ensures transparency with clients without overwhelming or exposing internal data.
- **Portfolio/Program View:** (If multiple projects) Possibly a timeline that shows multiple projects against each other (for a program manager). Though not explicitly asked, enterprise context often requires some multi-project overview. We mention it briefly: e.g., a “Portfolio timeline view” that places each project as a bar or band in a schedule to see overlap and resource conflicts. Or a portfolio dashboard summarizing all projects. This might be beyond scope of this single-project-focused PRD but worth noting as future extension.
- **Customization of Views:** Users should be able to filter and configure each view. For example, in Gantt view, filter to a specific phase or team; in calendar, choose to see only milestones vs all tasks; in board, possibly swimlanes by assignee; in list, sort by due date, etc. The ability to save custom views or filters (per user) could greatly help large teams. For instance, a user might save a view “My Tasks due this week” as a personal list.
- **Switching Views:** Switching between these views should be straightforward (tabs or a menu). The data shown is the same project, just represented differently. Changes made in one view reflect in others. For example, moving a task’s date on the calendar or Gantt updates it in the list and board as well; moving a card to “Done” on Kanban marks the task complete, which updates its bar color on the Gantt and possibly strikes it out on list, etc. This real-time sync is crucial for consistency.
- **Calendars and Resource Views:** In addition to project-centric views, consider a **Resource calendar view** where you see for each day which tasks each resource is doing (like a team calendar). Or a **Workload view** (often a heatmap or chart of resource utilization by week). Those might come under Resource Management module, but we can list them here as part of multiple ways to view project data (resource-centric vs task-centric views).
- **Integration of Views into Dashboard:** Users might want to see multiple views side by side (e.g., Gantt and board for an agile project). Possibly allow opening multiple project views concurrently in different tabs of the app or as parts of a dashboard. This can be a future enhancement.
- **Non-Functional (UI):** Each view should be designed for clarity and performance. For example, Gantt view should handle large task counts by virtualization (loading only visible tasks), board view should allow smooth dragging even if many cards, calendar view should not clutter too many entries on one date (maybe show +n more if overflow). The design must ensure readability – e.g., color coding to differentiate task categories or overdue tasks highlighted in red on all views. Accessibility in all views (keyboard nav, screen reader support) is also important (see UI/UX notes).

### Module 10: Monitoring & Reporting (Progress, Utilization, Productivity)

**Description:** This module provides features to **monitor project progress and performance** and to generate reports for stakeholders. Monitoring includes tracking how the project is advancing relative to plan (schedule progress and budget consumption), how resources are utilized, and even how individual users or teams are performing (productivity). The system will gather data from the execution of the project (tasks completed, hours logged, etc.) and present it in dashboards and reports. The aim is to give project managers and enterprise leadership visibility into the health of the project at any given time, enabling proactive management. According to industry expectations, project management software should offer real-time status updates and insight into how time is spent by each person or team to improve efficiency ([Best Project Management Software: User Reviews from May 2025](https://www.g2.com/categories/project-management#:~:text=Project%20management%20software%20streamlines%20project,efficiency%20at%20an%20organizational%20level)).

**Functional Requirements:**

- **Project Dashboard:** The software shall provide a project dashboard with key summary metrics and visualizations. Examples of metrics to display: overall % of tasks completed, number of tasks overdue, current date vs baseline completion date (schedule variance), budget spent vs budget total (cost variance), number of open issues or risks (if tracked), and upcoming milestones. Visual elements could include pie charts (e.g., tasks by status distribution), bar charts (planned vs actual timeline), and gauges (budget consumption). This gives a quick project health overview for the PM or an executive.
- **Progress Tracking:** The system should compute project progress, often measured as the percentage of total work completed. This could be a simple average of tasks completed or more sophisticated (weighted by task durations or effort). Earned value management (EVM) is a technique used in enterprise projects – while implementing full EVM might be complex, the tool should at least offer metrics like Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and Cost Performance Index (CPI) if possible, derived from baseline vs actual progress. At minimum, tracking of baseline vs actual finish dates for tasks allows calculation of schedule variance.
- **Task Status Monitoring:** Provide views or reports that specifically show which tasks are in progress, which are late, and which are coming up. For example, a report “Tasks due in next 7 days” or “Tasks that were due last week but not done” to help PMs catch slippages. These could be automated alerts as well (email or in-app notifications for overdue tasks to assignees and PMs).
- **Resource Utilization Reports:** As part of monitoring, include reports focusing on resource usage. E.g., a heat map or table showing each resource’s utilization % each week, or a chart of actual hours logged by each team member vs their capacity. If certain team members are over-utilized (over 100% allocation) or under-utilized (below, say, 50%), the PM can rebalance work. Another example: report showing total hours or cost per resource on the project to date (useful for seeing who is contributing the most or costing the most).
- **User Productivity Tracking:** While somewhat sensitive, the software can provide data on **user productivity**, like how many tasks each team member has completed in a period, or average time to complete tasks, etc. ([Best Project Management Software: User Reviews from May 2025](https://www.g2.com/categories/project-management#:~:text=Project%20management%20software%20streamlines%20project,efficiency%20at%20an%20organizational%20level)). This must be used carefully and more as a team management insight rather than a micro-management tool. For instance, a dashboard might list all team members and how many tasks assigned vs completed this month, or compare planned effort vs actual effort per person. The goal is to identify bottlenecks or training needs (if someone is struggling to complete tasks on time) and to recognize high performers or overburdened staff.
- **Custom Reports and Exports:** Enterprises often need custom reporting. The software should allow generating reports with chosen fields and filters. For example, a PM might want a report of all tasks with their status and responsible person to send out. The system should let users customize columns and criteria, and then either export to Excel/PDF or share within the tool. Some standard report templates should be provided (status report, budget report, etc., which can be run at any time).
- **Multi-Project Reporting:** If multiple projects are tracked, provide higher-level reports such as portfolio status (list of projects with each one’s % complete, status, PM name, etc.), or resource reports across projects (e.g., John Doe is allocated 50% on Project A and 30% on Project B). This ensures enterprise leadership can oversee all projects. If this is beyond initial scope, ensure the data model would eventually support querying across projects (with proper permissions).
- **Real-Time Data and Refresh:** The dashboards and reports should use real-time or near-real-time data from the system. If a team member updates a task status, the project’s percent complete on the dashboard should update immediately or on the next refresh. Ideally, provide an auto-refresh feature or at least a refresh button. There should be minimal manual intervention to get up-to-date info (unlike static reports that go stale).
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Monitoring is enhanced by proactive alerts. The system shall allow users to set up notifications for certain events: task overdue, task completed, milestone reached, budget threshold exceeded (e.g., 75% spent), resource over-allocated, etc. Notifications can be in-app and/or email. For example, “Alert: Project Alpha – Budget at 90% with 2 milestones remaining” or “Task X is 3 days late – assigned to Y.” These help managers catch issues early.
- **Trend Analysis:** (Advanced) Over time, collecting historical data allows showing trends. For example, a burn-down chart for tasks (how the remaining tasks count is reducing week by week), or cost expenditure over time line chart. Trend charts can be part of reports to illustrate trajectory (are we slowing down or speeding up in completing work?).
- **Data Drill-down:** Interactive dashboards should allow clicking a metric (say “5 tasks overdue”) to drill into the list of those tasks. This interactivity makes monitoring actionable.
- **Security of Data:** Ensure that reports only show data accessible to the viewer’s permissions. For instance, a team member might not see the budget section of a dashboard if they’re not allowed financial info. External partner views should only show high-level reports as configured.
- **Printing/Sharing:** The system should support exporting or printing key reports for meetings. Perhaps a one-click “Generate Status Report PDF” that compiles the latest metrics, a milestone chart, and a list of late tasks. This is useful for weekly status meetings or email updates to stakeholders who might not log into the system.
- **Non-Functional:** The reporting module should handle large data (project with thousands of tasks, or portfolio with dozens of projects) without timing out. Some heavy reports might be generated asynchronously (with a loading indicator). Also, ensure that visualizations are clear and use enterprise-friendly designs (consistent colors, company branding if possible on exports). Accuracy is critical – the calculations (especially for costs and progress) must be tested thoroughly. Users will rely on these for important decisions, so the numbers must be trustworthy.

## Non-Functional Requirements

Aside from the above functional capabilities, the product must meet various **non-functional criteria** to be suitable for enterprise usage. These include performance, scalability, security (expanded later), usability, reliability, and maintainability. Below is a breakdown of key non-functional requirements:

### Performance & Scalability

- **Concurrent Users:** The system shall support a large number of concurrent users (enterprise-scale teams). For example, it should handle at least **500 active users** on the system simultaneously (viewing or editing projects) without significant degradation. The architecture should be scalable (horizontally or vertically) to accommodate more users as needed (e.g., large enterprises with thousands of users should be supported by adding resources).
- **Response Time:** Common user actions (opening a project, updating a task, switching views) should occur quickly. As a guideline, most UI interactions should respond within **2 seconds** for data retrieval actions and under **0.5 second** for simple in-page interactions. Heavy operations like generating a complex report might take longer, but there should be feedback (progress indicators) and they should ideally complete within, say, 10-15 seconds for very large projects. Extremely long operations should be asynchronous to avoid blocking the user.
- **Data Volume:** The system must handle large projects (e.g., a project with **10,000 tasks, 1,000 milestones, 5,000 dependencies, and 500 resources**) gracefully. It should also handle a large number of projects in the database (e.g., 10,000 projects total, though not all open at once). Database queries and indexes should be optimized for these volumes. Archival strategies might be needed for old projects to keep performance high.
- **Scalable Architecture:** The SaaS should be designed such that increasing load can be managed by scaling out (adding server instances, using load balancers, etc.). Use of caching for frequently accessed data (like reference data or dashboards that many see) is encouraged to reduce repeated computation. If the app offers heavy computation (like schedule calculations), consider doing those on the client side for small projects or on the server in a background job for large ones to offload the interactive UI.
- **High Availability:** Enterprises will expect high uptime. The system should be deployable in a redundant configuration to achieve an **uptime of 99.9% or higher** (i.e., minimal downtime). This implies handling failovers, database replication, etc. While not a direct user feature, it’s a requirement that the service be reliably accessible. Scheduled maintenance should be infrequent and communicated.
- **Latency Considerations:** Since it’s SaaS, users from various geographies may use it. The system should employ CDNs or regional data centers as needed to ensure acceptable latency worldwide (page load times should be low even for distant users). Also, optimize data payloads (e.g., only load necessary data for a view, use pagination for very large lists, etc.).

### Reliability & Fault Tolerance

- **Data Integrity:** The system must protect against data loss or corruption. All operations on projects (especially bulk ones) should either complete fully or not at all (transactional behavior) – e.g., if a bulk update fails halfway due to an error, roll back to previous state to avoid partial updates.
- **Backup & Recovery:** Regular backups of the database and files should be supported so that in a worst-case scenario (catastrophic failure), data can be restored with minimal loss. For instance, daily snapshots and the ability to recover a project or the entire system to any snapshot. Possibly allow individual project restore if someone deletes something critical (maybe an admin feature to undelete or recover tasks).
- **Error Handling:** The application should handle exceptions gracefully. If a server error occurs, the user sees a friendly error message and possibly an automatic retry for transient issues. Logging should capture error details for developers to debug. Under no circumstances should an error crash the entire application for all users; isolate issues to specific user sessions or requests.
- **Consistency:** In collaborative usage, if multiple users edit the project simultaneously, the system should maintain a consistent state. Ideally, implement optimistic concurrency – e.g., if two users try to edit the same task, handle with last write wins or an edit conflict resolution mechanism. Real-time collaborative editing (like multiple people editing different tasks at once) would be a plus, but at minimum, prevent or warn on direct conflicts.
- **Session Management:** Ensure user sessions are managed (with timeouts for inactivity as a security measure, perhaps configurable). Session expiry should not unexpectedly drop data (auto-save any in-progress inputs periodically to prevent loss).
- **Availability Zones:** (If applicable) Deploy across multiple zones/regions to mitigate data center-specific outages. For enterprise customers, possibly offer a disaster recovery setup in a secondary region. These are more back-end requirements but important for enterprise trust.

### Maintainability & Extensibility

- **Modular Architecture:** The software should be built in a modular way (similar to how we’ve described modules in this PRD). This makes it easier for development teams to maintain and enhance each area. New features (say, adding risk management module) can be plugged in without overhauling the core.
- **API-Driven Design:** (Detailed in Integration section) By having a robust API, the front-end uses the same API as external integrators. This ensures that the business logic is centralized and any change needs to be done in one place (less duplication of logic).
- **Configuration and Customization:** The system should be maintainable in the sense that enterprise-specific customizations (like adding a custom field to tasks, or a custom workflow) can be done via configuration rather than code changes. Providing an admin UI for custom fields, or flexible settings, reduces the need for maintenance releases and forks for different customers.
- **Documentation & Code Quality:** The development should follow good coding practices with documentation, which in a PRD might not be directly visible but is a requirement for long-term maintainability. Clear documentation for the development team (and user-facing documentation for customers) should be produced.
- **Testing:** A comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, UI tests) is required to ensure that as new features are added, existing functionality remains stable (regression testing). Particularly, critical computations like scheduling and cost calculations should have automated tests for various scenarios to catch issues if modifications are made.
- **Upgrade Process:** For SaaS, upgrades are continuous, but if some customers are on a private instance, ensure the system can be upgraded with minimal downtime and without data migration issues. Use forward-compatible data schemas when possible to allow smooth transitions.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** The software should have logging of key events and application metrics. This helps maintainers identify issues (memory leaks, slow queries, etc.) early. For enterprise SaaS, likely there will be an ops team monitoring performance metrics and error rates; the software should expose these (like number of active users, queue lengths, etc.).

### Usability & Accessibility

_(Note: UI/UX is discussed in a later section, but here we cover it from a requirement standpoint.)_

- **Ease of Use:** The application should be intuitive for its various user roles. A new project manager user should be able to perform basic tasks (create project, add tasks, assign resources) with minimal training. The interface should use familiar paradigms (e.g., dragging tasks in a timeline, double-click to edit names, right-click context menus for advanced options) to leverage users’ existing knowledge of similar tools. A smooth user experience encourages adoption and reduces errors.
- **Consistency:** The UI elements and interactions should be consistent across modules. For example, editing a name field works the same way on a task, a resource, or a project. Consistent color coding (maybe each project has a color, or each task status has a specific color) helps cognitive recognition.
- **Accessibility:** The software shall conform to accessibility standards (like **WCAG 2.1 AA**). This means providing text alternatives for icons (so screen readers can describe them), ensuring sufficient color contrast, supporting keyboard navigation (e.g., a user should be able to navigate the task list or board using keyboard only), and handling assistive technologies properly. This is crucial for enterprise compliance and for users with disabilities.
- **Localization:** The product should be built with internationalization in mind so it can be localized to multiple languages. Even if initially launched in English, preparing for Unicode support, externalizable strings, and proper date/number format handling is a requirement. Enterprise companies may have global teams, so offering multiple language support might be expected (English, Spanish, French, etc.).
- **Onboarding & Help:** The system should provide onboarding guides or tooltips for new users (especially for complex features like creating dependencies or using agile boards if they are not familiar). In-app help (like a “?” icon explaining what a critical path is when that feature is viewed) can improve usability. Additionally, a searchable help documentation or knowledge base link should be accessible.
- **Error Prevention & Validation:** The UI should prevent common mistakes, e.g., confirm before deleting a project, validate that end date is not before start date, etc. When users input data that doesn’t make sense, show friendly error messages explaining the issue (rather than just “error”).
- **Responsive Design:** It is ideal if the web application is responsive to different screen sizes, allowing at least viewing (if not full editing) on tablets or mobile devices. Perhaps a dedicated mobile app could be considered, but at minimum the web UI should be accessible from a modern browser on various devices. For instance, a project manager might quickly check a dashboard on a tablet in a meeting. Some complex views (like Gantt) might be read-only or simplified on small screens.
- **UI Performance:** The client-side UI should load quickly (target under 5 seconds for initial load on a typical connection) and feel snappy. Use asynchronous loading of data and avoid blocking UI threads. Pagination or virtual scrolling should be used for very long lists to avoid a heavy DOM. Also consider using web workers for heavy computations in the browser if needed (like rendering a huge Gantt).
- **Customization (UI):** Users may appreciate some personalization, such as the ability to rearrange dashboard widgets, choose light/dark theme (especially since the example image shows a dark mode; supporting a dark mode is increasingly expected), or configure notifications frequency. These enhance user experience but must be balanced with development effort.

## User Roles and Permissions

The system will support multiple **user roles**, each with specific permissions appropriate to their responsibilities. Role-based access control ensures users only see and do what they are authorized for, which is crucial for enterprise security and effective collaboration ([Why Should I Use User, Role and Access Management (Permissions) in Project Management Software?](https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/why-should-i-use-user-role-and-access-management-permissions-in-project-management-software/#:~:text=User%2C%20role%2C%20and%20access%20management,and%20edit%20within%20the%20software)). Below we define key user roles and their permissions in the context of this project management software:

### Project Manager (PM)

**Description:** The Project Manager is typically the owner of one or more projects. They are responsible for planning and execution of projects, so they need full control over project data.

**Permissions & Capabilities:**

- Can create new projects and edit all aspects of projects they own (WBS, tasks, assignments, budgets, etc.).
- Can add/remove tasks, set dependencies, and adjust schedules for their projects.
- Can assign resources (team members) to tasks on their projects and adjust resource allocations.
- Can enter and edit budget and cost information for their projects. They can view financial data (budget, actuals) for their projects.
- Can monitor progress and run reports for their projects.
- Can manage project-specific settings (methodology, templates usage, custom fields for that project).
- Can invite or add team members to their project (provided those users exist in the system) and set their project-level roles (e.g., designate a team member or a co-project lead).
- Can mark tasks complete or update statuses (as can team members on their own tasks, see below). A PM can update any task in their project.
- Can baseline the project schedule or budget, and manage changes (like re-baselining).
- Can view and comment on all updates in the project (including those by team members).
- Typically cannot see projects they are not a part of (unless also in another role like Portfolio Manager). They might, however, have “read” access to other projects in their department if sharing is configured.

### Team Member (Project Contributor)

**Description:** Team members are the individuals doing the project work. They need to see their tasks and update their progress, but they usually have limited control over planning aspects.

**Permissions & Capabilities:**

- Can view the projects and tasks to which they are assigned (or otherwise given access). By default, a team member sees the task list, board, or calendar for the project and the tasks they need to work on.
- Can update the status of tasks assigned to them (e.g., start work, mark complete, add comments on progress). They might also update fields like % complete or remaining hours on their tasks if using timesheets.
- Can log work hours or expenses on their tasks if the system supports time tracking/cost input from individuals.
- Can see other tasks in the project at least in a read-only fashion (often team members have visibility into the whole project plan to understand context, unless restricted). However, they cannot typically edit tasks not assigned to them.
- Cannot change project structure (cannot add/delete tasks in general, unless perhaps the PM delegates certain planning tasks to them on a case-by-case basis).
- Cannot assign/reassign resources (they can’t assign others to tasks or change assignments, aside from maybe delegating their own task to someone else if allowed).
- Cannot adjust overall schedules or dependencies (they might request changes if needed via comments or change requests to PM).
- Can view the project’s progress and maybe some reports as read-only (like they might see how overall percent complete is, or a dashboard that the PM shares). But typically, they do not see budget info unless allowed (sensitive).
- Typically cannot create new projects. They work within projects that a PM or admin has created and added them to.
- May have access to team collaboration features like commenting on any task (to discuss issues) or attaching files.
- **Note:** A Team Member could have a more restricted sub-role, e.g., “External Collaborator” which is similar but only sees a subset of info (like a contractor might only see tasks assigned to them, not full plan). This can be configured with permissions, but for simplicity, team member covers internal contributors.

### Resource Manager

**Description:** (Optional role, but common in enterprise PMOs) A Resource Manager oversees resource utilization across projects, often managing a pool of people (e.g., department head allocating staff to projects). They might not create project plans themselves but they coordinate who is allocated where.

**Permissions & Capabilities:**

- Can view resource allocation and availability across all projects (or all projects within their domain/department). They might have access to a **Resource Management dashboard** that spans projects.
- Can adjust resource assignments in coordination with PMs. Possibly they have permission to directly assign or unassign resources to tasks, even on projects they are not the PM for – if the organization allows that. (Often a negotiation: PM requests a resource, Resource Manager approves and assigns a specific person.) The system could implement this via a workflow, but at minimum, Resource Manager can see all unstaffed assignments or requests and fill them.
- Can modify resource details like availability calendars, skills, and add new resources into the pool (though adding new user accounts may be an Admin function; resource manager can at least manage resource profiles).
- Cannot usually edit task details beyond resource fields. They wouldn’t change task names or dependencies; their focus is who is assigned.
- Can run utilization reports for their resources, even if those resources work on multiple projects under different PMs. They see data at resource level (which projects/tasks that resource is on).
- May not see the full financials of projects (unless also given permission), but they might see costing rates for resources to do cost allocation. Depends on the org’s segregation.
- They might not use this software if the organization doesn’t separate PM and resource manager roles. But for completeness, the capability is there.
- Can not create projects (unless also acting as PM).
- In terms of permissions hierarchy, a Resource Manager could be considered like a specialized admin for resource data.

### Executive Stakeholder / Viewer

**Description:** An executive or senior stakeholder who needs read-only access to project information for oversight. This could include C-suite, PMO directors, clients (internal), etc. They typically just want to see status and reports, not edit.

**Permissions & Capabilities:**

- Can view selected projects (likely not all, but those under their purview or that they have interest in). The system might allow marking certain users as observers on a project.
- Can access the project’s dashboard and reports, including high-level timeline and progress data. They might use a **portfolio view** if overseeing many projects, to see at a glance each project’s status.
- Cannot edit project tasks or assignments. Their access is read-only. They might be able to comment or ask questions on tasks or deliverables (if the system has a commenting feature and that’s allowed for observers).
- Can view budget and financial info if given that access (e.g., a sponsor likely can see budget usage). Possibly the PM would want to hide some internal details from certain stakeholders (especially if it’s an external client vs an internal exec). The permission system should allow granular control, but by default an internal executive can see everything except actually changing it.
- Can receive notifications or reports on a schedule (e.g., get a weekly email summary of project status).
- This role basically ensures higher-ups can keep track of projects without accidentally changing anything.
- In some cases, an executive might formally approve things (like stage-gate approvals). The system could allow them to mark an approval on a milestone, but that’s more of a workflow. At minimum, they can be listed as an approver and PM records it manually.

### External Client/Partner (Limited External User)

**Description:** This is an external user role for customers or partners who are given access via the **customer/partner view**. They have very limited visibility and can only see what the project team shares with them.

**Permissions & Capabilities:**

- Can log in (or via a special link) to view the **Partner view** of a specific project. They will typically only see high-level milestones, deliverables, and overall progress. Detailed tasks likely hidden unless flagged for sharing.
- Read-only access. They cannot edit tasks or the plan. They might not even see individual tasks, just phases or milestone completion percentages.
- Possibly can create or view issues or requests if there’s a mechanism for them to give feedback (for example, a client logs an issue or change request, which the PM then adds to the plan). If the system includes a basic issue tracking or change request log for external comms, the client could create those entries. If not, at least they can comment or send messages through the system to the PM.
- Cannot see internal comments or team discussions. Only sees comments marked for external. Ideally the system allows marking certain comments or attachments as “internal” vs “shared,” to avoid revealing internal notes.
- Cannot see budget details (they might see high-level like “on budget” or “20% budget overrun” if the team shares that, but not the actual cost breakdown unless deliberately shared).
- Only has access to the specific project(s) they are invited to. They cannot browse other projects or data.
- This user likely doesn’t count fully towards internal license counts in some SaaS models (often external collaborator access is free but limited). But from a requirements side, the main point is the restricted permission set.
- The UI for them is simplified: perhaps just a summary page and maybe a timeline view filtered for them.

### System Administrator

**Description:** The Admin manages the overall SaaS instance for the organization. They handle user accounts, global settings, and has highest privileges.

**Permissions & Capabilities:**

- Can create/edit/delete **all projects** (may not actively manage each project, but they have the rights to do so if needed, e.g., to reassign ownership if a PM leaves).
- Can manage all **users and roles**: invite new users, deactivate users, assign roles to users (e.g., make someone a Project Manager or Resource Manager for certain scope). They can reset passwords or configure SSO, etc.
- Can configure system-wide settings: for example, define custom fields available on projects or tasks, adjust default working hours calendar for the organization, set up authentication (like SAML SSO integration settings), and manage the template library (likely an admin or PMO function to maintain templates).
- Can manage **permissions schemes** if the system allows customized permission models (for instance, create a role that only can comment, etc.).
- Can access all data, including all financial information across projects, for audit purposes.
- Can run administrative reports, like user activity logs, license usage, etc. They might see an audit log of changes (who changed what and when, especially important for compliance).
- Responsible for data exports or backups (if organization needs to export all project data, admin can do so).
- Can manage integrations and API keys (e.g., generate API tokens, configure webhooks, connect the tool with Slack or other apps globally).
- Essentially, the Admin is the superuser. In some cases, there may be different levels (e.g., Org Admin vs Project Admin, but here we consider one top-level admin for simplicity).
- The admin would not be the one doing project planning usually (unless they double as a PM), but they ensure the system is configured and running well for others.

**Permission Matrix (Summary):** The following table summarizes which roles can perform key actions:

| **Action/Access**                         | **Admin** | **Project Manager**  |   **Team Member**    |           **Resource Manager**            | **Executive/Viewer**  | **External Client**  |

_(The table above provides an overview; fine-grained permissions can be configured in the actual system. Flexible permission schemes allow, for example, giving a team member edit rights on certain tasks or letting a client upload files to a shared folder, etc., as needed.)_

## Use Case Scenarios and User Stories

In this section, we outline several **use case scenarios** that illustrate how different users interact with the system to achieve their goals. Each scenario is accompanied by user stories or step-by-step narratives. These help to contextualize the requirements above with real-world usage examples.

### Scenario 1: Project Initiation and Planning

**Description:** A Project Manager starts a new project using a template, defines the WBS, and prepares the initial schedule and resource plan.

- **User Story 1 (Create Project from Template):** _As a Project Manager, I want to quickly initialize a new project using an existing template so that I can avoid starting from scratch and ensure best-practice structure._  
  **Steps:** The PM clicks “New Project”, selects the “IT Implementation” template. The system creates a new project pre-filled with phases like Initiation, Planning, Execution, Closure, each containing sample tasks. The PM then updates the project’s metadata (name, start date, etc.). All template tasks are now in the project’s WBS.

- **User Story 2 (Define WBS Structure):** _As a Project Manager, I want to break down project scope into a detailed WBS so that I can identify all tasks and deliverables required._  
  **Steps:** The PM reviews the template-provided tasks, edits some names, deletes a few that aren’t needed, and adds new tasks unique to this project. They organize tasks under appropriate phases, creating sub-tasks for larger work items. For example, under “Planning” phase, they add tasks “Requirements Gathering” and “Design”, and then add subtasks under “Design” for “UI Design” and “Database Design”. The interface allows indenting tasks to create this hierarchy. The PM marks key milestones such as “Project Kickoff Complete” and “Go-Live” as milestone type tasks with zero duration. The WBS now reflects the full scope.

- **User Story 3 (Assign Initial Dates and Dependencies):** _As a Project Manager, I want to sequence tasks with dependencies and set an initial timeline so that the project has a realistic schedule._  
  **Steps:** Using the Gantt view, the PM drags task bars to roughly line up with the calendar (or enters durations manually). They then link tasks: e.g., Finish-to-Start link from “Requirements Gathering” to “Design” tasks (Design can only start after requirements are done). They set “Design” to have two parallel subtasks (UI and Database) both starting after requirements. They link both those subtasks to a “Design Complete” milestone (milestone occurs when both are finished). The system calculates dates forward: if Requirements ends on March 10, the Design tasks start March 11, etc. The PM adjusts a few with leads and lags (maybe overlap testing one week before development fully done by a Start-to-Start with lag). The critical path is highlighted: the PM notices that “Procure Hardware” task is on the critical path extending into deployment. They adjust duration or add resources accordingly.

- **User Story 4 (Allocate Resources to Tasks):** _As a Project Manager, I want to assign team members to each task so that responsibilities are clear and resource needs are accounted for._  
  **Steps:** The PM opens the resource panel. They add team members Alice, Bob, and Carol (already in the resource pool) to the project team. Then, for each major task, they assign an owner: Alice for requirements, Bob and Carol for design subtasks (Bob on UI Design, Carol on DB Design), etc. The system checks availability: if Bob was already allocated to another project at 50%, it might warn if this new assignment pushes him over 100%. The PM sees a warning for Bob in July where two projects overlap. The PM decides to shorten Bob’s task duration or negotiate adjusting schedules. All tasks now have assignees, populating the RACI chart for the project.

- **Outcome:** The project now has a baseline plan: WBS, schedule, dependencies, and resource assignments. The PM saves a baseline snapshot of the schedule and budget (if initial budget entered). The project is ready to kick off, and the PM can communicate the plan to the team and stakeholders via a generated summary (perhaps exporting a PDF schedule or granting view access to executives).

### Scenario 2: Agile Sprint Execution within a Project

**Description:** An Agile team uses the tool to run sprints within the project. This scenario shows how a project configured for Agile is managed by the team during execution.

- **User Story 1 (Backlog Grooming):** _As a Product Owner (role similar to PM in Agile context), I want to maintain a backlog of user stories so that the team has a prioritized list of work items to implement._  
  **Steps:** The Product Owner enters several user stories into the project’s backlog section: e.g., “As a customer, I can register an account” (with description and acceptance criteria), “As an admin, I can generate a report”, etc. They assign story points to each (e.g., 3, 5, 2 points) and rank them by priority (dragging them in order). The backlog is now populated.

- **User Story 2 (Sprint Planning):** _As a Scrum Master, I want to plan a sprint by selecting backlog items and assigning them to the sprint so that the team knows what to work on for this iteration._  
  **Steps:** The Scrum Master creates “Sprint 1” in the tool, setting a 2-week duration (March 1–March 14). They then drag the top 5 user stories from the backlog into Sprint 1. The system automatically creates corresponding tasks (or uses the user stories as tasks) in the sprint backlog. The Scrum Master reviews capacity: Alice and Bob are on the team, each has ~10 points capacity; the total points in Sprint 1 is 12 which is acceptable. They click “Start Sprint”. The sprint’s start and end dates are now active.

- **User Story 3 (Kanban Daily Use):** _As a Team Member (Developer), I want to update my progress on tasks using a Kanban board so that everyone can see what’s in progress and what’s done._  
  **Steps:** During the sprint, the team uses the board view. Alice picks the story “User account registration” and moves its card from “To Do” to “In Progress” when she starts working. She adds a subtask for herself “Implement backend” and one for Bob “Implement frontend”, if needed, directly on the card. Bob sees his tasks on his dashboard. Each day, Alice may update the card with a comment (“Encountered a slight delay due to validation rules, might extend 1 day”) and log time if required. Once done, she moves the card to “In Review”. The tester then tests it and moves to “Done”. Meanwhile, the burn-down chart for Sprint 1 updates showing steady completion of story points.

- **User Story 4 (Sprint Review and Retrospective):** _As a Scrum Master, I want to close the sprint and review completed vs pending work so that we can plan the next sprint effectively._  
  **Steps:** At the end of Sprint 1, the Scrum Master ends the sprint in the tool. The system shows that 4 out of 5 stories were completed, one story is still in progress. The Scrum Master accepts the prompt to move the unfinished story back to the backlog (or into Sprint 2 automatically). Reports for Sprint 1 are available: e.g., a chart of committed vs completed work, and each team member’s contributions. For retrospective, the team might note that scope was a bit high.

- **Outcome:** The project management tool supported the Agile process: backlog, sprint planning, daily Kanban updates, and sprint closure. The project’s overall progress is also updated: tasks completed in sprint feed into overall percent complete. The PM (Product Owner) can also see how these sprints align with any higher-level timeline (if a hybrid approach, maybe a release milestone at end of 2 sprints). Agile and waterfall elements coexisted as needed.

### Scenario 3: Cross-Team Resource Allocation and Adjustment

**Description:** A Resource Manager and a Project Manager interact to adjust resource allocations when a conflict arises between two projects.

- **User Story 1 (Resource Overload Identification):** _As a Resource Manager, I want to be notified if a resource is over-allocated across projects so that I can take action to resolve the conflict._  
  **Steps:** The Resource Manager opens a **Resource Utilization** report for all developers in Q2. The report shows that **Bob** is allocated 120% in April (60% on Project Alpha and 60% on Project Beta, which overlaps). The system has also flagged this in an alert: “Resource Overutilization: Bob at 120% in Apr 2025”. The Resource Manager gets this alert and drills down to see the tasks causing it. On Project Alpha (managed by PM Alice), Bob is assigned to “UI Design” due April 15. On Project Beta (PM Charlie), Bob is assigned to “Module X Development” April 10–30. There’s an overlap.

- **User Story 2 (Resource Manager Adjusts Allocation):** _As a Resource Manager, I want to adjust project assignments or schedules to resolve overallocation, coordinating with project managers if needed._  
  **Steps:** The Resource Manager decides to address the conflict. They consult with both PMs. Suppose Project Beta has some flexibility, while Project Alpha is on a strict timeline. The Resource Manager uses the tool’s **resource leveling** suggestion: it might suggest delaying Bob’s start on Module X by 2 weeks (if slack allows) or assigning an alternate resource for part of Module X. The Resource Manager sees that another developer, Carol, is only 50% utilized in April. They decide to allocate Carol to assist on “Module X Development”. In the tool, as Resource Manager, they modify Project Beta’s task assignment: add Carol as a secondary resource on Module X and reduce Bob’s allocation to 30% on that task (Carol 30%). Alternatively, they push the task’s start date for Bob. The system recalculates Project Beta’s schedule slightly (if Carol is free to pick up earlier parts, maybe no delay; if waiting for Bob’s part, maybe a slight extension). Project Alpha remains unchanged. Now Bob’s overall load is down to ~90%. The tool’s utilization chart updates, clearing the red highlight for Bob. The Resource Manager documents in a comment that Carol will help on Module X.

- **User Story 3 (Project Manager Notified of Resource Change):** _As a Project Manager (of Project Beta), I want to be aware when the resource assignment on my project changes so that I can adjust any plans or onboard the new resource._  
  **Steps:** When the Resource Manager made the change, PM Charlie (Project Beta) receives a notification: “Resource Manager has adjusted resources on Task ‘Module X Development’: Carol added, Bob allocation reduced.” Charlie opens Project Beta plan and sees the updated assignment and any schedule change. He might adjust a predecessor to ensure Carol has necessary info earlier. The PM might also update the task description to reflect Carol’s involvement or schedule a quick meeting for knowledge transfer. The tool ensures all users have the latest info: Bob sees on his “My Work” that Module X task is now only partially his, and Carol sees Module X appear on her task list.

- **Outcome:** The potential schedule conflict was resolved through cross-project visibility of resource allocation. The system facilitated coordination: detection via reports/alerts, execution via updating assignments, and communication via notifications. Both projects continue smoothly with realistic workloads.

### Scenario 4: Budget Monitoring and Correction

**Description:** Mid-project, the PM finds that actual costs are exceeding the budget. They use the system to identify the cause and adjust the plan.

- **User Story 1 (Track Budget vs Actual):** _As a Project Manager, I want to monitor how actual expenses compare to the budget so that I can control costs and avoid overruns._  
  **Steps:** Midway through the project, the PM checks the **Budget Report**. It shows: Budget = $500,000, Actual Cost to date = $300,000, Planned (earned value) to date = $250,000. This indicates a $50,000 cost overrun for the work accomplished (CPI < 1). The PM looks at breakdown and sees the **Testing phase** is already at $80,000 actual vs $50,000 budget (over because extra testing hours were needed). The system highlights negative variance in red ([Tracking Budget Variance in Project Management](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/budget-variance#:~:text=Budget%20variance%20is%20one%20of,it%20eats%20into%20the%20general)) ([Tracking Budget Variance in Project Management](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/budget-variance#:~:text=match%20at%20L240%20,further%20investigation%20to%20learn%20why)).

- **User Story 2 (Identify Cost Drivers):** _As a Project Manager, I want to identify which tasks or resources are causing the budget overrun so that I can take targeted corrective actions._  
  **Steps:** The PM drills down in the cost report or filters by phase = Testing. It lists each task in Testing with budget vs actual: e.g., “Test Case Development” budget $20k, actual $30k (overspent $10k), “Test Execution” budget $30k, actual $45k (overspent $15k so far). They then look at resource cost report: it shows tester Alice has logged more hours than planned, likely due to underestimated complexity. The PM realizes the testing effort was underestimated.

- **User Story 3 (Adjust Plan or Scope):** _As a Project Manager, I want to adjust the project plan (or get approvals) to address the budget overrun, either by re-allocating funds, cutting scope, or improving efficiency._  
  **Steps:** The PM decides to respond in two ways: 1) request additional budget for testing from the sponsor, and 2) optimize remaining work to save cost. They use the tool to forecast final cost: currently $300k actual with maybe 40% of work done, trending to $750k if no changes. They create a scenario where they drop a low-priority feature (which saves development and testing effort). In the plan, they mark tasks related to that feature as removed or push them beyond project scope. The system shows this could save ~$50k. They also see if any cheaper resource can do some testing tasks (maybe a junior tester at lower rate for easier cases). They adjust the assignment on “Test Execution” tasks to mix in the junior resource. Now, they update the budget: perhaps adding $50k to Testing phase (with sponsor approval offline). They then re-baseline the budget (or note a variance approval).

- **User Story 4 (Communicate and Monitor Going Forward):** _As a Project Manager, I want to communicate the cost adjustments to stakeholders and continue monitoring to ensure the project stays within the new budget._  
  **Steps:** The PM generates a report from the tool – a budget status report showing original vs revised budget, where overruns happened and what changes are made. They attach this to a status update for the sponsor. In the project dashboard, the PM sets an alert for if any phase goes 10% over budget going forward. The team is instructed to be mindful of hours. Over the next weeks, the PM frequently checks the dashboard’s cost performance index (which now improves if their adjustments work). The tool’s real-time nature means any further deviation will be quickly visible (e.g., if testing still logs too many hours that week, the PM sees the actual costs rising and can intervene immediately).

- **Outcome:** The software’s budgeting and reporting features enabled the PM to catch a cost overrun early, diagnose it (testing phase underestimated), and adjust the plan and budget. This helps avoid unpleasant surprises at project end. The ability to scenario plan (though manual in this case via adjustments) and track changes ensures better financial control.

### Scenario 5: Executive Oversight and Partner Updates

**Description:** An executive stakeholder and an external client use the system to get updates on the project without needing detailed involvement.

- **User Story 1 (Executive Portfolio View):** _As a PMO Director (Executive), I want to see a high-level summary of all current projects so that I can understand status and risk without digging into details._  
  **Steps:** The PMO Director opens the **Portfolio Dashboard**. It lists Project Alpha, Project Beta, etc., each with a status indicator (Green/Yellow/Red), % complete, budget status, and upcoming milestone. For Project Alpha, it shows “Yellow – 60% complete, due 06/30/2025, budget 65% used.” The director clicks it to see more: maybe a one-page project status (milestones achieved, key risks flagged by PM, etc.). They see that testing phase was an issue but corrective actions taken (the PM updated a status note in the tool which is visible here). Satisfied, the director might only follow up with the PM via a short comment: “Keep an eye on remaining testing – escalate if any further slips.” They leave that comment on the project, which the PM sees and responds to.

- **User Story 2 (Client Checking Status via Partner View):** _As an External Client, I want to view the project’s progress and next steps in a simplified view so that I stay informed about delivery timelines._  
  **Steps:** The client logs into the partner portal link for Project Alpha. They see a simplified dashboard: Project Alpha – Overall 60% complete. A timeline shows major milestones: “Requirements – done on Mar 1; Design – done on Apr 1; Development – done on May 15; Testing – in progress, expected Jun 15; Go-Live – expected Jun 30.” They also see a list of deliverables: e.g., “User Manual Draft – Pending, due Jun 20” and overall status: “On Schedule (with some budget risk, being managed).” They do not see individual task lists or internal discussions. The client has a question on a milestone – they type a comment or question: “Is the user training session date confirmed?” The system routes this comment to the PM, who then responds via the system: “Scheduled for Jul 5, invite to follow.” The client gets an email notification of the response. The partner view might also show any documents shared with client (like a requirements sign-off document, training plan, etc., which the PM marked as shared). The client downloads the latest status report PDF from last week that the PM attached for them.

- **User Story 3 (Secure External Sharing):** _As a Project Manager, I want to share specific information with the client without giving access to internal details so that trust is built while maintaining confidentiality._  
  **Steps:** Earlier, the PM configured the partner view settings: they chose which milestones and deliverables are visible to the client (some internal milestones like “Internal QA complete” might be hidden, while “UAT Complete” is shown). They marked certain documents as client-visible. When the client asked a question, the PM decided to create a FAQ page (or simply keep answering in comments). All communication is logged. The PM occasionally posts a summary in the update feed marked “external”, so the client can read an update message like “Week 10: Development completed, starting testing, a slight delay in module X but mitigation in place, on track for June 30.” This is how the PM keeps the client in the loop proactively.

- **Outcome:** The executive stakeholders get the insight they need without micromanaging, thanks to high-level portfolio and project status views. The client remains informed and confident in the project through the partner-facing features, reducing the need for separate status meetings or emails. The system thereby enhances transparency and alignment.

### Scenario 6: Integration and Automation

**Description:** The project management software integrates with other tools to streamline work – for example, synchronizing with a calendar and posting updates to a team chat.

- **User Story 1 (Calendar Integration for Milestones):** _As a Team Member, I want important project dates to appear on my Outlook/Google Calendar so that I don’t miss key deadlines._  
  **Steps:** The system is configured (by Admin or user) to sync milestones and task deadlines with the corporate calendar system. For instance, a milestone “Go-Live on June 30” generates a calendar event on June 30 for all project stakeholders. Each team member also enabled “My Task Deadlines” sync: so if Alice has a task due May 5, she sees an event on May 5 in her calendar “Project Alpha – Task X due”. The integration uses an API or ICS feed. Alice checks her Outlook and sees these entries; if a date changes in the PM tool, the calendar event updates (maybe via a daily sync or webhook push). This helps her manage time.

- **User Story 2 (SSO Integration):** _As an IT Admin, I want users to log into the project management tool using our corporate Single Sign-On so that access is secure and easy._  
  **Steps:** The Admin configures SAML SSO using the company’s identity provider (e.g., Azure AD). Now users can click “Login with SSO”, use their company credentials, and get into the PM software without separate passwords. This also means when someone leaves the company and their AD account is disabled, they can no longer access the PM tool, which is secure. (This is behind the scenes, but important integration.)

- **User Story 3 (Team Chat Integration):** _As a Project Manager, I want key project updates to be posted to our team Slack/Microsoft Teams channel so that the team is instantly aware of important changes._  
  **Steps:** The PM sets up an integration such that when a milestone is achieved or a project status is changed to Red, a message is sent to a specific Slack channel #project-alpha. One day, a developer completes the “Beta Release” milestone and marks it done in the tool. Immediately, the tool via webhook posts to Slack: “Project Alpha: Milestone ‘Beta Release’ completed by Alice 🎉”. Team members see this in Slack and react with thumbs up. Another integration triggers if a task is marked delayed: it posts “⚠️ Task ‘XYZ’ is overdue as of today.” This prompts the team in chat to discuss and resolve it quickly.

- **User Story 4 (API Usage for Custom Report):** _As a Data Analyst, I want to pull project data via API into our BI tool so that I can create a custom executive dashboard combining multiple data sources._  
  **Steps:** The analyst uses an API key with read permissions that the admin created. They call the PM software’s API endpoint for projects, tasks, etc. They retrieve JSON data of all projects’ status, and maybe cross-reference with sales data in a BI tool (like Power BI or Tableau). They produce a dashboard that shows project progress alongside business KPIs. Since the API is available, this can be automated to refresh weekly. The PM software’s API ensures any data accessible to the analyst (maybe just high-level, given their role) can be extracted.

- **Outcome:** Integrations make the tool a seamless part of the enterprise ecosystem. Users benefit from reduced duplicate work (no need to manually put dates in calendar), improved communication (updates in chat), and centralized auth (SSO). The open API allows extending capabilities beyond what’s built-in, showing the product’s flexibility.

These scenarios and user stories demonstrate how the system’s requirements come together in practice, guiding development to ensure each role’s needs are met and each feature provides value in context.

## Integration and API Support

Enterprise software must coexist with a variety of other systems. This project management tool will provide robust **integration capabilities** to connect with the existing tool stack and facilitate data flow ([10 Best Enterprise Project Management Software [2025]](https://www.smartsuite.com/blog/enterprise-project-management-software?105755a5_page=2#:~:text=Integration%20capabilities)). Integrations help avoid duplicate data entry and enable automation across platforms. Key integration considerations and API features include:

- **Open REST API:** The software will offer a comprehensive RESTful API covering all major entities – projects, tasks, resources, assignments, statuses, etc. External applications can use the API to **create, read, update, and delete** (CRUD) project data. For example, an external script could create a new task in the project or retrieve the list of tasks and their status for reporting. The API should be secure (using API keys or OAuth for authorization) and well-documented. Common use cases: integrating with a corporate dashboard, automated bulk loading of projects from another system, or extracting data for analytics.

- **Webhooks:** The system will support webhooks to notify other applications of certain events. A user or admin can configure webhooks for events like “task status changed”, “milestone reached”, or “project created”. When these events occur, the system will send an HTTP POST with event data to a specified URL. This allows real-time integration; e.g., a webhook to a CI/CD pipeline could trigger automated tests when a “Ready for Testing” task status is set, or as mentioned, a webhook to a chat app for notifications.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Integration with enterprise identity providers (like Azure Active Directory, Okta, Google Workspace) via SAML 2.0 or OAuth/OIDC. This allows single sign-on such that users use their corporate credentials to access the app. It simplifies user management and improves security. Admins can map SSO groups to roles in the app (for instance, members of an AD group “Project Managers” get PM role automatically). The product documentation will detail how to set up SSO and any SCIM support for user provisioning if needed.

- **Calendar Integration:** The tool will integrate with calendar systems (e.g., Outlook/Exchange, Google Calendar). Through either publishing an iCal feed or using APIs (like Microsoft Graph API for Office 365), the system can push key dates (tasks due, milestones) to users’ calendars. Conversely, it could also allow subscribing to a calendar feed for a project timeline. This integration ensures deadlines are visible in tools users already use daily.

- **Email Integration:** The product will send email notifications for important updates (if user opts in) – e.g., “Task A assigned to you” or daily summary of due tasks. For deeper integration, it could allow replying to an email to post a comment (e.g., a notification email that a comment was made might let the user reply via email and that reply gets added as a comment). This requires parsing inbound emails and is an advanced feature, possibly a future consideration. At minimum, robust outbound email notifications are supported.

- **ChatOps Integration:** As scenario indicated, integration with team collaboration tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams. The software can have built-in connectors (for example, a Slack app or Teams webhook) to post messages to channels based on triggers. Additionally, possibly support slash commands or bots – e.g., in Slack, a user could type “/project status Alpha” and the bot returns a summary. Such integrations improve engagement. Initially, focus on outgoing notifications via webhooks to these platforms.

- **File Storage Integration:** Projects often involve documents. The software should integrate with enterprise document management or cloud storage (SharePoint, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box, etc.). For example, a user attaches a file to a task; integration could allow selecting a file from SharePoint or linking to it rather than uploading separately. Or at least, provide an API to link to external document repositories. Many PM tools allow linking Google Docs or OneDrive files to tasks. Similarly, final deliverables could be stored in a document system but referenced in the project tool. This prevents duplication and respects corporate document control.

- **DevOps/Issue Tracker Integration:** In tech projects, integration with tools like Jira, GitHub, GitLab, or Azure DevOps might be desired. For example, if development tasks are tracked in Jira, the PM software could import those as tasks or at least reflect their status. Full synchronization is complex, but perhaps an integration for mapping tasks to Jira issues or linking between them. This way developers can work in Jira, while the PM’s high-level plan in our tool stays updated (maybe via periodic sync or manual triggers). This is optional and perhaps a later feature, but the architecture should allow such connectors.

- **CRM/ERP Integration:** For consulting projects or client projects, integration with CRM (like Salesforce) could push project info to Salesforce or vice versa (e.g., when a sale closes, automatically create a project in our tool). Or ERP systems might provide actual cost data (like pulling actuals from SAP financials). These are advanced enterprise integrations typically done on a case-by-case basis using the API. The product should make such use cases possible with API endpoints and maybe offer a few connectors if common.

- **Zapier / Integration Platforms:** To facilitate easy integration for non-technical users, the software should be listed on or compatible with integration platforms like Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, or IFTTT. This means providing connectors or at least making the API easy for those platforms to use. For example, a Zapier integration might allow a user to set up “When a new task is created in [tool], create a card in Trello” or “When a task is marked done, create a record in Google Sheets”. This greatly expands integration possibilities without custom coding.

- **Data Import/Export:** While not an integration with a live system, the ability to import data from other PM tools (MS Project, Excel, CSV, maybe Jira) is important for onboarding. For instance, the system should allow importing an MS Project file and converting it into a project plan in the tool (mapping fields like tasks, durations, dependencies). Similarly, bulk import of tasks via CSV for those who prepare offline. Export to formats like CSV, PDF reports, or MS Project format also falls here, enabling integration into reporting processes or backup.

- **Integration Security & Compliance:** All integrations must comply with security. API access should require proper auth (API keys tied to specific permissions). Rate limiting on API to prevent abuse. Webhooks should use secret tokens to verify authenticity. Data flowing to external apps should be encrypted in transit and sanitized if needed to prevent injection. The system will provide logging for API calls (for audit) and allow admin to revoke keys or disable integrations that are not needed.

In summary, the platform is built to **connect easily with other tools**, either through direct built-in connectors or through a flexible API. “The platform you pick should integrate with your existing tool stack or offer pre-built APIs to facilitate data transfer” ([10 Best Enterprise Project Management Software [2025]](https://www.smartsuite.com/blog/enterprise-project-management-software?105755a5_page=2#:~:text=Integration%20capabilities)) – our solution does both. It provides pre-built integrations for common scenarios (calendars, SSO, notifications) and an open API for custom needs. This ensures the project management software becomes a central source of truth that can share information across the enterprise ecosystem, rather than a silo.

## Security, Compliance, and Data Privacy

Given the enterprise target audience, robust **security and compliance** features are paramount. The system will implement multiple layers of security to protect project data and ensure privacy, while also meeting industry compliance standards and regulations. Below are key guidelines and requirements in this domain:

- **Data Encryption:** All data shall be encrypted **in transit** and **at rest**. For transit, the application will enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2+). For data at rest, sensitive data in databases (like project details, user info) will be encrypted using strong encryption (AES-256 or similar). Attachments or documents stored should also be encrypted on the server. This prevents unauthorized reading of data even if infrastructure is compromised.

- **Authentication & Access Control:** Besides supporting SSO as mentioned, the system will have strong authentication controls. If not using SSO, it will enforce strong password policies (min length, complexity) and support **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for an extra security layer ([10 Best Enterprise Project Management Software [2025]](https://www.smartsuite.com/blog/enterprise-project-management-software?105755a5_page=2#:~:text=Evaluate%20the%20security%20measures%20offered,especially%20during%20migration%2C%20if%20required)). Role-based access (as detailed in User Roles) ensures users only access what they should. Possibly implement **access control lists** at a more granular level if needed (e.g., restrict certain projects to a subset of users). Administrative functions are limited to admin accounts.

- **Authorization & Session Security:** After login, user sessions will be managed securely with timeouts and protection against session hijacking. Perhaps implement device or IP whitelisting if required by an enterprise (some might want only corporate IP ranges to access). The principle of least privilege will be applied – e.g., even within the system, if a PM is not in a project, they cannot see it by default unless granted.

- **Audit Logging:** The software will maintain an **audit log** of important actions: logins (success/failure), data exports, project creation/deletion, critical changes (like changing a task’s due date past a milestone, or adjusting budget). Admins should be able to view these logs to trace who did what and when – useful for both security and general governance. For example, if someone deletes a bunch of tasks, the log shows which user and if they had permission. Possibly provide an undo mechanism or recycle bin for deleted items as part of data protection.

- **Compliance Standards:** The platform will aim to comply with major **security and privacy standards**. For instance, to satisfy enterprise procurement, the vendor should have SOC 2 Type II certification, and possibly ISO 27001 for information security management ([10 Best Enterprise Project Management Software [2025]](https://www.smartsuite.com/blog/enterprise-project-management-software?105755a5_page=2#:~:text=Evaluate%20the%20security%20measures%20offered,especially%20during%20migration%2C%20if%20required)). From a design perspective, the software should be built in a way that these certifications can be achieved (meaning strong internal controls, regular security testing, etc., though that’s organizational). If the product is multi-tenant SaaS, ensure proper data isolation between tenants so one client’s data can never be seen by another.

- **GDPR and Data Privacy:** For personal data stored (user profiles, comments that might include names, etc.), compliance with privacy regulations like **GDPR** (in Europe) is required ([The Impact of GDPR on Project Management - Omnitas Consulting](https://www.omnitas.com/the-impact-of-gdpr-on-project-management/#:~:text=The%20Impact%20of%20GDPR%20on,and%20robust%20data%20security%20practices)). This includes: providing a clear privacy policy, allowing data exports or deletion for an individual upon request, and obtaining any necessary consents (though as enterprise software, employees using it is likely covered under their company’s policies). The system should allow an admin to delete a user’s personal data if requested (without destroying project info – e.g., reassign tasks then delete the user record). Also, features like the external client view must be careful not to expose personal data of team members unless needed (e.g., maybe show first name, not full name to external clients by default, depending on contract).

- **Data Residency and Localization:** Enterprises (especially government or EU companies) may require that data be hosted in certain regions. The service architecture might allow choosing data center region for an enterprise customer to meet data residency laws. If multiple regions, ensure compliance and consistent service across.

- **Backups and Retention:** Regular backups (as mentioned in reliability) are part of compliance for disaster recovery (often a requirement to have DR plans). Data retention policies: allow clients to specify how long data is retained (some might want to purge old project data after X years for compliance). Or at least, the vendor should have a policy in place. Additionally, if a client leaves, provide a way to export all their data and then purge it from live systems if requested.

- **Secure Development:** Internally, follow secure coding practices (prevent SQL injection, XSS, CSRF protections tokens in forms, etc.). The product should undergo periodic **security audits and penetration testing**. Features like attachments should be scanned for viruses if the files can be uploaded, to prevent malware distribution.

- **Permissions Model Flexibility:** Possibly allow enterprises to define custom roles or tweak permissions, which is a compliance thing to fit their internal controls. E.g., a company might require that only Finance users can edit budget fields even if PMs normally can – so an ability to configure that is good (maybe an advanced feature).

- **Two-Factor and SSO Enforcement:** The admin settings should allow an enterprise to require 2FA for all local logins, or require SSO only (disable local logins). This ensures all access goes through their secure identity management.

- **Session Timeout and Auto-Logout:** To protect unattended terminals, auto-logout users after a period of inactivity (configurable, e.g., 15 minutes or 1 hour). Possibly allow “remember me” but with caution.

- **Privacy by Design:** Minimize sensitive personal data stored. For instance, do we need to store anything beyond names and emails for users? Probably not. Avoid storing things like social IDs or personal addresses. If notes or attachments might contain personal data (entered by users), that's content the users add – provide guidance in policies to not put confidential personal data unless necessary.

- **Client Data Segregation:** If using a multi-tenant model, ensure strict tenant isolation. All API calls and UI views must be scoped to the user’s organization. One client’s user should never be able to access another client’s projects, even if roles align by name, because internally there’s a tenant ID check. Testing should cover cross-tenant access attempts.

- **Compliance Features:** Enterprises might ask for features like **audit reports** (who accessed what data), **user access reviews** (admin can get a list of who has access to what projects to do periodic review), or even hold on deletion (legal hold if needed to preserve data). While not initially all implemented, we note these for roadmap to satisfy highly regulated customers.

- **Common Standards:** Align with **SOC2, ISO 27018 (cloud privacy), GDPR** as mentioned. Also if applicable, offer signing a **Data Processing Addendum (DPA)** for customers to address GDPR. If any health or financial data might be used, consider HIPAA or PCI, but likely not relevant for project management unless used in those contexts.

In essence, enterprise customers will expect that the tool “ensures your data is safe and private” with measures like encryption, SSO, 2FA ([10 Best Enterprise Project Management Software [2025]](https://www.smartsuite.com/blog/enterprise-project-management-software?105755a5_page=2#:~:text=Evaluate%20the%20security%20measures%20offered,especially%20during%20migration%2C%20if%20required)), and that the vendor has appropriate certifications. By implementing these security features and processes, the product not only protects client data but also becomes much easier to approve in enterprise security reviews (often a hurdle in B2B software adoption).

All these practices collectively give assurance that using the software will not introduce security risks and that it adheres to legal requirements for data protection.

## UI/UX Considerations

While this document is not focused on designing the user interface, it’s important to note certain **UI/UX requirements and principles** that will make the product effective and user-friendly. A good UI is critical for adoption – users should find the system intuitive and pleasant to work with. Here are key considerations:

- **Clean, Intuitive Layout:** The application should use a clean design with clear navigation. Common functions (like creating a task, updating status, switching views) should be easily accessible via obvious buttons or context menus. The use of whitespace and typography should make information scannable. For instance, project name and key stats might be at top, the main content (task list, board, etc.) fills most of screen, and a sidebar or menu provides navigation between modules (Overview, Tasks, Gantt, Resources, Reports, etc.). Consistent placement of these elements helps users muscle-memory.

- **Dashboard Home:** Upon login, a user might see a **home dashboard** showing their relevant info: projects they are involved in, their tasks due soon, and any notifications (comments, mentions, etc.). This gives an immediate sense of what needs attention. For PMs, maybe a quick stat of each project’s health on## UI/UX Considerations  
  The product’s user interface should be designed with clarity and efficiency in mind. Although detailed UI design is outside the scope of this PRD, the following guidelines highlight how the user experience must support the functional requirements:

- **Ease of Navigation:** Users should be able to navigate between projects and modules (tasks, resources, reports, etc.) easily via a consistent menu or navigation bar. The hierarchy of information (portfolio > project > task) should be visually clear, helping users understand context at a glance ([10 Best Enterprise Project Management Software [2025]](https://www.smartsuite.com/blog/enterprise-project-management-software?105755a5_page=2#:~:text=Look%20for%20software%20that%20has,ask%20to%20make%20informed%20decisions)). For example, a breadcrumb or header should always indicate which project and section the user is in. Common actions (add task, switch view) should be prominently accessible (e.g., an “Add Task” button or a view switcher toggle). The interface should be intuitive enough that team members can update their tasks without confusion ([10 Best Enterprise Project Management Software [2025]](https://www.smartsuite.com/blog/enterprise-project-management-software?105755a5_page=2#:~:text=Look%20for%20software%20that%20has,ask%20to%20make%20informed%20decisions)).

- **Consistent Design Language:** All parts of the application should use a consistent design language – fonts, colors, and icons that align with the brand and are uniform across modules. For instance, tasks might always be represented with a checkbox icon or similar, milestones with a flag icon, etc. Buttons performing similar actions should be the same color (e.g., primary actions in blue, caution actions in orange/red). Consistency reduces the learning curve.

- **Visual Clarity and Feedback:** Information should be presented in a clean, uncluttered way. Use visual cues to convey status: e.g., tasks past their due date in red text, completed tasks with a strikethrough or checkmark, milestones as diamond shapes on timelines. Where appropriate, use progress bars or badges (if a phase is 70% complete, show a small progress indicator). The UI must also provide immediate feedback on user actions – for example, if a user marks a task complete, the task should visibly change appearance (and maybe a subtle animation or checkmark appears) confirming the action was received. Undo options should be provided for critical actions like deletion (e.g., a snackbar “Task deleted – Undo”).

- **Drag-and-Drop & Inline Editing:** Many planning interactions should be doable with direct manipulation. Users should be able to drag tasks on the Gantt chart to adjust dates, drag cards on the Kanban board to change status, and drag and drop tasks in the WBS outline to reorder or change hierarchy. Inline editing (clicking on a task name to edit it right there) makes data entry faster than opening separate dialogs. These interactions should be smooth and undoable if a mistake is made. The UI must prevent invalid drags (for example, if dragging a task under one of its subtasks would create a loop, the system should not allow it).

- **Responsive and Adaptive Design:** The application should be usable on various screen sizes. On large screens, it can show multiple panes (e.g., task list and a details panel). On smaller screens (like tablets), it might switch to a single-column view with a menu. Key functionality (viewing tasks, updating status) should be accessible on a tablet or possibly a mobile device via a simplified interface or companion app. For example, a team member might quickly update a task status from a phone. At minimum, the web UI should be mobile-friendly for consuming information (if editing is too complex on phone, that’s acceptable initially). All interactive elements should be appropriately sized and spaced for touch on mobile.

- **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA). This includes providing text alternatives for icons (tooltips or aria-labels for screen readers), ensuring color contrast is sufficient (important information should not rely on color alone – e.g., use icons or text in addition to color coding for status), and enabling full keyboard navigation (tab through fields, use arrow keys to move tasks in a list, Enter to select, etc.). For example, a user who cannot use a mouse should be able to navigate the task list and mark tasks complete via keyboard shortcuts. Screen reader users should receive meaningful announcements (e.g., “Task ‘Design UI’ marked completed”). Testing the UI with accessibility tools is part of the acceptance criteria.

- **User-Centric Dashboard:** Each user (especially team members) should have a “My Work” or dashboard view summarizing what’s relevant to them. This might include: tasks assigned to them (with due dates), tasks due soon or overdue, and maybe a focus for today. Project managers could have a dashboard of project KPIs. Allow users to customize this if possible (e.g., an executive might choose to see a chart of each project’s progress on their home screen). This personalization ensures each role immediately sees value on login.

- **Notifications and Mentions:** If someone comments on a task and @mentions a user, or if a task is assigned to a user, the UI should highlight this with a notification indicator (bell icon or inbox). A notifications panel can list recent relevant events. This reduces reliance on email and keeps users engaged within the app. The design of notifications should be such that clicking one takes the user directly to the relevant item (deep linking within the app).

- **Contextual Panels and Details:** The UI can employ contextual detail panels. For example, clicking on a task could open a side panel with all its details (description, subtasks, comments, history) while keeping the main list or timeline visible. This avoids full page navigation and allows editing details without losing one’s place. Similarly, clicking a resource name might pop up their availability or contact info. These interactions should be quick (use async loading optimally, show spinners or skeleton screens while loading data).

- **Confirmation and Safety Nets:** For potentially destructive actions (delete project, remove user, etc.), the UI should ask for confirmation (e.g., modal “Are you sure? This will delete X tasks.”). In cases of bulk actions, perhaps list the items that will be affected in the confirmation. Also consider offering reversible actions like an “archive project” instead of permanent delete, to prevent accidental data loss. If a user attempts to navigate away with unsaved changes (like typing a long description), prompt them to save or confirm leaving to avoid losing work.

- **Performance and Responsiveness:** The front-end should be optimized to handle the data without lag. Techniques like virtual scrolling for long lists (rendering only visible rows) should be used. When there are many elements (like 1000 tasks in a Gantt chart), the UI should still scroll and zoom smoothly – possibly by simplifying rendering or grouping tasks into collapsible summaries to reduce on-screen clutter. Lazy load content (for example, don’t load all projects at once – load the user’s few projects first, load others on demand). All this ensures the app “feels” fast, which is a huge part of UX.

- **Modern Look and Feel:** While subjective, the application should look modern and professional to meet enterprise expectations. This could include support for a **dark mode** (many developers and users prefer dark themes for heavy use applications – as seen in some example images we referenced), theming options to match corporate branding, and generally using modern UI components (charts with tooltips, smooth animations where appropriate, etc.). However, any animations should be subtle and not hinder usability or performance.

- **User Help and Hints:** The first time a user enters a section (like the Resource calendar or the Reports builder), consider providing a quick guided tour or at least context-sensitive help links (e.g., a small “?” icon that explains what they can do on that page). For complex concepts (critical path, baseline), the UI can include an info icon with a brief explanation. This embodies _user education within the app_. Also, maintain updated external documentation and link to it (maybe a “Help/Documentation” menu item taking to knowledge base).

- **Cross-browser and Cross-platform Compatibility:** The web app should work on all modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) and not be restricted to one. Also ensure compatibility with both Windows and macOS environments in terms of look/feel (e.g., use OS-specific font rendering nicely). Test interactive elements on different browsers to ensure no quirks.

In summary, the UI should be **user-friendly, responsive, and supportive of the workflows** described in this document. A well-designed interface will complement the powerful features, allowing users to leverage them with minimal friction. By focusing on intuitive design and usability, the tool will facilitate quick adoption and become a natural part of the team’s daily work, rather than feeling like a burdensome system. (Consider that team members often juggle multiple tools; a clean and logically organized UI can make this tool stand out as easy to work with.)
