## Feature 1: Wide Variety of Classes

### Feature Overview and Description

The platform will offer a **wide variety of classes** across subjects, interests, and skill levels to ensure there is “a class for every interest.” This means covering traditional academic subjects (math, science, language arts, history), enrichment topics (music, art, coding, foreign languages), and unique interest-based classes (e.g. Minecraft-based math, creative writing for fans of specific books, science experiments, etc.). The breadth of class offerings is a core value proposition – families can find **core curriculum support or explore niche passions** in one place. By providing hundreds of categories and tens of thousands of classes, the platform can cater to learners with diverse interests and needs. This variety keeps learners engaged and encourages continuous learning as they can always find something new or appealing. Moreover, a broad catalog attracts a wide user base, from those seeking help with school subjects to those looking for fun extracurriculars. The class content will be primarily created and taught by independent educators (marketplace model), allowing for innovation and a constantly growing library of topics.

### User Personas and Use Cases

- **Curious Learner (Age 10):** A student who loves science and also enjoys hobby topics (like space, dinosaurs, or Pokémon). They use the platform to discover an astronomy class and a Pokémon-themed math class, satisfying both academic needs and personal interests. The wide variety keeps this learner engaged year-round as they hop from one fascinating topic to another.
- **Homeschool Parent:** A parent who homeschools their 8-year-old child uses the platform to supplement their curriculum. They can find traditional courses (e.g. a Grade 3 math class) and enrichment activities (like an art club or a beginner Spanish class) all in one place. The variety ensures the parent can cover all subjects and also incorporate fun electives.
- **Gifted Teen (Age 15):** A teenager who is advanced in certain subjects seeks out college-level or uncommon courses (e.g. an advanced coding workshop or a class on neuroscience). The platform’s broad catalog includes higher-level content and niche topics that challenge them beyond their school’s offerings.
- **After-School Enrichment Seeker:** A working parent wants constructive after-school activities for their 12-year-old. Using the platform, they find a **public speaking course**, a **chess club**, and a **digital art class**. This variety of options means the parent can schedule different activities each day, all via the same platform.

### Detailed Functional Requirements

- **Catalog and Taxonomy:** The system shall support an extensive catalog of classes organized by categories, sub-categories, age group, and skill level. It must allow browsing and searching by keywords, subject, interest, and other filters (e.g. “science,” “music,” “coding,” “anime drawing,” etc.).
- **Class Listings:** Each class listing will include a description, syllabus or topics covered, target age/grade range, schedule, and teacher info. The platform shall allow teachers to create classes covering any topic within content guidelines, enabling a broad array of offerings.
- **Search and Discovery:** Provide robust search functionality with autosuggestions and filtering (by age, topic, duration, price, schedule, etc.) so that users can easily find both popular subjects and obscure topics. Performance should handle large volumes of classes and return results within 2 seconds (see NFRs).
- **Recommendations:** Implement a recommendation engine or curated lists (e.g. “Popular in Science,” “New & Noteworthy,” “Trending for Teens”) to surface the breadth of content. This helps users discover classes they might not have thought to search for.
- **Class Capacity Management:** The platform must be able to list and manage tens of thousands of active classes. It should support teachers adding new classes continuously and learners enrolling in them without performance degradation. (For instance, Outschool’s marketplace offers 140,000+ live classes, so scalability is key.)
- **Content Guidelines & Moderation:** There must be a content approval process to ensure classes meet quality and safety guidelines. This allows offering a variety of topics while filtering out any inappropriate or off-policy subjects. (Every class’s content is reviewed before being offered.)
- **Multiple Formats:** Support various class formats to increase variety – one-time workshops, multi-week courses, ongoing clubs, pre-recorded flex classes – so that a range of learning modalities is available.
- **Class Updates:** The system shall allow dynamic updates (new classes added daily). It should handle scenarios like class cancellations or schedule changes gracefully and inform interested learners.
- **Scalability for Growth:** The architecture must accommodate an ever-growing list of classes and users globally (target: ability to reach millions of users and classes, as Outschool did with 1M+ learners and hundreds of thousands of classes). This implies scalable databases, efficient queries for class search, and CDN for content images.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Even with a very large catalog, class search and browsing must be fast and responsive. Search results should load within 2 seconds for a typical query. The system should use indexing and caching to handle the load of many concurrent users searching the catalog.
- **Scalability:** The platform must scale horizontally to support spikes in usage (e.g. beginning of school year rush). It should handle thousands of concurrent searches or class page views. Database design should efficiently handle the volume of class records (tens of thousands and growing).
- **Reliability:** The class catalog and search should have 99.9% uptime. Downtime of the discovery features could severely impact user trust (if users cannot find classes, the core value is lost). Use load balancers and failover for key services (search, database) to ensure high availability.
- **Usability:** Navigation through the broad catalog should be intuitive. This includes clear category labels, a filter UI that’s easy to use, and the ability to **preview key class info at a glance**. The design should avoid overwhelming users – e.g. by highlighting popular categories but still enabling deep dives into niche topics.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that the browsing and search interface is accessible (screen-reader friendly, proper contrast, etc.) so that users of all abilities can explore class offerings. This includes accessible filters and keyboard navigation for the class list.
- **Maintainability:** The system’s taxonomy of subjects should be maintainable by staff (e.g. adding new categories or merging ones as trends change). It should be easy to update content guidelines and implement any needed restrictions dynamically (for example, quickly hiding a class that violates policy).

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Class Search & Browse:** Given a parent is searching for classes, when they enter a broad term like “math” or a niche term like “LEGO,” then the system returns relevant class listings (with appropriate filters) within 2 seconds and displays at least 20 results, demonstrating the breadth of offerings.
- **Category Coverage:** When a user browses categories, they can find classes in all major academic subjects and multiple enrichment categories. For each top-level category (Science, Arts, Technology, Languages, etc.), at least 20 classes are available across different age groups (to ensure variety for each interest area).
- **New Class Addition:** When a teacher creates a new class and submits it for approval, the system processes this submission (stores it and flags for review). Upon approval by the content moderation team, the class becomes discoverable via search and browse in the appropriate category.
- **Content Moderation Workflow:** If a class topic is submitted that violates content guidelines (e.g., a banned topic), when a reviewer marks it as rejected, then the class is not published on the platform and the teacher is notified with a reason. This ensures only acceptable variety is offered.
- **No Dead-Ends in Discovery:** For any user interest query (within reason), the platform either shows relevant classes or gracefully handles it (e.g. “No classes found for X, try these related topics”). A wide variety means true edge interests should have at least some content, or the system should prompt the user to request a class if nothing exists.
- **Scalability Test:** Under a simulated load of 10,000 concurrent users searching and browsing, the system maintains acceptable response times (under 3 seconds for 95th percentile queries) and does not crash. This will validate that a large catalog can be handled in production scenarios.

### User Stories

- **As a parent**, I want to browse a wide range of class topics in one place, so that I can find courses that match my child’s specific interests and educational needs (whether that’s algebra or anime drawing) without hopping between different platforms.
- **As a student (age 13)**, I want to explore classes in topics I’m passionate about (like coding and game design) as well as discover new hobbies, so that learning online stays exciting and relevant to my interests.
- **As an educator/teacher**, I want to offer unique classes on this platform (for example, a course on ancient mythology or a knitting club) and reach students globally, so that I can share my niche expertise with those who are interested.
- **As a product manager**, I want the platform to categorize and present a huge variety of classes in a structured manner, so that users can easily find what they need despite the breadth of content. _(This story represents an internal stakeholder ensuring the feature meets business goals.)_

### Edge Cases and Constraints

- **Extremely Niche Topics:** In rare cases, a parent might search for a very obscure class (e.g. “Sumerian language for kids”). If none exists, the system should handle this gracefully (no results found message and perhaps an option to request the class). The platform might consider a **“Request a Class”** feature so that niche demand can be met by teachers in the future.
- **Overlapping Categories:** Some classes may fit multiple categories (e.g. a “History of Music” class). The system must allow tagging classes under multiple relevant categories or have a strategy to choose the best fit category while still making it discoverable via cross-tags or keywords.
- **Content Saturation:** If too many classes exist for a given popular topic, it could overwhelm users or cause some classes to never get enrollments. The platform might need to mitigate this by ranking algorithms (to surface higher-quality or more relevant classes) or by guiding teachers to underserved areas.
- **Class Removal:** If a class is removed (due to policy or teacher leaving), ensure it no longer appears in search results. Edge case: a user had bookmarked that class – they should see a message that it’s no longer available.
- **Internationalization of Content:** While the platform might initially cater primarily to classes in English, there could be classes offered in other languages (e.g. a Spanish math class). The search should handle different languages or at least clearly indicate the class language so users aren’t confused.
- **Age-Appropriateness:** A class might be very broad in topic but not appropriate for all ages (e.g. a complex science class suitable for teens only). The system must ensure age filters are respected – an edge case is a parent searching without filtering age could see a class not meant for their 6-year-old. Clear age labeling is needed to prevent inappropriate enrollments.
- **Performance in Low-Bandwidth Scenarios:** Some users in global markets might have slower internet. The class list should degrade gracefully (perhaps a text-only list or low-resolution images) if bandwidth is limited, so that the variety of classes is still browsable to them.

### Dependencies and Integrations

- **Search Engine/Index:** Integration with a search indexing service (like Elasticsearch or Algolia) to enable fast searching through the class database. This service must be tuned for the education domain (e.g. understanding synonyms like “biology” and “life science”).
- **Database:** A robust database (SQL or NoSQL) to store class listings with appropriate indexing on fields like title, description, categories for fast retrieval.
- **Content Management Tools:** Internal admin tools for the content moderation team to review and approve class listings. This includes workflow integrations for flagging content and communicating with teachers.
- **Analytics Tools:** Integration with analytics to track search queries, popular categories, and any “no result” queries. This data will help identify gaps in class offerings and drive teacher recruitment for those topics.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** For hosting images (class cover images, etc.) to ensure fast global load times when browsing classes (important as classes have images or videos in descriptions possibly).
- **Optional – AI Categorization:** In the future, the platform might integrate an AI service to auto-scan new class listings for content (to assist moderation) and to automatically tag them into categories using NLP. This could be a dependency if implemented, to maintain quality while scaling variety.

### Priority Level

**Priority:** Must Have.
_Rationale:_ A wide variety of classes is fundamental to the platform’s value proposition and differentiation. It’s a core promise to users that drives them to use this product over a more limited competitor. Without a broad catalog, many of the other features (flexible scheduling, global access, etc.) lose impact because users might not find the content they want. This feature must be present at launch with significant breadth, even if the catalog grows over time.

### Metrics/KPIs to Measure Success

- **Class Count & Category Coverage:** Number of active classes on the platform and the breadth of categories covered. For example, track that we have classes in 100% of defined core categories and monitor growth in niche categories. A successful metric might be “% of user searches that return at least one result” – aiming for a very high number (90-95%+) as a proxy for content breadth.
- **Enrollment Distribution:** Measure enrollments across categories. If only a few categories get all the enrollments, our variety isn’t effectively utilized. We’d expect a healthy distribution where multiple categories show significant enrollment, indicating users are finding value in various topics.
- **Repeat Usage:** Track how often learners take classes in different subjects. For instance, a KPI could be “X% of learners enroll in classes from 3 or more distinct subject categories within 6 months.” A high value would show that families are leveraging the variety (e.g. using the platform for both academic and extracurricular learning).
- **Search Success Rate:** Monitor the ratio of search queries that result in a click or enrollment. If users often search and then leave without clicking (or frequently get “no results”), it indicates missing content or poor discovery. Improving this over time means we successfully fill content gaps and help users find what they want.
- **Catalog Growth Rate:** The rate at which new classes are added, especially in new or niche topics. For example, aiming to add X new unique topics per quarter. Also, **retention of classes** (how many remain active) to ensure we maintain a large selection.
- **User Satisfaction:** Through surveys or feedback, gauge satisfaction with the selection of classes. For example, “On a scale of 1-5, how satisfied are you with the variety of classes available?” – target to maintain an average above a certain threshold (e.g. >4.0).

### Competitive/Market Benchmarking

In the current online learning market, a broad content offering is a key differentiator. **Outschool**, for example, boasts more than 140,000 live classes across numerous subjects, ensuring that learners can find almost any topic of interest. Competing platforms like traditional tutoring services or MOOCs often have a narrower focus – e.g., **Varsity Tutors** might focus mostly on academic subjects and test prep, and **Khan Academy** (a free resource) covers core academics but not live niche classes. This platform’s edge is combining the breadth of a MOOC library with the engagement of live teaching. Market research shows that parents value one-stop solutions: instead of juggling one platform for music lessons, another for coding, etc., they prefer a single marketplace where **“there really is something for everyone”**. To stay competitive, our platform must meet or exceed the content breadth of Outschool and similar marketplaces. That means continuously recruiting teachers to offer new subjects and monitoring trending interests (for instance, if “Roblox game design” becomes popular, ensuring such classes exist). By delivering on variety, we position the platform as a comprehensive solution in the online education space, unlike competitors that might be seen as niche or limited in scope.

## Feature 2: Small Group Live Classes

### Feature Overview and Description

The platform will facilitate **small group live classes**, meaning real-time online sessions with a limited number of students (for example, 3–10 learners per class) led by a teacher via video conference. Small group sizes are critical for ensuring each learner gets attention and has the opportunity to participate – unlike large webinars or traditional classrooms with 30+ students, our classes aim to recreate a seminar-like intimacy online. The live aspect means classes happen in real-time, allowing interaction, discussions, and immediate feedback. This feature focuses on creating an engaging and social learning experience: peers can learn together and from each other, while teachers can tailor their approach knowing there are only a handful of faces on screen. By keeping classes small, the platform can maintain high quality of instruction and student engagement. Research and market trends show that **“small-group learning experiences”** are a hallmark of successful online education for kids. For example, the Outschool platform specifically offers interest-based small-group classes over video chat to maximize interactivity. Our implementation will ensure easy scheduling and management of live sessions, tools for teacher-student interaction (like raising hands, chat, screen sharing), and safeguards to maintain a respectful, focused environment in each live class.

### User Personas and Use Cases

- **Shy Learner (Age 8):** A young student who feels lost in a big classroom finds confidence in a small online class of 5 peers. In this intimate setting, they feel comfortable asking questions and participating in activities. The teacher can give this learner personalized encouragement, something that wouldn’t happen in a larger group.
- **Engaged Teen (Age 14):** A teenager joins a weekly small-group debate class about current events. With only 6 students in the session, they get plenty of time to speak and debate with others. The live format makes it lively, and the small group means each student must come prepared – no one can “hide” in the back row. This improves their public speaking and critical thinking skills.
- **Teacher Persona – Ms. Lopez:** An experienced teacher who prefers interactive teaching loves small groups because she can get to know each student. She uses features like gallery view to see all students and breakout activities in class. For example, in a language class with 4 learners, she can hear each one practice speaking and provide immediate feedback, which would be impossible with a huge class.
- **Parent of a Child with Special Needs:** A parent enrolls their child (age 9, on the autism spectrum) in small group classes specifically because large groups can be overwhelming. With only a few other kids, the environment is more predictable and the teacher can better manage social dynamics. This parent values that the platform caps class sizes and that they can see the maximum class size before enrolling.

### Detailed Functional Requirements

- **Live Video Classroom Integration:** The platform shall integrate a reliable video conferencing solution (custom or third-party like Zoom API) that supports multiple video streams (for teacher and all students in the class). It must allow **at least 8–10 participants** with stable audio/video. Tools such as mute/unmute controls, raise hand feature, chat, and screen-sharing should be available to facilitate interaction.
- **Class Size Limits:** For each class listing, the teacher can set a maximum number of students (with a reasonable upper cap enforced by the system, e.g. max 12). The system shall prevent more enrollments once the class is full. If a class is full, it should offer a waitlist option to interested students.
- **Interaction Features:** Implement features to enhance small-group interaction: e.g. a virtual whiteboard everyone can draw on, breakout room capability (if a teacher wants to split a class of 8 into pairs for an activity), and emoji reactions for quick feedback (like thumbs up). These features encourage active participation from each student.
- **Roster and Attendance:** Provide the teacher with a roster of enrolled students and tools to track attendance in each live session. When class starts, the system shows which students are present. This helps manage small group dynamics (e.g. if only 2 show up out of 5, teacher knows how to adjust).
- **Scheduling and Notifications:** The system shall manage class session scheduling for live classes. Enrolled students (and their parents) get email/app notifications with the live session link and time. For recurring classes (multi-session courses or ongoing clubs), automated reminders should go out before each session.
- **Recording (Optional):** The platform may allow recording of live sessions (with privacy considerations) so that students who miss a small group class can catch up later. However, since these are minors, recording should be opt-in by parents and comply with privacy rules (recordings might be only the teacher’s video or screen, not showing other kids, to protect identities).
- **Classroom Controls for Teachers:** Teachers should have administrative controls in the live session: the ability to mute all or individual students, remove a disruptive student from the class if necessary, and moderate chat. These controls are crucial for safety and keeping the small group focused.
- **Latency and Quality:** The system should strive for low latency in audio/video (< 300ms delay ideally) so that conversation flows naturally. It must handle varying internet speeds by auto-adjusting video quality per user. **Non-functional**: ensure that even with 10 video streams, the system maintains audio clarity and reasonable video resolution for each participant.
- **Time Zone Support:** When scheduling live classes, the system should display times in the user’s local time zone (based on profile settings) and handle daylight savings changes. This ensures small group sessions happen in sync for all participants globally (ties into the Flexible Scheduling and Global features as well).

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance (Real-time):** The live class feature must support real-time communication. The video/audio streaming servers should have <1% packet loss and <250ms average latency for users in the same region. We may need distributed servers globally to achieve this (see Global Access). The UI should load the classroom in under 5 seconds.
- **Reliability:** Classes should not drop due to server issues. Aim for 99.5% uptime for the live class service during peak hours (since a crash during a class directly impacts users). If a disconnection occurs (client-side), the system should allow quick rejoin. There should be fallback options (like a phone dial-in or at least a chat communication) if video fails for some reason.
- **Scalability:** The system should handle many concurrent small classes. For example, if 1,000 classes of up to 10 students each are happening simultaneously (10,000 concurrent users), the infrastructure should support that load. This involves scalable video servers or leveraging cloud video APIs that auto-scale.
- **Security:** The live sessions must be secure. Only authenticated, enrolled students can join the class. Use unique meeting URLs or embedded sessions that aren’t publicly shareable. Implement waiting room or similar, so the teacher controls entry. Also, encrypt the video streams (e.g. using TLS) to protect privacy.
- **Privacy and Safety:** No session should be open to the public; all participants are known. Recording, if enabled, must be stored securely and accessible only to authorized users. Also, ensure compliance with COPPA – for example, the conferencing tool should not collect personal data from children beyond what’s necessary for class.
- **Usability:** The interface of the online classroom should be simple, especially for younger kids. Big, clear buttons for mute/unmute, a straightforward way to see the teacher and classmates (gallery view). It should work on common devices (PC, Mac, ideally tablets). Possibly provide a quick equipment test beforehand (mic/camera check) to reduce class start friction.
- **Accessibility:** The live class tool should support accessibility features, e.g. allow turning on live captions for hearing-impaired students, compatibility with screen readers for chat or raised-hand notifications, and keyboard shortcuts for essential functions. Even in small group, some learners might need these accommodations.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Class Size Enforcement:** Given a class is defined with max 6 students, when a seventh student attempts to enroll, then the system should prevent enrollment and offer a waitlist or alternative times. The teacher and existing students should see that the class is full at 6 students.
- **Live Session Functionality:** When a scheduled class session starts, then all enrolled students and the teacher can join the virtual classroom. They should be able to see and hear each other in real-time, use chat and raise-hand features, and the teacher can successfully moderate (mute/unmute, etc.). A test scenario: in a mock session with 1 teacher and 4 students, all participants can use the whiteboard and observe changes in real time with negligible lag.
- **Interaction Engagement:** In a user acceptance test, each student in a class should have the opportunity to speak or interact. A criterion might be: in a 30-minute session with 5 students, the teacher can hear from each student at least once (this is more qualitative, but can be verified via teacher feedback or class observation). The platform’s small group design should naturally allow this level of engagement.
- **Stability Under Load:** During a load test of a live class (simulate 10 video streams), the system maintains the call for at least 30 minutes without dropping participants. CPU/memory usage on a typical client machine remains reasonable (to not crash a user’s device). Also, if one student’s network is slow, it should downgrade their video without affecting others.
- **Security Check:** Attempting to join a live class from an unauthorized account (not enrolled) should fail. For example, if someone gets hold of a class link but is not enrolled, they should be placed in a waiting room or blocked, and the teacher notified. The acceptance is that no uninvited participant can disrupt a class.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility:** Acceptance test on various devices: a student on a Windows PC, another on an iPad, and another on a Chromebook can all join the same live session and use core features. Any essential class function (hearing audio, viewing shared screen) must work across these devices and common browsers or the platform’s app.

### User Stories

- **As a student**, I want to attend live online classes with a small group of peers, so that I can interact directly with the teacher and classmates and not feel lost in the crowd.
- **As a parent**, I want small class sizes for my child’s online lessons, so that I know they will get more personalized attention and won’t be just an anonymous face on a big webinar.
- **As a teacher**, I want to teach in a live virtual classroom with a manageable number of students, so that I can maintain high teaching quality, give each student feedback, and foster a collaborative atmosphere where everyone participates.
- **As a product designer**, I want to create features (like breakout rooms and reaction buttons) that enhance interaction in small groups, so that online classes are as engaging as in-person small seminars.
- **As a school administrator (partner)**, I want to ensure the platform’s class size policies align with quality standards (e.g., no more than 10 students per online session for effective learning), so that any classes we fund or recommend maintain educational effectiveness.

### Edge Cases and Constraints

- **No-Show or One-Student Scenarios:** If only one student enrolls or others don’t show up, what happens? The platform should have a policy (maybe the class proceeds as a one-on-one, or maybe it’s canceled if below a minimum). We should allow teachers to set a minimum number as well. Edge case: a “small group” class becomes a de facto tutoring session due to low turnout – the system should still compensate the teacher appropriately or have communicated rules (some platforms run the class anyway with whoever comes).
- **Student Join Mid-session:** A student might be late or drop and rejoin due to connectivity. The system should allow late entry (perhaps with a gentle notification sound so as not to disrupt too much). If a student’s app crashes, they should be able to rejoin quickly.
- **Background Noise / Distraction:** In small groups, if one student has loud background noise, it can disrupt the class. The teacher’s control to mute is crucial. Possibly an automated noise detection could prompt or auto-mute a user. This is a design consideration to maintain class quality.
- **Privacy in Home Environment:** Each student is effectively broadcasting from home. Edge: what if something inappropriate appears on a student’s webcam (like an unknowing family member in background)? Teachers should be trained for such cases, possibly pause video for that participant. The platform might consider virtual backgrounds or blur features to help.
- **Handling Disruptive Behavior:** Even in small groups, a student might behave disruptively (talk over others, share inappropriate content via screen share or chat). The teacher removing a student is a supported function, but then what? Possibly refund that student or follow up by the safety team. The system should capture logs or recordings (if enabled) to review incidents in small classes.
- **Bandwidth Constraints:** One participant having very low bandwidth could degrade experience. The system should adapt by turning off their video automatically or suggest them to join audio-only. Edge case: if a teacher has connectivity issues, the class might stall for everyone. There should be a backup plan (maybe co-host or reschedule).
- **Time Zone mix-ups:** If a small group class has students from different countries, misinterpretation of class time could happen (though we aim to handle time zones properly). An edge case: daylight savings changes might shift class time for some. The platform must send reminders in local time and maybe double-remind around DST transitions.
- **Maximum Capacity Reached Mid-Interest:** Suppose a class is very popular (only 5 slots) and many try to enroll at once. Two parents might click enroll for the last spot nearly simultaneously. The system needs to handle this race condition, only allowing one and giving a friendly message to the other that the class just filled up. Possibly maintain a waitlist with timestamp order to be fair.

### Dependencies and Integrations

- **Video Conferencing Service:** The platform might integrate with an existing service (Zoom, WebRTC-based custom solution, etc.). If using a third-party like Zoom, use their SDK/API to embed classes. If building custom (WebRTC), need media servers (like Jitsi or Twilio API) to handle multi-party calls. This is a major dependency that must be decided early.
- **Calendar/Scheduling Module:** The scheduling of classes ties to a calendar system. Integration with standard calendar formats (iCal/Google Calendar) would allow users to add class sessions to their personal calendars easily.
- **Notification System:** Email or in-app notification service to send class reminders and links. This could use services like SendGrid or Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications in a mobile app.
- **Device Compatibility:** If we provide a native mobile or tablet app, the live class feature needs to integrate with the device’s camera/microphone APIs and possibly use native libraries for WebRTC. On web, it should integrate with browser WebRTC capabilities. Ensuring all these integrate seamlessly is essential for cross-platform support.
- **Analytics and Monitoring:** Integration with monitoring tools to track call quality (e.g., logging average latency, jitter, user-reported quality feedback). This helps identify issues with the live class service. Possibly use something like Callstats or built-in analytics of the video provider to gauge performance.
- **Support System:** If a user has trouble joining a live class, they might need quick support. Integration with a support chat or helpline accessible from the classroom interface could be considered (not a must-have initially, but something to keep in mind so a panicked parent can get help when tech issues occur).

### Priority Level

**Priority:** Must Have.
_Rationale:_ Live small-group classes are the cornerstone of the platform’s interactive learning experience. Without live classes, the platform would just be a static course catalog. And without small group sizing, the classes could become impersonal or less effective. This feature directly impacts the platform’s quality of service and is a primary driver for parent and student satisfaction. Many competitive platforms highlight live, small classes as a key selling point (since they combine the benefits of social learning with personal attention). Thus, this is a must-have at launch. Even if some bells and whistles (like breakout rooms or advanced whiteboards) can be phased in, the basic capability to host live video classes with limited size is essential from day one.

### Metrics/KPIs to Measure Success

- **Class Engagement Rate:** Measure what percentage of class time is interactive. For example, in a 30-minute class, how many minutes on average do students spend speaking or actively participating (not just listening)? While hard to auto-measure, proxies could be tracked like number of student talk turns, or through post-class surveys (“Did you feel engaged?”). High engagement indicates small group format is working.
- **Student-to-Teacher Interaction:** Track the average number of interactions per student per class (could be messages sent, times unmuted to talk, etc.). If in small classes each student interacts at least a few times, it’s a good sign. E.g., target that in a typical session, each student speaks or chats at least 2 times on average.
- **Session Attendance Rate:** Once enrolled, do students actually attend the live sessions? High attendance (e.g. >90% of enrolled students attend on time) suggests that scheduling and reminders are effective and the live format is valued. Low attendance might indicate scheduling issues or that recorded options are making live less necessary.
- **Teacher Feedback:** Collect feedback from teachers on class size and tools. A KPI could be teacher satisfaction with the classroom tools (rated via periodic surveys). If teachers report they can manage the class well and engage everyone, it validates the small group design.
- **Retention of Students in Classes:** If a course has multiple sessions (say 8-week course), measure how many students stick through all sessions vs drop out. High retention across sessions implies the small class environment is conducive and students aren’t losing interest or getting frustrated.
- **Incidents in Class:** Track any negative incidents (disciplinary issues, technical failures) per number of classes. If small group classes are running smoothly, we expect very low incident rate (e.g. <1% of classes have a report of a disruption or tech issue). A rise in incidents might reveal needed improvements (like better controls or tech upgrades).
- **Fill Rate:** How often do small group classes reach their max capacity or at least a healthy number? If many classes go under-enrolled (e.g. only 1-2 students when max was 8), that could indicate either oversupply of similar classes or scheduling mismatch. We want a high average fill rate (perhaps >50% capacity on average) to ensure the small group dynamic (which typically needs at least 3-4 students to feel like a group) is happening.

### Competitive/Market Benchmarking

The small-group live class format is a defining feature of modern online learning platforms for kids. **Outschool** pioneered this model of interest-based small group classes via video chat. Competitors like **Varsity Tutors** and **Wyzant** historically focused on 1:1 tutoring, but even they have introduced group classes in recent years to mimic the success of interactive group learning. Brick-and-mortar extracurricular programs (e.g., local coding bootcamps for kids) often have 5-10 students per class as well, citing that range as ideal for engagement. Our platform’s competitive edge will be ensuring these small online classes feel as engaging as in-person ones. For benchmarking: Outschool generally limits most classes to around 6-8 learners for younger kids and maybe up to 12 for some teen seminars. We should observe similar limits as best practice. Additionally, competitors may not have invested in specialized classroom tools – for example, some might just use a plain Zoom meeting. We can differentiate by integrating education-specific features (like the collaborative whiteboard or quiz polls) to enhance learning. The market expectation (from user reviews of other platforms) is that technical quality must be high: parents won’t tolerate frequent call drops or poor audio. In summary, to meet or beat competition, our small group classes should combine **high-quality video conferencing** with **education-optimized features** and strict **class size policies** that together create a superior learning experience. Customer reviews of Outschool often highlight the benefit of small classes for personalized learning; we will aim to replicate and improve on that aspect to compete effectively.

## Feature 3: 1:1 Tutoring

### Feature Overview and Description

In addition to group classes, the platform will offer **1:1 tutoring**, which means a single student connecting with a dedicated tutor/teacher for a personalized session. This feature allows highly individualized instruction, tailored to the learner’s specific needs and pace. One-on-one tutoring sessions can be used for various purposes: homework help, ongoing mentoring in a subject, test preparation, or targeted skill building (such as a weekly piano lesson or reading intervention). By providing a 1:1 option, the platform appeals to users who need or prefer private attention – for example, to address learning gaps or to accelerate learning in a focused environment. The scheduling for tutoring is more flexible (often on-demand or set directly between parent and tutor) than group classes. This feature will involve a profile for tutors, the ability for parents/students to request or book a session at a mutually convenient time, and tools similar to the live class (video chat, whiteboard) but optimized for two participants. The **value proposition** of 1:1 tutoring is that it yields better outcomes for many learners by adapting completely to them; it’s essentially a personal coach. Many competitor services (like Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, etc.) specialize in one-on-one tutoring, so our platform should match that level of service to remain competitive. By integrating tutoring into the same ecosystem as classes, we offer families a unified solution: they can join group classes for social learning and book a tutor when intense focus or help is needed.

### User Personas and Use Cases

- **Struggling Student (Age 12):** A middle-schooler who is falling behind in math uses the platform to get a weekly one-on-one math tutoring session. The tutor goes over class homework, re-teaches concepts they didn’t grasp in school, and prepares them for upcoming tests. The student’s confidence and grades improve thanks to the personalized attention, which wasn’t possible in their crowded school classroom.
- **Exam Prep High-Schooler (Age 17):** A teen is preparing for the SAT exam. They schedule a series of one-on-one tutoring sessions focusing on SAT math and SAT verbal separately. The tutor provides tailored strategies and practice problems. The individualized feedback helps the student significantly improve their score compared to self-study.
- **Young Learner (Age 6) for Reading:** A parent notices their first-grader is struggling with reading. They book a 1:1 tutor who specializes in early literacy. In these private sessions, the tutor uses interactive stories and phonics exercises at the child’s pace. This setup helps the child make progress without the pressure of other peers or the risk of feeling embarrassed.
- **Adult Perspective – Busy Parent:** A busy parent likes the idea of 1:1 tutoring because it can fit into their schedule more easily. They find a tutor on the platform who offers evening slots. The parent communicates directly with the tutor through the platform messaging to set up a convenient time each week for their 9-year-old’s coding lesson. The flexibility and direct coordination are a big plus.
- **Teacher Persona – Tutor:** A qualified tutor in physics signs up to offer one-on-one sessions. He enjoys that he can set his hourly rate and manage his calendar. In a 1:1 setting, he can really dive deep into problem areas (like specific physics problem sets) with a student, which he finds rewarding. The platform sends him student requests which he can accept or propose new times for, making it easy to fill his schedule.

### Detailed Functional Requirements

- **Tutor Profiles and Ratings:** Each tutor (teacher offering 1:1 sessions) shall have a profile page listing their expertise, qualifications, availability schedule, and hourly rate or session pricing. Parents/students can read reviews from past tutees (similar to class ratings, see Feature 15). The profile should also indicate the subjects/levels they tutor (e.g. “Algebra II, Calculus, SAT Math”).
- **Booking System:** The platform needs a booking interface for one-on-one sessions. This could be either **on-demand scheduling** (the tutor lists available time slots and student selects one) or a request model (parent requests a general time and the tutor confirms). The system must handle time zone conversions and only allow bookings when both parties are available. After booking, both tutor and student get confirmations and the session is placed on their calendars.
- **Payment Handling:** The system should support paying per tutoring session (or package). For example, a 60-minute session at \$40. The parent should be charged upon booking (or possibly after the session if there’s a satisfaction guarantee). It should also allow purchasing multiple sessions or recurring bookings conveniently. Transactions need to account for platform fees and tutor payouts.
- **Private Video Classroom:** Use the same or a similar live class interface but simplified for 2 people. It should allow screen-sharing, a collaborative whiteboard or document editor (for solving problems together), and possibly session recording for the student’s later review. In a 1:1, both participants should have full ability to interact (it’s essentially like a Zoom call between two people with interactive tools).
- **Session Notes & Homework:** Provide a feature for tutors to write session notes or assign homework within the platform. After each session, the tutor can summarize what was covered and suggest practice tasks. The student/parent can view these notes later. This helps track progress in ongoing tutoring relationships.
- **Communication & Rescheduling:** Built-in messaging between parent/student and tutor to discuss goals or reschedule if needed (without sharing personal contact info for safety). The system should allow cancellation or rescheduling according to a policy (e.g., must cancel >24 hours in advance for refund, etc.). If a tutor needs to adjust a time, they can propose a new time via the platform and the student can accept.
- **Matching/Discovery:** A way to find the right tutor: search or filter by subject, availability, price, etc. Possibly a “find a tutor” wizard where a parent inputs what they need (“Looking for a math tutor for a 7th grader, evenings”) and the platform shows matching tutor profiles. There could also be a **Concierge integration** (Feature 19) where staff or an AI helps recommend a tutor.
- **Trial Session or Guarantee:** Allow first-time users to have a trial tutoring session or a satisfaction guarantee. For instance, a policy like Wyzant’s _Good Fit Guarantee_ where if the first hour isn’t satisfactory, it’s refunded. Our system should be able to mark a session as a trial and handle refunds automatically if conditions are met.
- **Session Reminder and Join Process:** Send reminders (email/app) a few hours before the session. The join process should be seamless: from the dashboard or link, clicking “Join Session” should open the video room. If the tutor is late or student is late, perhaps notify the other party. Possibly include a timer to track session length if we charge by time.
- **Post-Session Feedback:** After each tutoring session, prompt the student or parent to leave a rating/review for the tutor. This will feed into the tutor’s profile and help maintain quality. Also allow tutors to mark the session as completed and potentially log topics covered (for their records or parent info).

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The booking and profile system should respond quickly – searching for tutors or viewing calendars should be under 2 seconds to load. The one-on-one video should have equal performance requirements as small group classes (low latency, stable connection) since quality is expected to be at least as good if not better with fewer people.
- **Reliability:** Ensure the booking system doesn’t double-book a tutor or allow scheduling conflicts. The calendar needs to handle concurrency if multiple requests come in for the same slot – only one should succeed. Also, the system should handle cancellations properly (freeing up slots).
- **Scalability:** The tutoring feature should scale with possibly thousands of tutors and students. Searching through tutors might require indexing like class search. The video infrastructure here might be lighter (only 2 per call, which is easier on servers), but if thousands of 1:1 sessions happen simultaneously, the system should handle it (via scalable servers or third-party service).
- **Security:** Protect privacy in 1:1 communications. All messaging and video should be encrypted. Additionally, because it’s an adult (tutor) alone with possibly a minor in a session, extra safety measures are needed: the platform might maintain logs or even random check-ins. At minimum, ensure all tutors passed background checks (see Feature 5) and all communications remain on-platform. No sharing of personal contact info in messages should be allowed to protect both parties.
- **Compliance:** 1:1 sessions with minors should comply with relevant regulations (e.g., if recording sessions, obey COPPA by getting parental consent, etc.). Also, handle tutoring across borders (if a tutor in UK is tutoring a US student, ensure no laws are broken; likely it’s fine but be aware of any tutoring-specific regulations or labor laws).
- **Usability:** The scheduling UI should be very user-friendly. Booking a tutor should feel as easy as booking a seat in a class, if not easier. For instance, a parent should be able to see a tutor’s next available slots at a glance and click one to book without confusion. The interface for tutors to set availability should also be straightforward (maybe an interactive weekly calendar they can block out).
- **Notifications and Timing Accuracy:** The system’s clocks and time zone handling must be accurate. If a session is at 5 PM for the student but the tutor is in another time zone, both need correct local times. The system should also gracefully handle when clocks shift (DST).
- **Mobile Support:** Many might use tutoring on tablets or phones, so ensure the experience (booking, video session) is mobile-compatible. Possibly provide an app for easier notifications and joining on mobile.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Tutor Search & Profile View:** Given a parent searches for a “Spanish tutor”, when they apply filters (age group = elementary, for example), then the system returns a list of tutors that match (Spanish tutors who teach that age), each with a brief profile summary and rating. Clicking a tutor opens their full profile with details like bio, subjects, and available times. The user can view this without errors or excessive load time.
- **Booking Flow:** When a parent selects an available time slot on a tutor’s profile and confirms booking with payment, then the session appears in both the student’s and tutor’s schedules (dashboard or calendar) and confirmation notifications are sent. The time slot should now be marked as taken on the tutor’s calendar to prevent others from booking it.
- **Session Start:** At the scheduled time, both tutor and student can join the 1:1 session via the platform. For acceptance, we test that at the time (or a “Join” button appears 5 minutes before start), clicking it successfully opens the private virtual classroom and both parties connect with audio/video.
- **Interaction in Session:** Within the 1:1 classroom, the student and tutor should be able to use all intended tools (e.g., if there’s a whiteboard, both can draw on it and see updates immediately; if screen sharing, the tutor can share a document and the student sees it). A test scenario: tutor shares a PDF of a worksheet, student can annotate or point to things on it, confirming collaboration works.
- **Payment and Completion:** After the session, the system automatically processes the payment to the tutor (minus platform fee) or marks the session as completed for payout in the next cycle. Acceptance if the financial transaction is logged correctly and the parent’s account shows the charge. If a satisfaction guarantee is invoked (e.g., parent indicates it wasn’t satisfactory within allowed time), the system can issue a refund per policy.
- **Cancellation Policy:** If a parent tries to cancel a session less than 2 hours before start (edge case), the system either prevents it or warns them of penalty (depending on our policy). If more than 24 hours before, it should allow cancellation and automatically notify the tutor and refund the parent’s payment or credit. A test: scheduling a session for tomorrow, then cancelling it today should result in slot opening up for others and appropriate notifications.
- **Messaging & Coordination:** Before a session, if a parent sends a message to the tutor through the platform (e.g., “My child needs help on chapter 5 problems specifically”), the tutor should receive that message and be able to reply. Acceptance: messages appear in both users’ message inbox, with email notifications perhaps, and no personal emails are revealed.

### User Stories

- **As a parent**, I want to book one-on-one tutoring for my child in specific subjects, so that they can receive personalized help and improve in areas where they struggle (or advance further in areas where they excel).
- **As a student**, I want to have private tutoring sessions where I can ask any question without fear of judgement and work at my own pace, so that I can properly understand difficult material and gain confidence.
- **As a tutor (teacher)**, I want to offer one-on-one sessions through the platform, so that I can reach students who need individualized help and manage my tutoring appointments and payments efficiently in one place.
- **As a platform administrator**, I want the tutoring feature to integrate smoothly with our class offerings, so that users have a consistent experience and we can track usage, ensure safety (background-checked tutors), and maintain quality across all services.
- **As a product strategist**, I want to offer both small group classes and 1:1 tutoring, so that the platform covers a broad range of learning scenarios – group learning for collaboration and private tutoring for personalized learning – making it a comprehensive education solution.

### Edge Cases and Constraints

- **Last-Minute Bookings:** A parent might try to book a session starting in 10 minutes. Are tutors available on-demand? The system might restrict booking too last-minute (maybe require at least 12 hours notice) or allow if a tutor marked themselves “online now”. If on-demand is allowed, need a mechanism to show only tutors currently available.
- **No-Shows:** What if either party doesn’t show up to the session? If a tutor is a no-show, the parent should automatically get a refund and possibly some credit or apology, and that tutor’s reliability rating is affected. If a student (or parent) no-shows, the tutor should possibly still be paid (depending on cancellation policy). The system should mark attendance and handle the financial outcomes accordingly.
- **Tutor-Student Fit Issues:** After a session, a parent might feel the tutor wasn’t a good fit (even if the tutor did nothing wrong). The platform might allow switching tutors or trying a different one easily. Perhaps offer the first session as a trial with minimal risk (tie-in with risk-free feature).
- **Time Zone Confusion:** A tutor in GMT and a student in PST arrange a time but one misinterprets AM vs PM or time zone, resulting in a missed session. The platform UI must clearly state the session time in both user’s local times and perhaps show a countdown. If such confusion happens, consider how to resolve (maybe reschedule without penalty if it was truly a misunderstanding and not negligence).
- **Overlapping Sessions:** A tutor might accidentally schedule sessions back-to-back with no buffer, and if one overruns slightly or they need a break, it’s problematic. Perhaps encourage or enforce a small buffer (like 5 minutes) between back-to-back bookings for tutors to avoid overlap issues.
- **Child Protection:** A potential edge scenario – since tutoring is one adult one child, we need measures to ensure appropriate behavior. Perhaps allow parents to sit in or observe if they want. The platform could also choose to record sessions (with consent) or at least randomly monitor them (Trust & Safety might join a session invisibly for audit? Though that’s sensitive). At minimum, there should be an easy way for a student to report any uncomfortable behavior.
- **Technical Issues Mid-Session:** If the session call drops due to technical issues (internet outage), how to handle? Possibly allow them to easily reconnect, or reschedule remaining time. The tutor might extend the session if possible once reconnected. If completely failed, perhaps refund or credit unused time.
- **Multiple Students in “1:1”:** Sometimes a parent might ask, “Can I include my second child in the session as well?” This becomes a small group of 2 students + tutor. Our 1:1 feature is meant strictly for one student, but we might clarify policy (either disallow or allow if tutor agrees, perhaps requiring an upgraded price). If allowed, the system should know so that both learners are covered by the same session.

### Dependencies and Integrations

- **Scheduling Calendar Integration:** Possibly integrate with external calendars for tutors (so they can sync their Google Calendar to automatically mark busy times) to prevent double-booking with their outside commitments. Also allow parents to add sessions to their calendar easily.
- **Payments and Refunds:** Integration with the payment gateway (Feature 11 touches on pricing) to charge for tutoring sessions. If we allow packages or subscriptions (e.g., pay for 5 sessions upfront for a slight discount), the system should integrate with that logic. Also integrate with whatever refund system for cancellations or guarantees.
- **Video Conferencing:** Same dependency as small group classes – might use the same underlying video service but configured for one-on-one (possibly enabling higher video quality since only two streams). If using an API like Twilio or a built-in WebRTC, ensure it works well for P2P calls.
- **Messaging System:** Integration with an internal messaging or CRM to handle communications between tutor and student. Possibly moderation tools on those messages (to ensure no sharing contact info or inappropriate content – an AI content filter might be integrated for safety).
- **User Identity and Account Management:** Ensure the student who attends is the one who was booked. This might tie into profile settings (the parent could have multiple children profiles and must select which child the tutor will be teaching). The tutor should know which learner (age, first name perhaps) to expect. So integration with user profiles (child sub-accounts under parent) is needed.
- **Analytics:** Need to integrate tracking of tutoring sessions: number of sessions, duration, outcomes. This might integrate with a learning progress system if any (to show improvement over time) or at least provide data for admin dashboards.
- **Customer Support Tools:** If issues arise (no-shows, disputes), our support team needs tools to see what happened. For instance, logs of attendance, chat transcripts, etc. Integration of the tutoring scheduling system with admin dashboards for manual adjustments or refunds is necessary for operational support.

### Priority Level

**Priority:** Must Have (High).
_Rationale:_ While the platform’s initial differentiation may come from group classes, 1:1 tutoring is a must-have to be a full-spectrum education platform. Many families specifically seek one-on-one help for certain needs and might choose a competitor if we lack this. Given that major competitors (Varsity Tutors, Tutor.com, etc.) focus heavily on tutoring, our platform should include it to not lose that segment of the market. Moreover, our prompt specifically lists 1:1 tutoring as a key feature, implying it’s critical. If it’s too complex to launch on day one alongside classes, it could potentially be phased in shortly after launch, but it should be treated as a high priority feature. It leverages much of the same infrastructure as live classes (video, scheduling) so it’s a logical extension. In summary, to meet user expectations and be competitive, 1:1 tutoring should be available as a core offering.

### Metrics/KPIs to Measure Success

- **Utilization Rate of Tutors:** Track how many tutors are actively engaged (sessions per week) and what percentage of their available slots get booked. A healthy platform will have a good match of supply and demand – e.g., if tutors overall have >70% of their slots filled, that indicates strong usage (though we also want enough supply to handle peak demand).
- **Repeat Tutoring Sessions:** A key success metric is the retention of tutoring relationships. For example, measure the percentage of first-time tutoring sessions that lead to a follow-up session with the same tutor. High repeat rates (e.g. 60-70% of users schedule another session) would indicate satisfaction and value.
- **Student Progress/Outcomes:** Harder to quantify, but through surveys or proxy metrics: e.g., after a series of sessions, does the student or parent report improvement (in grades or confidence)? Possibly include a feature for parents to rate progress after a few sessions (“Has your child’s understanding improved?”). Success could be measured by a majority saying yes.
- **Session Volume & Growth:** Number of 1:1 sessions completed on the platform per week/month. We’d watch this as a growth metric. Also, the ratio of tutoring sessions to group classes might be interesting – if too low, maybe the feature isn’t discovered or attractive enough; if very high, it might become a major revenue driver.
- **Satisfaction Ratings:** Average rating of tutors by students/parents after sessions. We want to maintain high quality: aim for average ratings in the 4.5+ (out of 5) range. If ratings drop or certain tutors consistently get low ratings, that’s a signal to intervene (additional training or deactivation).
- **Booking Conversion Rate:** How many profile views or tutor searches lead to a booking. If a lot of people search but don’t book, maybe our pricing is off or selection is insufficient. Increasing this conversion over time (through better matching algorithms or more tutor supply) is a goal.
- **Time to Match:** How long does it take on average for a student to find and book a tutor for a given request? If we offer a request/concierge service, measure that timeline. Ideally, a user can get a tutor within, say, 24 hours of deciding to get one (depending on urgency). If users frequently wait days to find someone, we might need more supply or better instant matching.

### Competitive/Market Benchmarking

One-on-one tutoring is a crowded market with established players. **Varsity Tutors** and **Wyzant** provide extensive tutor marketplaces with profiles, ratings, and the ability to have online sessions. These competitors often tout features like 100% satisfaction guarantees (e.g., Wyzant’s first hour guarantee) and a wide selection of tutors across subjects. Our platform should match such guarantees to build trust – for instance, offering a refund if the first session isn’t a good fit. In terms of technology, competitors have online tutoring tools: for example, Varsity Tutors has a custom online classroom with features like a drawing board and session recording. We should ensure our 1:1 classroom is on par with these, including interactive tools for subjects like math (drawing tools) or English (text editor). Pricing-wise, the market shows a range; our platform might allow tutors to set their rates, but we need to ensure it stays affordable (Feature 11 addresses pricing). The **integration of classes and tutoring** can be a competitive advantage – platforms like Outschool recently expanded into 1:1 tutoring as well, meaning customers can get both in one place. We will emphasize that synergy: e.g., a student can take a group class and then do 1:1 sessions for extra help with the same teacher if desired. From a market standpoint, to compete, we should also ensure our vetting of tutors is strong (which ties to Feature 5). Competitors often advertise “expert tutors” and rigorous screening. By leveraging our vetting processes (background checks, etc.) and highlighting tutors’ qualifications in profiles, we can instill confidence. Ultimately, success in 1:1 tutoring will be measured by whether families choose our platform over standalone tutoring services. Offering convenience (easy scheduling), quality (vetted, rated tutors), and guarantees will position us well in the competitive landscape of private tutoring.

## Feature 4: Flexible Scheduling

### Feature Overview and Description

Flexible Scheduling refers to the platform’s ability to accommodate the varied and busy timetables of families by offering classes and tutoring at many different times and allowing users to find options that fit their schedule. In practice, this feature means classes are available **throughout the day and week**, not just in a fixed “school day” window, and that multiple session times or formats (one-time, short sessions, long sessions, self-paced) are offered. For live classes, flexible scheduling might involve the same class being offered at different times by the teacher (e.g., a morning section and an evening section) to suit different time zones and routines. It also implies that enrolling and unenrolling in classes is convenient – for example, families can join an “ongoing” class at any point or easily reschedule a tutoring session. Essentially, the platform should adapt to the user’s schedule, rather than forcing the user to adapt to a rigid schedule. This is a major selling point for online education: the ability to learn **“on your schedule”** as opposed to traditional fixed schedules. We will implement features like filtering classes by time availability, calendar integration, make-up class options, and possibly recording alternatives for missed sessions (so that missing a class doesn’t mean falling behind). The outcome is that both full-time homeschoolers (who might prefer daytime classes) and school-going kids (who need evenings/weekends) can use the platform equally well, and global users in different time zones can also find suitable times.

### User Personas and Use Cases

- **Working Parent with Busy Schedule:** A parent who works 9–5 wants their child to take enrichment classes. They use flexible scheduling filters to find classes that happen in the early evening or on weekends. For instance, they find a 7 PM science class on Wednesday that fits after dinner, and a Saturday morning art workshop. The platform’s variety of times lets them balance classes with their work and family commitments.
- **Homeschool Family:** A homeschooling parent has more daytime availability and wants to schedule classes during regular school hours for their 10-year-old. They find morning classes for math and early afternoon for history, aligning with their at-home schedule. If a class they want is only offered at night, they might request a new section. The platform often provides multiple time slots for popular classes, some specifically catering to homeschoolers during school-day hours.
- **International Student:** A learner in Asia wants to take a class taught by a teacher in the US. Due to time difference, the student prefers classes that are in their early morning (which is evening for the teacher). The platform shows class times in the student’s local time and might offer options like “flex” (asynchronous) classes if live times don’t match. The student enrolls in a flexible “pre-recorded” course for one subject and a live class scheduled on a weekend night for another to make it work.
- **Teen with Extracurricular Conflicts:** A 15-year-old is on a sports team with practices on certain days. She needs a tutoring session but can only do it on Tuesdays and Fridays when she’s free. She finds a tutor who has availability on those specific days. Also, she joins an ongoing book club class that has multiple meeting options per week – she chooses the Friday slot instead of Monday because of her schedule. The platform’s flexibility allows her to engage without dropping other activities.
- **Teacher Persona – Part-Time Teacher:** A teacher who is offering classes on the platform also benefits from flexible scheduling. Suppose she is a school teacher by day and only free to teach online in the evenings. The platform tools let her set up class sections at 8 PM and on weekends. She can also list alternative times if enough students express interest. Flexibility features (like minimum enrollment rules and easy rescheduling) mean she can manage a schedule that fits her life while still reaching students.

### Detailed Functional Requirements

- **Multiple Schedule Options for Classes:** The platform shall allow teachers to offer the same class at multiple times (different sections) and list all upcoming schedules on the class listing. Users should easily see all available sessions and choose the one that suits them. For example, a “Creative Writing” class might have a Monday 5 PM section and a Saturday 10 AM section; both are visible to potential enrollees.
- **Time Filter & Calendar View:** A filtering tool for class search by time/day. E.g., users can filter for classes that take place on specific days of week or times of day (“show classes between 4 PM–8 PM on weekdays”). Additionally, a calendar view interface can show what classes are available at a given hour or what a user is enrolled in.
- **Ongoing Enrollment and Make-up Classes:** Support rolling enrollment for ongoing classes or clubs – meaning a student can join at any week. The system should handle pro-rating or rolling curriculum where needed. If a student misses a session, provide options: maybe they can attend a different section that week or watch a recording (if available). For one-time or short courses, allow easy reschedule or transfer if a timing conflict arises (subject to teacher approval/policies).
- **Class Rescheduling Tools:** If a teacher needs to reschedule a class session (due to emergency, etc.), the system should notify enrolled students and ideally propose a new time. Similarly, if a majority of students in a section request a different time, the teacher could adjust it. The platform should support such changes (including time zone calculations and avoiding conflicts).
- **Flex (Asynchronous) Classes:** To maximize scheduling flexibility, the platform can offer an option for “Flex classes” – which are pre-recorded or asynchronous courses that students can do on their own schedule (with perhaps some periodic check-ins). While not live, these are an important supplement when live times can’t match. The system should label these clearly and provide the content in a structured schedule (e.g., 4-weeks of materials released weekly).
- **Time Zone Auto-Detection:** The platform must automatically detect or ask for the user’s time zone and display all class times in their local time. A user should not have to convert times manually. If a user travels to another time zone, ideally the platform could update or at least allow manual setting to ensure correct display.
- **Availability Windows in Profile:** Allow users (especially parents) to set preferred availability times in their profile (e.g., “My child is free Mondays 3-6 PM and weekends”). Then the platform can surface classes within those windows, or the concierge service (Feature 19) can use that info. For tutors, allow them to mark specific available times (as part of their profile, integrated with Feature 3’s booking system).
- **Notification of New Sections:** If a class a user wants is not at a good time, they should be able to express interest (e.g., “Notify me if this class is offered at a different time”). If the teacher schedules a new section, those interested get notified, improving flexibility and filling classes.
- **Family Scheduling (Multiple Kids):** If a parent has multiple children, they might need to coordinate schedules. Perhaps provide a combined calendar for all enrolled classes for all their kids, and highlight conflicts. This could help them choose classes that don’t overlap inconveniently.
- **Membership Plan Integration:** If using Feature 10 (Rolling Credits/Plans), ensure that scheduling flexibility doesn’t conflict with how credits are applied (e.g., if rescheduling or switching classes, credits should carry over properly). The plans might allow certain number of classes per week – so scheduling changes should reflect on their usage.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **System Time Consistency:** All scheduling and time computations must use a consistent, reliable time basis (likely UTC under the hood with conversion to local). The system should gracefully handle daylight savings shifts and not create duplicate/missing hour issues (e.g., using libraries for time zone management).
- **Performance:** Searching or filtering by time should be efficient. Even with thousands of classes, queries like “classes available after 5 PM today” should execute quickly (perhaps by pre-computing or indexing classes by time slots). The calendar views should load quickly and handle lots of entries (for a power user with many enrollments).
- **Reliability:** The scheduling system must be robust – it’s bad if times display incorrectly or if a reschedule fails to notify someone. Notifications about schedule changes or upcoming classes should have near-100% reliability (they are time-sensitive). Use redundant channels (email + app push) to ensure the user sees it.
- **User Control:** Despite automation, always allow user manual control – e.g., if auto-detected time zone is wrong, let them override. Also allow them to opt out of certain notifications if they become too many (like maybe they don’t want notifications for new sections, they just check manually).
- **Concurrency and Data Integrity:** If many users adjust schedules at once or join/leave classes, ensure the system handles those concurrent updates. For instance, if a teacher moves a class time while a parent is in process of enrolling, it should handle gracefully (maybe locking enrollment during reschedule or updating the info on the fly).
- **Scalability:** As the platform grows globally, the variety of time zones and schedules grows. The system should support class schedules far into the future (some might schedule months ahead). Also, peak usage might have many classes starting on the hour – ensure the system (notifications, video spin-ups) can handle hundreds of classes starting at e.g. 5:00 PM with thousands of users joining simultaneously.
- **UX Clarity:** Given the complexity of scheduling, the UI/UX should minimize confusion. Non-functional but crucial: clearly show the day and date along with time to avoid AM/PM or date mix-ups. Use 12h vs 24h based on locale perhaps. Show countdowns to next session to help users. Essentially, design to prevent human error in interpreting schedules.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Time Zone Display:** If a teacher schedules a class for 3 PM Pacific Time, a student in Eastern Time browsing that class should see it listed as 6 PM Eastern in their interface. Acceptance: a test where a class is made in one zone and viewed from another shows correct conversion. Additionally, if the user switches their profile time zone, all class times update accordingly.
- **Schedule Filtering:** Given a parent wants classes on Fridays after 4 PM, when they set the filter to Friday and 4–8 PM, then the search results only show classes with sessions in that timeframe (e.g., a class that has a Friday 5 PM section would show, but a class only offered on Monday would be filtered out). Check that multiple filters (day + time + category) all work together.
- **Booking Without Conflict:** If a student is already enrolled in a class at Monday 5 PM, the system should warn or prevent them from double-booking another class at Monday 5 PM. Acceptance: try to enroll the same student in two classes that overlap – the system should either give a warning “You have a conflict with Class X at this time” or not allow it unless explicitly overridden.
- **Reschedule Notification:** When a teacher changes the time of a session (e.g., moves next week’s class from 3 PM to 4 PM), then all enrolled students receive a notification of the change within minutes and their dashboard reflects the new time. Acceptance test: simulate a reschedule and verify that the student’s view updates and an email/push is received.
- **Join Links and Calendar Integration:** A user should be able to add a class or tutoring session to their personal calendar easily. Acceptance: from the class enrollment confirmation, clicking “Add to Calendar” produces a correct .ics file or integration that populates the right date/time and meeting link. Also, at the scheduled time, the user’s dashboard has a “Join now” button that becomes active, and it correctly launches the class.
- **Flex Class Accessibility:** If a user enrolls in a flex/asynchronous class, the platform should clearly indicate that there are no live meeting times. Acceptance: the class page for a flex class shows “Flexible Schedule – no live meetings” and after enrollment, the student can access weekly content as it’s released (simulate week progression and ensure content unlocks).
- **Waitlist/Alternate Time Notification:** If a student joins a waitlist for a class that currently has no suitable time (or is full at all times), and a new section is opened by a teacher, the system sends a notification and perhaps automatically reserves a spot or prompts the waitlisted user to enroll. Acceptance: test that a waitlist triggers an email when a new section is added.

### User Stories

- **As a parent**, I want to find classes and tutoring that fit into our busy family schedule, so that my child can participate in online learning without conflicting with school or other activities.
- **As a student**, I want the flexibility to learn at times that I feel most productive or free (e.g., evenings or weekends), so that I can manage school, homework, and extracurriculars alongside these online classes without stress.
- **As a teacher**, I want to offer classes at times that different audiences can attend (maybe one in the morning, one in the evening), so that I can reach more students and accommodate those in different time zones or with different schedules.
- **As an international user**, I want the platform to present class times in my local time zone and offer classes throughout the 24-hour day, so that I can join live sessions conveniently from my country.
- **As a homeschool educator**, I want classes to be available during typical school hours and possibly shorter, more frequent sessions, so that I can integrate them smoothly into my homeschooling curriculum during the day.
- **As a product support specialist**, I want the system to handle schedule changes and notifications automatically, so that I rarely have to manually intervene for scheduling issues and users always have up-to-date information about when their classes are.

### Edge Cases and Constraints

- **Daylight Savings Transitions:** Twice a year time shifts could cause confusion. Edge: a class meets every Sunday at 10 AM Eastern. When DST starts or ends, the local time of attendees may shift relative to UTC. The platform should clarify that the class will follow a specific zone’s shift. There’s potential for one session effectively skipping or duplicating an hour. We need to handle this by either scheduling in absolute times (with zone) and communicating it, or possibly avoiding scheduling classes precisely during the switchover hour.
- **Teacher in Different Time Zone than Students:** A teacher might list a class time thinking in their local zone, but platform shows to others in theirs. Edge: Teacher in GMT schedules 5 PM GMT, a US parent sees it as noon EST, enrolls. If teacher somehow miscommunicates time in class description or gets confused, could be an issue. We should train teachers and/or clearly label times with time zone for them too, to avoid misalignment.
- **Low Enrollment & Cancelation:** If a class doesn’t get enough students by a certain time, a teacher might cancel or reschedule it. The platform needs to handle cancellations gracefully – notify enrolled students, possibly automatically issue credit refunds, and maybe suggest alternative classes. Cancellation is a schedule change, albeit a removal.
- **Too Many Options (Analysis Paralysis):** Having flexible scheduling means many classes and times – some users might be overwhelmed by choices. This is more a UX challenge: we might need to highlight recommended times or default to something (like showing the next available session). Over time, AI could suggest “You usually take classes at 5 PM, here are some then.”
- **Cross-schedule Dependencies:** If a student is enrolled in back-to-back classes (say one ends at 4 PM, another starts at 4 PM), technically that’s a conflict even though times don’t overlap – no travel time needed online, but the student can’t instantaneously switch contexts. We might not prevent this, but it’s an edge case where user should be mindful (maybe a warning: “You have classes back-to-back”).
- **Spanning Midnight:** For global, a class might start on one day and for someone else it’s the next day (e.g., a class at 11 PM Saturday for the teacher might be 7 AM Sunday for a student). The system must handle date differences properly in display and not confuse “tomorrow vs today”.
- **Rescheduling Recurrences:** If an ongoing class changes time permanently, ensure all future sessions update. Edge: teacher moves a weekly meeting time; the system must update the series in all enrolled calendars and not just one. Conversely, if just one occurrence is rescheduled (e.g., next week only we meet an hour later), that should not permanently shift the schedule beyond that week. Handling one-time vs permanent changes is a nuance.
- **User Forgetting Time Zone in Communication:** A parent might message a teacher “Can we meet at 5?” meaning their 5, teacher thinks their 5, which differ. The platform could mitigate by offering to use a scheduled meeting proposal tool instead of free-text for such things, or reminding “specify time zone”. It’s partly user education, but something to note if confusion cases arise.

### Dependencies and Integrations

- **Calendar System:** The platform likely needs an internal calendar system to manage all class and session times. It might integrate with external calendar APIs for user convenience (Google Calendar, Outlook integration to push events).
- **World Clock / Time Zone DB:** Use a reliable time zone database (like IANA tz database) and libraries (moment.js, etc. or built-in services) to convert and display times accurately. This needs updating as time zone rules change in various countries.
- **Notification Service:** Integration with email/SMS/push to send timely alerts about classes starting soon, schedule changes, etc. Possibly use cron jobs or scheduling services to trigger reminders X minutes before class.
- **Database Fields for Availability:** For filtering by time, classes should have structured schedule data – likely stored as datetime for each session. Also tutor availability slots perhaps as separate records. Efficient querying might need indexing by hour or separate tables. Integration with search (if using search engine) might require feeding schedule info.
- **Integration with Video/Session Management:** The scheduling system should tie into the video class creation (for instance, generating unique meeting URLs for each session). If we integrate with Zoom, for each scheduled class session we might create a Zoom meeting via their API. So, scheduling feature triggers that integration.
- **Analytics/Monitoring:** We might integrate with analytics to track peak usage times. This helps planning (like if many classes are at 7 PM, ensure servers can handle it). Also monitor if any notifications fail (e.g., bounce emails) with an integration to an email delivery report.
- **Concierge/AI Assistant:** Possibly integrate with an AI scheduling assistant as a future enhancement – e.g., a chatbot that can help find classes when user types “I need something on Thursday afternoons”. That would tie into search and scheduling.
- **External APIs for Flex content:** If offering flex classes, integration with content hosting (maybe embed videos or use a LMS-like system to drip content weekly). Not exactly scheduling but related to flexible format.

### Priority Level

**Priority:** Must Have.
_Rationale:_ Flexibility is a core promise of online learning platforms and was explicitly requested. If classes were only at fixed times without variety, many potential users would be excluded. Flexible scheduling greatly enhances user experience and reach (e.g., homeschoolers vs after-school users vs international users all need different timing). For the platform to scale and serve a global audience, this is essential. It’s also tied to other must-haves like Global Access and Homeschool-friendliness. Thus, the platform should launch with at least basic flexible scheduling (multiple class times, time zone support, filters). Some sub-features like flex classes or very advanced conflict management could be “Nice to Have” at launch, but overall, the ability to find and schedule classes flexibly is a must-have feature.

### Metrics/KPIs to Measure Success

- **Class Fill Across Times:** We should see enrollment distribution across various time slots. A success indicator would be that classes offered at non-peak times (e.g., mid-day or late night) still get enrollments, indicating we successfully matched those times to the right audiences (like homeschoolers or international). Track enrollment by time-of-day and region to ensure we’re meeting needs globally.
- **Utilization of Filters:** How many users use the time/day filter or calendar view in search. If a significant percentage does, it shows that feature is valued. If not, maybe they aren’t finding it or don’t need it (or we already show them what they need without filter). But likely, heavy use indicates our audience does find scheduling important.
- **Average Time to First Class:** From sign-up to attending a first class, how long on average? If we offer many schedule options, ideally a new user can find a class starting soon that fits their schedule (maybe same day or next day). Shorter time to first class suggests our schedule flexibility is working to immediately engage users.
- **Repeat Usage Due to Flexibility:** If a user has to leave because schedule changed (e.g., soccer season started), do they find new classes at a different time? A metric: how many users shift the timing of their classes rather than churn. E.g., a user did a Monday class for summer, then in fall does a Saturday class. High retention by switching schedule indicates flexibility meeting their changing needs.
- **No-Show/Drop Rate:** Are scheduling conflicts causing no-shows or drop-outs? Monitor class attendance vs enrollment. If a user misses multiple classes due to schedule issues, they might drop. Ideally, flexibility reduces no-shows (because they could reschedule or find times that truly fit). If we see a trend of people dropping classes because of timing, that’s an area to improve (maybe need more time options or better reminders).
- **Global Participation:** Track growth in users from various time zones and if classes are available to them. For example, measure how many classes are offered in UTC-friendly times for Europe, Asia, etc., and the enrollment from those regions. If global user numbers increase and they have good engagement, it shows our scheduling and time zone handling are effective.
- **Teacher Utilization:** Are teachers able to fill multiple time slots? If a teacher offers two sections at different times, do both fill reasonably? If yes, it means offering flexible times increased total enrollments. We might compare teachers who offer multiple times vs single time – likely those with multiple times serve more total students, which indicates success of flexibility approach.

### Competitive/Market Benchmarking

Competitors in the online learning space often emphasize flexibility as a key benefit over traditional classes. **Outschool**, for instance, highlights that they have classes at various times and even offers “Flex” classes (which are asynchronous) specifically to cater to scheduling needs. Traditional tutoring companies also allow scheduling at the convenience of the student, some even 24/7 if international tutors are available. Our platform should aim to match or exceed these standards. A specific benchmark: Outschool’s membership plans mention “flexible class credits” and the ability to use them for any class schedule. Also, platforms like **Coursera** (for older learners) tout “learn on your own schedule” with self-paced courses; while we are focused on live sessions, offering some asynchronous options keeps us competitive on flexibility. To stay ahead, our platform could highlight features such as: global round-the-clock class availability (some competitor might not explicitly ensure classes for all time zones), easy switching between class times or makeup sessions (some smaller platforms have rigid schedules). Homeschool-centric platforms often schedule during the day; afterschool ones in the evening – by catering to both, we cover a broader market. Additionally, providing a user-friendly scheduling interface can set us apart; if competitors have clunky scheduling (for example, some require contacting customer support to reschedule), our self-service tools would be a plus. In summary, benchmarking suggests that being **“schedule-friendly”** is expected; our edge will be in how seamless and broad our scheduling options are, truly letting users “set learning free” on their terms.

## Feature 5: Real, Vetted Teachers

### Feature Overview and Description

A crucial element of the platform is that all classes and tutoring sessions are led by **real, vetted teachers** – meaning qualified humans (not just pre-recorded videos or unverified individuals) who have been screened for quality and safety. “Vetted” implies that the platform has a thorough process to ensure each educator’s identity, background, and competence have been checked and approved before they can teach. This addresses parents’ concerns about safety (no dangerous individuals around their kids), credibility (teachers who know their subject and how to teach), and accountability (teachers are real people the platform stands behind, not anonymous). The vetting process typically includes identity verification, criminal background checks, and evaluation of teaching experience or subject expertise. It might also involve an application process where teachers submit credentials or demo lessons. By marketing “real, vetted teachers,” the platform builds trust that the instructors are not only knowledgeable but also trustworthy and child-friendly. This feature will also encompass **teacher profiles with credentials**, so parents and students can see who the teacher is (with a bio, photo, qualifications, reviews). It aligns with creating a safe and high-quality learning environment. Essentially, unlike some open platforms where anyone can sign up to teach without checks, our platform commits that every educator has passed certain standards – for instance, **“all approved educators must complete identity verification and a criminal background check before they can teach”**. This rigorous vetting will be a cornerstone of our brand’s reliability.

### User Personas and Use Cases

- **Cautious Parent:** A parent of two (ages 8 and 12) is very concerned about online safety. Before enrolling her children in classes, she checks the teachers’ profiles for credentials and sees a note that all teachers are background-checked. She finds that reassuring. For example, she enrolls in a history class because the teacher is a certified teacher with 10 years of classroom experience, according to their profile. Knowing the platform vetted the teacher, she feels comfortable letting her child attend unsupervised.
- **Learner Seeking Expert:** A high school student looking for advanced calculus help wants a tutor who really knows their stuff. He filters or searches for tutors with certain qualifications (like a Master’s in Math or teaching experience). He finds a tutor who is a former math professor. The vetting process ensured the tutor’s credentials were verified. The student is confident that this “real teacher” can effectively help him, as opposed to just finding a random person online.
- **New Teacher Applicant – “Ms. Smith”:** An experienced educator (with a teaching credential and 5 years of middle school teaching) decides to join the platform to teach science classes. She goes through the vetting process: provides her ID for verification, consents to a background check (which the platform runs), and submits a sample class outline for quality review. Once approved, she gets a badge on her profile indicating she’s a verified teacher. She appreciates that the platform maintains high standards because it means she’s in a professional community of educators and parents will respect her qualifications.
- **Platform Safety Officer (internal persona):** The Trust & Safety team member uses the vetting system to review teacher applications. They ensure background check reports are clear and that teachers understand the platform’s code of conduct. When any issue arises (like a complaint about a teacher), they refer back to the vetting info and possibly re-screen if needed. This persona’s use case ensures the process is thorough and ongoing (annual checks, etc.).
- **Returning User influenced by Teacher:** A student took a great class from a certain teacher. Because the teacher was clearly skilled and vetted, the parent now specifically looks for other classes by that teacher or others with similar credentials. The platform fosters such loyalty by highlighting teachers’ expertise and track record.

### Detailed Functional Requirements

- **Teacher Application Workflow:** Implement an onboarding flow for educators that includes: filling personal info, uploading identification, consenting to background check, providing qualifications (resume, certificates, or self-description of experience), and possibly a demo video or sample lesson plan for review. The system should track the status of each application (e.g., Pending ID verification, Background Check in progress, Demo Review pending, Approved).
- **Background Checks Integration:** Integrate with a background check service (e.g., Checkr or similar) via API to run criminal background checks for each teacher applicant. The platform should securely transmit necessary data and receive a pass/fail or report. Criteria for disqualification should be set (e.g., violent or sexual offenses should disqualify). Completed checks should be stored (at least a flag that it passed and date). Also, plan for **annual re-checks** as some platforms do.
- **Identity Verification:** Ensure each teacher’s identity is verified, e.g., through ID document upload and perhaps a selfie comparison or live verification. This prevents fake identities. Mark profiles as identity-verified.
- **Qualifications Verification (if applicable):** If we promise “real teachers,” some may expect actual teaching credentials. While we might accept subject experts without a formal teaching degree, we should at least vet that they have the knowledge (maybe through interviews or requiring references). The system could allow uploading of certificates (like teaching license, degrees) and perhaps have staff verify those. Verified qualifications can be indicated on profiles (like a badge for “Certified Teacher” if they have state cert, etc.).
- **Content & Teaching Quality Review:** Apart from safety, vetting includes checking that the teacher can teach well. Before first class, require either a video introduction or a mock class that a reviewer checks for communication skills and appropriateness. Alternatively, closely monitor their first few classes (collect feedback) before fully endorsing them. The platform might have a probationary period where new teachers get extra scrutiny.
- **Teacher Profile Pages:** After approval, each teacher gets a profile visible to parents/students. It should include: a photo, bio, subjects they teach, years of experience or qualifications summary, any credentials (with icons for degrees, background check passed, etc.), and reviews from students. It should clearly show that they are vetted (perhaps a statement like “Background Check: ✅ Cleared \[date]”).
- **Ongoing Monitoring and Conduct:** Vetting isn’t just one-and-done. The system should support a **strike or report system**. If a teacher violates rules or gets serious complaints, the platform can suspend or remove them. There should be functionality for users to report a teacher after a class if something was off. The Trust & Safety team can then investigate (maybe via chat logs or requesting class recordings if available) and take action. All of this upholds the “vetted” promise by ensuring teachers continue to behave appropriately.
- **Training & Resources:** Provide new teachers with mandatory training modules about how to use the platform and maintain a safe environment. Perhaps they must read and accept guidelines (like not exchanging personal info, how to handle bullying, etc.). This ensures quality and safety awareness as part of vetting.
- **Display and Badge:** Clearly display on the site that teachers are vetted. Possibly show a badge on class listings like “Vetted Teacher” or “Background-checked” seal. Also a page describing the vetting process to reassure new users (e.g., “Our educators are carefully selected: we verify identity, run background checks, and review their qualifications.”). This marketing aspect is fed by the actual vetting data.
- **Privacy of Teacher Data:** Ensure that private data from vetting (like background check reports or personal IDs) are stored securely and not exposed to users. Only the trust team or necessary staff should access those. On profiles, we only show safe information (like first name, maybe last initial, bio). The teacher’s full legal info stays internal. This is crucial for privacy and security compliance.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** Handling sensitive personal data (IDs, background checks) means strong data security. Encrypt data at rest for uploaded documents, use secure connections for background check API. Comply with any data protection laws for storing such info (GDPR if applicable, etc.). Only authorized staff accounts can access vetting info.
- **Accuracy:** The vetting process must be accurate and consistent. That means minimal false negatives (approving someone who should not have been) and false positives (rejecting good teachers erroneously). Choosing reliable background check services and having clear criteria helps. Also ensure identity verification has high accuracy (some systems have selfie matching with AI, ensure it’s tuned well).
- **Efficiency (Throughput):** Onboarding a teacher should ideally be done in a reasonable time. Background checks may take a few days; identity verification can be near-instant with the right tools. We should aim to get most applications processed within, say, one week. The system should be able to handle many parallel applications if the platform scales (so if 1000 teachers apply in a week, the workflows and integrations can handle that volume).
- **Compliance:** If operating in multiple countries, comply with each country’s regulations on background checks and data handling. For example, some places might restrict what you can check or require the person’s consent (we will obtain consent during application). Also EEOC rules in the US about not discriminating based on certain records might apply – have a policy for what disqualifies someone that is fair and legally sound.
- **User Trust and Perception:** Non-functional but important: the vetting process and its results should instill confidence without causing undue alarm or bias. For instance, showing a teacher is “background checked and approved” is good; we avoid overly scaring users by listing all the things we screened out. Also ensure no sensitive personal info about teachers is shown to users inadvertently (like “this teacher was checked against XYZ database” – just say vetted).
- **Transparency and Fairness for Teachers:** While we want thorough vetting, we should also provide feedback or recourse. If a teacher fails vetting (e.g., something on their record), ideally the system notifies them with a generic reason (“We could not approve due to results of background check”) and maybe a way to contest if it’s an error. The application portal should show their status. This fairness will matter to prospective teachers.
- **Maintainability:** The vetting system likely involves some manual steps (human review). It should be designed such that scaling up vetting (more staff reviewers, etc.) is manageable. Possibly integrate admin dashboards for vetting that queue up tasks (review ID, review demo video) so staff can systematically approve. Make it easy to update criteria or add new checks if needed.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Background Check Pass Required:** Given a new teacher applicant completes the forms and identity verification, when their background check comes back clear, then the system marks them as eligible to teach (assuming other steps are done too) and they can start creating classes. If the background check returns flags (e.g., disqualifying offense), then their application status becomes “rejected” and they are not allowed to teach. Test: create a dummy teacher application, simulate a “pass” result and see that account gets teaching access; simulate a “fail” and see access denied with appropriate communication.
- **Profile Indicator:** When browsing classes, if a user views the teacher’s profile, then it clearly shows that the teacher is vetted. Acceptance example: On the teacher profile page, text like “Background Check: Passed \[date]” is visible. Or a shield/check icon next to their name. Also verify that unapproved users (like someone mid-vetting) cannot appear in public listings at all.
- **ID Verification Process:** Try submitting a fake or mismatched identity in application and ensure the system catches it (maybe via manual review). For acceptance, perhaps test with a scenario: applicant uploads an ID and a selfie that do not match – the reviewer or automated system should flag and not approve them. Conversely, proper matching ID leads to pass.
- **Data Handling:** Check that sensitive info is not leaking. For acceptance, a normal end-user (parent account) should not be able to see any teacher’s personal details beyond what’s intended (no access to their full name if we only show first, etc., and obviously not their ID docs or anything). Try various ways (like inspecting elements or API calls as a normal user) to ensure no leak.
- **Reporting a Teacher:** After a class, use a test user to file a report about a teacher’s conduct. The system should log this and alert the Trust & Safety team interface. Then ensure there’s a method for staff to mark outcomes (e.g., warning issued, teacher removed). Acceptance: simulate a report, handle it in admin, ensure teacher’s status updates (e.g., suspended if we choose that) and that the teacher and reporter get any necessary follow-up communication.
- **Annual Re-check:** If the policy is to re-run background checks yearly, have a mechanism in place. Acceptance could be simulated by advancing system date past a year of a teacher’s approval, then system should flag that teacher for a new check or temporarily suspend until done. This ensures ongoing vetting.
- **Quality Check on First Class:** For a new teacher, attend their first class (or get feedback from first students). The acceptance criteria might be more subjective, but for example: the system could automatically send a survey to initial students “How was your class experience?” If negative feedback arises, the teacher gets flagged for review. We can test that such a survey triggers and any negative response flows to staff for follow-up.
- **Teacher Application Experience:** A teacher can go through the whole application and approval process without confusion. For acceptance, perhaps run a user test: a person tries to sign up as teacher, goes through each step – is it clear and did they receive notifications (like “background check in progress, you’ll hear back in X days”)? And once approved, did they get a welcome email? These ensure the process is smooth.

### User Stories

- **As a parent**, I want to know that the teachers on the platform are trustworthy and qualified, so that I can confidently let my child interact with them online and know they are in good hands.
- **As a student**, I want teachers who really know the subject and can teach well, so that my time isn’t wasted and I learn effectively from an expert rather than someone who might be unprepared.
- **As a teacher applicant**, I want to easily understand and complete the vetting process, so that I can start teaching on the platform and I know that having passed the checks will make me more credible to families.
- **As an operations manager**, I want a reliable system for vetting all instructors (background checks, verifications, etc.), so that we maintain a high standard of safety and quality, and avoid any incidents that could harm students or the platform’s reputation.
- **As a quality assurance specialist**, I want to ensure that every class is led by a capable educator, so that customer satisfaction remains high and the platform’s educational value is evident in all offerings. (This might involve reviewing content or initial classes as part of vetting).

### Edge Cases and Constraints

- **Background Check Limitations:** Some international teachers or those outside covered regions might be hard to check (e.g., check services may not cover all countries thoroughly). Edge: a teacher from a country where we can’t easily get a criminal report – do we allow them? Possibly require alternative documentation (like a police clearance certificate) manually. Need a policy for that or restrict to certain countries initially.
- **False Alarms:** A background check might flag something minor or old (e.g., a decades-old misdemeanor). We should have a nuanced approach (maybe case-by-case review) rather than auto-reject everything. Also, records mistakes can happen (someone else’s record mismatched). We should allow an appeal process or secondary verification to handle such cases fairly.
- **Privacy vs Assurance:** Some parents might ask for even more info on teachers (like full name or a copy of credentials). We have to balance privacy. We likely won’t provide copies of degrees to users, but might verify internally. Edge: a user requests to see a teacher’s teaching license – we might just have to say it’s verified by us, not share the document.
- **Scalability of Manual Review:** If the platform grows, manually evaluating every teacher’s teaching ability might become a bottleneck. We might need to streamline or focus on key aspects (like rely on first few class reviews by users as the test). Over time, if thousands of teachers join, automation or community feedback might supplement vetting.
- **Potential for Bias:** Vetting processes must be careful not to unintentionally bias against certain groups. E.g., requiring certain credentials might exclude talented informal educators; background check disparities could reflect systemic biases. We must regularly review our criteria to ensure we allow diverse educators while maintaining safety.
- **Teacher Turnover:** If a teacher passes vetting but later something changes (e.g., they commit a crime after joining), the annual checks or user reports are the only way to catch that. There’s a gap. We should possibly do periodic checks or have alerts (some services provide updates if a new offense is detected, etc.). It’s an edge scenario but important for continued safety.
- **External Experts vs Certified Teachers:** Our platform likely welcomes subject experts who might not be certified teachers (like a professional coder teaching coding). Vetting such people focuses on background and subject knowledge. Edge: a parent might assume “vetted teacher” means certified teacher. We should clarify wording (“vetted instructor”) if needed. But overall, ensure the vetting covers both traditional and non-traditional teacher backgrounds adequately.
- **Impostor Risk:** Although we verify identity once, theoretically someone else could attempt to teach using a vetted teacher’s account (e.g., a friend or spouse). While that’s hard to police, occasional identity re-checks or monitoring teaching style might catch if something’s off. Or have teacher occasionally confirm identity via 2-factor or such. This is an extreme edge case.
- **Teacher Diversity in Vetting:** Ensure our vetting process doesn’t inadvertently filter out diversity (for example, requiring a certain style of demo could be subjective). We want a **diverse set of teachers** (ties into Feature 18) while still upholding standards. So vetting criteria should be culturally sensitive and inclusive.

### Dependencies and Integrations

- **Background Check Service:** As mentioned, integration with third-party checks (like Checkr for US, or another for international). Possibly multiple services depending on region. Maintain those API keys and handle billing for checks.
- **Identity Verification Tech:** Use services like Onfido or Veriff for ID and selfie checks, or build an in-house with OCR. This dependency should be reliable in scanning various ID types worldwide.
- **Database for Teacher Info:** A secure database or separate store for sensitive teacher data (could be separate from main user DB for security). Ensure encryption and proper access controls.
- **CRM/Admin Interface:** Integration for staff to review and communicate with teacher applicants. Possibly tie into our support ticket system or CRM so staff can manage communications (like asking a teacher for more info or informing them of approval).
- **Notification/Email System:** To inform teachers of their application status, to remind about re-checks, or training completion. Integration with email templates, etc.
- **Legal/Policy Documentation:** Tie in with our legal content – Terms of Service should mention background checks and teacher obligations, privacy policy covers data use. We may need an integration to have teachers sign certain agreements (like code of conduct, maybe a contract).
- **Analytics:** Track metrics on teacher quality: average ratings per teacher, any correlation with vetting data (for internal improvement). Also track conversion of teacher applicants to approved, to identify if our funnel is too strict or too lenient.
- **Certification Verification (if any):** If we decide to verify some licenses or degrees manually or via databases, integrate that (maybe not initially; could just collect docs). For example, some states have public teacher license lookup, but that’s too complex to integrate broadly, likely manual.

### Priority Level

**Priority:** Must Have.
_Rationale:_ Ensuring teachers are vetted is critical for an education platform dealing with minors. Parents will not trust the platform otherwise. It’s both a safety requirement (to prevent harm) and a quality requirement (to ensure good learning experiences). The user’s list explicitly calls out “Real, Vetted Teachers,” highlighting it as a top feature. This likely means from day one, every teacher on the platform should go through at least basic vetting (ID and background check). You cannot retroactively add this easily without potential incidents, so it must be in place from the start. It underpins many other features (Safe Environment, Teacher Diversity, etc.). Thus, it’s absolutely a must-have foundational feature at launch.

### Metrics/KPIs to Measure Success

- **Percentage of Teachers Vetted (100%):** This is binary in a sense – we need 100% of active teachers to have completed the vetting steps. We can track compliance (if any teachers slip through unvetted due to a bug, that’s a critical issue).
- **Teacher Approval Rate:** Out of all teacher applicants, how many get approved vs rejected, and time to approval. If we see, for instance, 95% approval, maybe we’re either attracting only qualified folks or our bar is low; if only 50% are approved, maybe bar is high or many unqualified apply. Monitoring this helps calibrate recruiting and vetting criteria.
- **Incident Rate:** The number of safety incidents or serious complaints involving teachers (like misconduct) per number of classes taught. We aim for zero tolerance on severe issues. If vetting is effective and combined with monitoring, this should be extremely low (target 0 major incidents). Any incident that does occur should prompt review of vetting gaps.
- **Parent Trust Feedback:** Measure parent confidence in teachers via surveys or NPS. For example, ask parents “Do you feel the platform’s teachers are qualified and trustworthy?” If a high percentage strongly agree, that indicates our vetting and portrayal of it are successful. Parent reviews of classes often mention the teacher – track the average teacher rating platform-wide (should be high if vetting ensures quality).
- **Teacher Retention and Quality:** Track how vetted teachers perform over time. For example, average class ratings in their first month vs third month – good vetting/training should mean they start strong. If a lot of teachers have poor ratings early, maybe vetting didn’t weed out some quality issues. We could set a KPI like “80% of new teachers maintain an average rating of 4.0 or above in their first 3 months”.
- **Time to Vetting Completion:** The average time from a teacher applying to being fully approved and teaching. Shorter is better (with thoroughness intact) to grow supply. We might aim e.g. median 5 days. Monitoring this ensures the process is efficient and we have enough resources in trust team.
- **Diversity of Teachers:** Although not directly about vetting, one outcome metric – are we approving a diverse pool of teachers (in terms of location, background)? We can track teacher demographics (to the extent collected) to ensure our vetting isn’t skewing the pool inadvertently. This ties into Feature 18 KPIs as well.

### Competitive/Market Benchmarking

Most reputable education platforms highlight their teacher vetting process. **Outschool**, for instance, requires identity verification and background checks for all educators and manually reviews every class content to ensure quality. They publicly answer “Yes, all teachers are background checked” in their FAQs. **Varsity Tutors** and similar tutoring companies often brag about their rigorous tutor screening (subject tests, interviews). We should be comparable or better: e.g., in addition to background checks, perhaps we emphasize that many of our teachers are certified teachers or professionals in their field. A competitive edge might be our transparency – perhaps providing more info on teacher profiles than some competitors, and our commitment to ongoing quality (not just one-time vetting). Some newer platforms might shortcut vetting to scale quickly, but that can lead to issues; we should not compromise here. Also, by having vetted teachers, we differentiate from free or cheap services (like random folks on YouTube or unmoderated marketplaces) by offering a safer, higher-quality experience, which justifies our value. In summary, our vetting process should meet or exceed the standard set by top competitors, and we should communicate it clearly to users as a trust signal. For example, mention that we “review the background of every educator and the content of every class before they are offered” as Outschool does – and ensure we actually do that. This will position us as a **trusted platform with high-caliber educators**, which is essential in the education market.
