## Introduction

Modern web applications demand not only rich features and performance but also top-notch security from end to end. **ReactJS** with **TypeScript** is a powerful combination for building robust user interfaces, but without careful attention, critical security flaws can creep in. In fact, studies show that **83%** of applications have at least one security flaw in the initial scan, and 2 out of 3 applications fail to pass the OWASP Top 10 tests ([React Security Vulnerabilities that you should never ignore! | Simform](https://www.simform.com/blog/react-security-vulnerabilities-solutions/#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20the%20majority%20of,top%2025%20security%20flaw%20test)). As an advanced developer, you need to ensure your React app **does not become part of these statistics**.

This comprehensive guide serves as a step-by-step journey through building a **secure ReactJS application** using TypeScript, with a focus on eliminating the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. We will cover everything from initial project setup to deployment and incident response, highlighting best practices, code examples, and checklists along the way. By following these guidelines, you will learn how to:

- Configure your project (Webpack, Babel, etc.) securely from the start.
- Develop React components and manage state with security in mind.
- Implement authentication (OAuth2, JWT) and authorization (RBAC, feature flags) safely.
- Communicate with back-end APIs (REST/GraphQL) over secure channels with proper headers, CORS, and CSRF protections.
- Handle data and user input to prevent XSS, injection, and sensitive data exposure.
- Integrate security testing into your development pipeline (SAST/DAST, dependency scanning).
- Deploy to cloud platforms (AWS, Vercel, Netlify, etc.) with hardened configurations, and monitor for threats in production.

Each section provides detailed explanations, relevant code snippets in **TypeScript/JSX**, and practical tips. We also include **security checklists** at the end of each major section so you can verify nothing was missed. The advice herein aligns with OWASP recommendations and industry best practices, ensuring your application remains resilient against common vulnerabilities.

> **NOTE:** This guide assumes you are comfortable with React and TypeScript fundamentals. The focus is on **security techniques** rather than basic React syntax. Also, while we emphasize front-end security, remember that true application security requires coordination with backend systems. We will mention backend concerns (like SQL injection or server-side validation) when relevant, but always ensure your server-side is equally hardened.

Let’s dive in and start with setting up a secure foundation for your project.

---

## 1. Project Setup & Configuration

Security must be considered from the very beginning of your project. A secure React application starts with a secure project setup: choosing safe dependencies, locking down configurations, and organizing your codebase in a way that reduces risk. In this section, we will:

- Set up secure dependency management (to avoid known vulnerable packages or malicious imports).
- Configure build tools (Webpack, Babel) for security (preventing leaks, using production settings).
- Manage environment variables and app settings without exposing secrets.

By the end of this section, you will have a project skeleton that **minimizes attack surface** and is primed for secure development.

### 1.1 Secure Package Management

Modern JavaScript apps rely heavily on third-party packages from npm (or Yarn). Managing these packages securely is crucial because using a package with known vulnerabilities or malicious code can put your entire app at risk (OWASP Top 10 category: _Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities_). Here are best practices for secure package management:

- **Lock Dependency Versions**: Use a _lockfile_ (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) and check it into version control. This ensures that the exact versions you tested are used in production, preventing an updated dependency from introducing a new vulnerability unexpectedly.
- **Prefer Well-Maintained Libraries**: Choose popular, actively maintained packages for critical functionality. Check the repository activity, open security issues, and update frequency. Avoid packages that are deprecated or unmaintained.
- **Avoid Typosquatting**: Only install packages with correct, verified names. Be cautious of similarly named packages that might be malware. For example, `react-scripts` is official, but a typo like `react-sripcs` (if it existed) could be malicious. Double-check package names and sources.
- **Minimize Dependencies**: Every dependency is a potential risk. Include only what you truly need. For instance, if a utility function can be written in a few lines, consider implementing it yourself rather than pulling in a new library. Fewer dependencies reduce the surface for _vulnerable/outdated components_ (OWASP A06:2021).
- **Regularly Update Packages**: Outdated packages might have security flaws. Use `npm outdated` to list available updates and upgrade frequently, especially when security patches are released. Automate this with tools like **Dependabot** or **Renovate** which alert you and can even open PRs for updates.
- **Audit for Vulnerabilities**: Integrate `npm audit` (or `yarn audit`) into your workflow. This command checks your dependency tree against known vulnerability databases and reports issues. For deeper scans, consider using **Snyk**, **OWASP Dependency-Check**, or GitHub Security Alerts. Address reported vulnerabilities by updating or patching packages.
- **Verify Package Integrity**: npm automatically verifies package integrity via SHA-512 hashes in the lockfile. Ensure your team does not bypass this. If you host a private registry or proxy, ensure it's secure. Additionally, be cautious with packages that have post-install scripts (they can run arbitrary code on your machine during installation). Only allow those from trusted publishers.
- **Scoped Access (for internal packages)**: If you create internal packages (on a private npm registry or GitHub Package Registry), use scoped packages (`@yourorg/package`) and require authentication to install. This prevents unauthorized access and tampering.

**Example: Using npm audit (CI Integration)**  
You can add a script in `package.json` to run `npm audit` and fail the build if high severity issues are found:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "audit": "npm audit --audit-level=high"
  }
}
```

Then in CI, run `npm run audit`. Alternatively, use a dedicated GitHub Action or Snyk integration to break the build on known vulnerabilities.

### 1.2 Webpack and Babel Configuration

**Webpack** is the most common bundler for React apps (Create React App uses it under the hood). A secure Webpack configuration ensures that your build output is optimized for security and performance. Likewise, **Babel** transforms your code – its settings can also impact security (for example, polyfills or proposals you enable).

Key considerations for Webpack:

- **Mode and Optimizations**: Always set `mode` to `"production"` for production builds. This enables optimizations and removes development-only code. In production mode, React automatically strips helpful but verbose warnings that could potentially hint at internal logic or expose stack traces. Example:
  ```js
  // webpack.config.js
  module.exports = {
    mode: "production",
    // ...other settings
  };
  ```
  This also minifies the code, making it harder for attackers to read logic (not a primary security measure, but it reduces casual snooping).
- **Devtool (Source Maps)**: Source maps are useful for debugging but can expose your source code and comments. In production, either disable source maps or use a secure option:
  - Disable: `devtool: false` (no source map generated).
  - OR use `devtool: 'source-map'` but **do not deploy** the source map file to the public (keep it in your error tracking system or protected storage). If using services like Sentry for error tracking, you can upload source maps to them and not expose publicly.
  - Alternatively, `devtool: 'hidden-source-map'` (Webpack will generate source maps without adding the reference comment in files, so users can't easily find them).
- **DefinePlugin for Environment Variables**: Use `webpack.DefinePlugin` to inject environment variables at build time in a controlled way. Only expose non-sensitive vars. For example:
  ```js
  new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    "process.env.API_URL": JSON.stringify(process.env.API_URL),
    "process.env.NODE_ENV": JSON.stringify("production"),
  });
  ```
  This ensures `process.env.NODE_ENV` is set to "production" in React (so it runs in production mode internally).
- **Avoiding Eval**: Webpack’s default in production doesn’t use `eval`, but in development it might (for fast rebuilds). Ensure no eval is used in production, as eval can be a vector for code injection. Set `devtool` appropriately to avoid any eval-based source map (e.g., avoid `eval-source-map` in production).
- **Content Security Policy (CSP) compatibility**: If you plan to use a strict Content Security Policy (discussed later), configure Webpack to avoid injecting any inline scripts that violate CSP. For instance, if using Webpack’s script loader or style loader, avoid options that create inline scripts/styles on the fly in production.
- **Output Filenames**: Use hash in filenames for cache busting (e.g., `bundle.[contenthash].js`). This is a performance measure but also can help in incident response – if a file is compromised, you can release a new bundle with a new hash ensuring users load the updated file.
- **Exclude Development Tools**: Ensure you don’t accidentally bundle development utilities. For example, if you used something like React Developer Tools or Redux DevTools extension support, strip it out in production. Many libraries handle this via `process.env.NODE_ENV` check. By setting the environment properly, unused dev-only code will be dropped.

Babel considerations:

- **Preset Config**: Use official presets (like `@babel/preset-env` and `@babel/preset-react`) which are well-maintained. Avoid overly experimental plugins in production unless necessary, as they could introduce instability. If you do use proposals, ensure they are at Stage 4 (finished) or well understood.
- **Polyfills and CoreJS**: If you use older browser support with core-js polyfills, keep them updated. Outdated polyfills (like an old core-js) could have known issues. Babel’s `useBuiltIns: "usage"` with core-js is a good approach to include only needed polyfills.
- **Transform Runtime**: Use `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` to avoid polluting global scope and to reuse Babel helper code. Not directly a security issue, but it reduces conflicts that could lead to weird bugs.
- **Remove Console Logs**: As a minor hardening step, consider using Babel or Webpack plugins to remove `console.log` and `debugger` statements in production. This ensures internal messages (which might accidentally include sensitive info) don’t show up in the browser console. For example, `babel-plugin-transform-remove-console` can strip console calls. Use it carefully (you might keep console.error/warn).
- **Linting in Build**: While not Babel, it's related: you can integrate ESLint in the build process (via `eslint-webpack-plugin`) to catch insecure code patterns before the app even runs (more on specific rules in Section 6).

**Example: Minimal secure Webpack config snippet**  
Below is a simplified example of a Webpack configuration geared for a secure production build:

```js
// webpack.config.js (for production)
const path = require("path");
const webpack = require("webpack");
module.exports = {
  mode: "production",
  entry: "./src/index.tsx",
  output: {
    filename: "[name].[contenthash].js", // content-hashed for cache busting
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    clean: true, // clean old files out of dist on build
  },
  devtool: "hidden-source-map", // generate source maps without exposing them
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".js", ".ts", ".tsx"], // resolve TS/TSX
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        use: "babel-loader",
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
      // ... (loaders for CSS, images, etc.)
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      "process.env.NODE_ENV": JSON.stringify("production"),
      "process.env.API_URL": JSON.stringify(process.env.API_URL), // example
    }),
    // ... (you can add TerserPlugin for more minification if not already in prod mode)
  ],
};
```

This config sets production mode, uses content hashes for output files, includes .tsx in resolving, and injects environment variables. It expects that you have your environment variable `API_URL` defined in your build environment (not containing secrets, just configuration).

### 1.3 Environment Variables and Secure Configurations

React applications often use environment variables for configuration (for example, API endpoints, feature toggles, etc.). In a Create React App or Vite setup, these variables (like `REACT_APP_API_URL`) are embedded at build time. It's critical to understand that **any environment variable used in a React app will become part of the client-side bundle** – and thus visible to the end user. There is **no secure way to hide a secret in a front-end-only application** ([webpack - How Secure are Environment Variables in REACTJS that using .env in the root of project? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74310818/how-secure-are-environment-variables-in-reactjs-that-using-env-in-the-root-of-p#:~:text=If%20the%20application%20runs%20on,the%20response%20to%20the%20client)). If the app needs it to function, the user can find it by inspecting the code or network calls. Therefore:

- **Never expose secrets**: Do not put secrets like database passwords, API private keys, or any sensitive credentials in your front-end env variables. For example, a payment gateway secret key should reside on the server (your server can generate tokens or interact with the gateway), not in the React app. _“The only way to keep something secret from the client is to never send it to them”_ ([webpack - How Secure are Environment Variables in REACTJS that using .env in the root of project? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74310818/how-secure-are-environment-variables-in-reactjs-that-using-env-in-the-root-of-p#:~:text=If%20the%20application%20runs%20on,the%20response%20to%20the%20client)).
- **Use .env files carefully**: It’s fine to use a `.env` file for local development convenience (e.g., defining `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`), but ensure:
  - You add `.env` to **.gitignore** so it’s not checked into source control (to avoid accidentally leaking values).
  - For production, set environment variables via your build pipeline or hosting service (e.g., Vercel/Netlify have UI or CLI to set env vars). This way, they don’t live in code repos.
- **Prefix in Create React App**: If using CRA, remember only variables prefixed with `REACT_APP_` are picked up. This is a safety mechanism to avoid leaking other env vars unintentionally. E.g., `REACT_APP_API_URL` will be included, but an AWS_SECRET_KEY without the prefix would not (and should not be present at all in front-end).
- **Alternate Config Methods**: If you have a lot of config or need runtime flexibility, consider having the app fetch a configuration from a secure endpoint when it loads (this endpoint can be protected or only serve non-sensitive config). This is more complex but can allow changing certain settings without rebuild. Just remember, any config delivered to client is still visible to an attacker, so only non-sensitive config should be delivered.
- **Example**: API Base URL and Feature Flags. It’s common to configure an API base URL for different environments:

  ```env
  // .env.development
  REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

  // .env.production
  REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.yourapp.com/v1
  REACT_APP_NEW_FEATURE=false
  ```

  In code:

  ```tsx
  const apiBase = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;
  const newFeatureEnabled = process.env.REACT_APP_NEW_FEATURE === "true";
  ```

  This is fine because these values are not secrets, just configuration. But if you put `REACT_APP_API_KEY=someSecretKey`, that `someSecretKey` will be in the JS bundle. As one StackOverflow answer notes, using env vars this way **does not truly secure data; it just keeps it out of source code** ([webpack - How Secure are Environment Variables in REACTJS that using .env in the root of project? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74310818/how-secure-are-environment-variables-in-reactjs-that-using-env-in-the-root-of-p#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20significant%20security,the%20browser%20just%20so%20understand)). Users can still find it by inspecting your deployed app.

- **Securely handle API keys**: If your app needs an API key for a third-party service (e.g., Google Maps), treat it as public knowledge (since it’s in the app). Restrict its usage on the third-party side (e.g., restrict the key to specific domain or referrer, so it can’t be abused elsewhere). This way, even if someone finds your Google Maps API key, they cannot use it on unauthorized domains.
- **Multiple Environments**: Use separate environment variable files for dev, test, staging, prod, etc., to keep configurations isolated. Many hosting providers allow a separate set of variables per environment or branch. This also reduces risk of accidentally using a dev key in prod or vice versa.
- **Example: Next.js or Vite**: If using Next.js, environment variables can be marked as server-only or exposed to client by prefixing with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Similarly in Vite, use `VITE_` prefix. The concept is the same as CRA: clearly mark anything that can go to frontend.

### 1.4 Checklist: Secure Project Setup

Before moving to actual development, verify the following checklist for your project setup:

- [x] **Dependencies audited**: All npm packages are vetted for trust and have no known vulnerabilities (run `npm audit`). Unneeded packages removed.
- [x] **Lockfile in use**: `package-lock.json`/`yarn.lock` is present and up-to-date to prevent drift.
- [x] **Webpack in production mode**: Production builds use `mode: "production"` and no dev-only code or evals are included.
- [x] **Source maps safe**: Source maps are either not published or are uploaded securely (e.g., to Sentry) and not accessible publicly.
- [x] **Env secrets excluded**: No secret keys or passwords are in client-side environment variables. .env files are gitignored.
- [x] **Proper env per environment**: Dev and prod configs are separate; production uses production API endpoints and settings.
- [x] **Build output hardened**: Console/debug statements stripped or minimized; output files hashed; no excessive information in comments or global vars.
- [x] **Third-party keys restricted**: Any API keys used on the frontend are restricted on the provider side (by domain or quota).

With a secure foundation in place, we can proceed to development, where we will continuously apply security principles as we write our React components and manage application state.

## 2. Secure UI Development

Secure coding practices in the UI layer are essential to avoid introducing vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or inadvertent data leaks. React and TypeScript give us tools to write robust, type-safe code, but it's up to the developer to use them correctly. In this section, we'll cover:

- Leveraging TypeScript to catch errors and enforce safer interfaces.
- Structuring components and state management in a secure, maintainable way.
- Avoiding common front-end security pitfalls like XSS, unsafe DOM manipulation, and injection.

By following these practices, you'll reduce the risk of vulnerabilities during the implementation of your application’s user interface.

### 2.1 Using TypeScript for Type Safety

TypeScript adds a strong type system on top of JavaScript, which can prevent numerous bugs and some security issues. While TypeScript itself doesn't make your app immune to attacks, it helps ensure **correctness** and can catch potential issues early:

- **Enable Strict Mode**: Start your project with TypeScript's strict mode enabled (`"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`). This turns on flags like `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, etc., forcing you to handle edge cases. For example, consider a function that expects a user object with an `id: number`. If due to a bug it receives an `id: string`, it might still run and cause unintended behavior (perhaps concatenating strings instead of adding numbers). With TypeScript, such type mismatches are caught at compile time, preventing unpredictable outcomes that could be exploited.
- **Define Types for Data Structures**: Define interfaces or types for the data your app uses, especially for API responses. This ensures you know exactly what you're handling. For instance:
  ```ts
  interface User {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    role: "admin" | "user";
  }
  ```
  Then when you fetch a user, you can type the response:
  ```ts
  const user: User = await api.get<User>("/api/me");
  ```
  This way, you won't accidentally treat, say, `user.id` as a string and display it in a context expecting a string. Strong typing can prevent logic errors that might cause security issues (e.g., accidentally using an admin flag that is undefined).
- **Avoid `any`**: Using `any` excessively defeats the purpose of TS. An `any` type could hide a dangerous value. For example, `any` could let an attacker’s input flow through without checks. Try to use `unknown` for externally-received data and then narrow the type, or specific types wherever possible.
- **Use Enums or Union Types for Restricted Values**: Where applicable, use TypeScript _union types_ or `enum` to restrict possible values. For example, if a function parameter can only be `'asc'` or `'desc'` for sorting order, define it as such:
  ```ts
  type SortOrder = 'asc' | 'desc';
  function sortData(order: SortOrder) { ... }
  ```
  This prevents passing any other string, reducing errors.
- **Catch Insecure Code Patterns**: Some vulnerabilities are really logic issues. TypeScript can help catch, for instance, unhandled conditions. Consider a function that processes some data from an API:
  ```ts
  function processData(item: Item | null) {
    // do something with item.name
  }
  ```
  If `item` can be null, not handling that could cause an exception. An attacker might exploit such a bug to perform a denial of service (by causing a crash). With `strictNullChecks`, TS forces you to handle the null case:
  ```ts
  function processData(item: Item | null) {
    if (!item) return;
    // item is now guaranteed not null
    doSomething(item.name);
  }
  ```
  This makes the code more robust.
- **DOM Types and APIs**: TypeScript knows about DOM APIs. If you try to do something insecure like:

  ```ts
  (document.getElementById("input") as any).innerHTML = userInput;
  ```

  TS won't directly flag it as insecure (it's a runtime risk), but by avoiding `any` and using proper types (`HTMLElement.innerHTML` expects a string), you at least know what types you're dealing with. The next step is to remember that setting `innerHTML` can be dangerous; more on that in the XSS section.

- **Third-Party Types**: Use `@types/` packages for third-party libraries so you can catch misuse. For example, if using `dompurify` for sanitizing (to prevent XSS), installing `@types/dompurify` will help you call it with correct parameters.

In summary, TypeScript acts as a safety net. It won't automatically sanitize inputs or do security checks for you, but it will ensure that you handle data consistently and correctly, reducing the room for error. It also makes the code more self-documenting (another developer can see from types what is expected, reducing mistakes).

**Example: Catching an error with TypeScript**

```tsx
interface Account {
  id: number;
  balance: number;
}

function transferFunds(account: Account, amount: number) {
  account.balance -= amount;
}

// Suppose we mistakenly call it like:
const acct: Account = { id: 123, balance: 1000 };
transferFunds(acct, "500"); // passing a string by mistake
```

Without TypeScript, this would run and result in `NaN` (because subtracting a string yields Not-a-Number), possibly allowing an attacker to exploit the NaN state (e.g., bypassing a balance check). With TypeScript, you get a compile-time error: _Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'._ This bug is caught early, preventing a potential logic issue that could be abused.

### 2.2 Secure Component Structure & Patterns

A well-structured React component tree not only improves maintainability but can also enhance security by isolating concerns and reducing the chance of mistakes. Here are practices to follow:

- **Functional Components with Hooks**: Prefer modern functional components and React Hooks over class components when possible. Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` let you manage state and side effects more directly. This isn't inherently "more secure", but functional components encourage smaller, focused units of UI logic, which are easier to reason about and audit for security issues.
- **Separate Presentation and Logic**: Follow a component architecture where pure presentational components are separated from container (stateful) components. Presentational components receive props and display UI, with minimal logic (and certainly no direct data fetching or global state mutation). Container components handle data loading, state updates, etc. This separation means any data coming from external sources can be handled (and sanitized/validated) at the container level before reaching presentational components.
- **No Direct DOM Manipulation**: Avoid using direct DOM calls (like `document.querySelector` or jQuery) to manipulate elements. In React, you should rarely need this except maybe for certain uncontrolled inputs or focus management. Direct DOM manipulation can lead to inconsistencies and open XSS holes (e.g., inserting HTML strings). Instead, let React manage the DOM. Use refs sparingly and only for things like focusing an input or measuring size. If you do need to insert dynamic HTML, use React’s mechanisms (and see XSS section for how to do it safely).
- **Sanitize Data at Boundaries**: Whenever you take data that originated from user input or an API and bind it to the UI, consider if it needs sanitization. For example, if you're rendering a username that the user can set, it should be plain text. React will escape it by default (again, see XSS section), but if you plan to do something like render it as HTML, you must sanitize. A good pattern is to sanitize/validate at the point of data ingestion (e.g., as soon as you get a response or as soon as user input is received) and then store it in state. That way, your components can trust that state (to an extent).
- **Guarding Sensitive Components**: If you have components or parts of the UI that should only show for certain conditions (auth or role based), handle that logic clearly and high in the component tree (e.g., route level or context). For instance, an `<AdminDashboard>` component should be rendered only if `user.role === 'admin'`. We'll cover RBAC in detail later, but structurally, don't bury such checks deep inside child components where they might be overlooked.
- **Use React’s Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundary components to catch runtime errors in the component tree. While not directly a security feature, this prevents leaking error details to the user. Instead of a raw stack trace or failure (which could reveal implementation details), you can show a generic error message. You can also log the error to your monitoring system securely. Make sure the error boundary doesn’t itself expose sensitive info; just a user-friendly message and a report to the server.
- **Immutable State Updates**: Always treat state as immutable (e.g., use spread operator or `setState` correctly) rather than mutating objects. This avoids subtle bugs. For example, mutating state directly can cause React to not update a component when expected, potentially leaving stale data visible. A stale security setting on the UI due to a bug might be misleading. Using proper patterns (like Redux’s pure reducers or Immer for immutability) ensures state changes propagate as intended.
- **Size and Complexity**: Keep components small. Large, complex components are harder to test and audit. If a component does too many things (handles input, shows data, has complex DOM logic), it’s easier to inadvertently introduce a security issue. Break them down by responsibility.

**Example: Presentational vs Container Component**

```tsx
// Presentational component (secure by simplicity: just displays data)
type ProfileProps = {
  name: string;
  bio: string;
};
const UserProfile: React.FC<ProfileProps> = ({ name, bio }) => (
  <div className="profile">
    <h2>{name}</h2>
    <p>{bio}</p> {/* React auto-escapes, so bio is safe as text */}
  </div>
);
```

The above `UserProfile` just takes `name` and `bio` as props and renders them. It doesn’t care where they come from. Now a container that fetches this data:

```tsx
const UserProfileContainer: React.FC = () => {
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState<ProfileProps | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/me")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => {
        // Example sanitization: ensure bio is plain text
        data.bio = DOMPurify.sanitize(data.bio, {
          USE_PROFILES: { html: false },
        });
        setProfile({ name: data.name, bio: data.bio });
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error("Failed to load profile", err);
      });
  }, []);

  if (!profile) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  return <UserProfile name={profile.name} bio={profile.bio} />;
};
```

Here `UserProfileContainer` handles fetching and sanitizing. It uses `DOMPurify.sanitize` to strip any HTML from `bio` just in case (assuming our API might allow HTML bio but we want to neutralize any script). This way, by the time data reaches `UserProfile`, it’s safe to render. This separation makes it clear where data is trusted versus untrusted.

### 2.3 State Management (Redux, React Query) Best Practices

Large React applications often use state management libraries like **Redux** (for global state) or **React Query** (for server state caching). While these tools help structure data handling, they also require attention to security:

- **Do Not Store Secrets in State**: Avoid keeping sensitive tokens or data in Redux or any global state that is serializable. Redux state is often accessible via the Redux DevTools (in development) and could be serialized to localStorage (if using persistence). For example, storing a JWT or password in Redux makes it easily accessible to any script running on the page (e.g., if an XSS occurs, it can grab the entire state). Prefer to keep such data in memory (within a closure or React context that isn’t easily introspected) or in secure browser storage (HttpOnly cookie, which Redux cannot access, or the browser’s credential storage via Web Authentication APIs).
- **Redux DevTools in Production**: Ensure that the Redux DevTools extension is disabled or not available in production builds. The common Redux setup only enables DevTools when `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`. Double-check this. If you roll your own state management, be mindful not to expose a global hook for debugging in prod.
- **State Initialization**: Always initialize state with safe defaults. If a piece of state is meant to hold user input, initialize it as an empty string or null. Uninitialized state could be `undefined`, and if your code later treats it as a string, it might output "undefined" in the UI – not a security issue per se, but sloppy. More importantly, if an attacker manages to manipulate your app’s initial state (through some predictable localStorage key, etc.), a well-defined initial state will override it.
- **Redux Action Payloads**: Validate any data that flows into your store via actions, especially if some actions might be triggered by external input. For example, if you have an action `ADD_COMMENT` with payload text, and that comment comes from user input, sanitize it before storing in state or at least before rendering. The state itself can hold raw input if needed for editing, but once displaying, use the sanitized version.
- **Use Immer or Immutable Patterns**: Libraries like Immer (used in Redux Toolkit) help ensure you don’t accidentally mutate state. Immutable state transitions make it easier to reason about data flow and undo/redo (which could be useful if you implement something like a "preview before submit", you can throw away unsubmitted state easily).
- **React Query (TanStack Query)**: This library caches server responses (e.g., API GET requests). Treat this cached data as you would any API response:
  - If the data contains any HTML or user-generated content, sanitize or escape when rendering (React Query just stores what you give it; it doesn’t protect you from XSS).
  - Set appropriate cache times – not directly a security concern, but be cautious if you cache sensitive data. Ideally, sensitive data (like user profile with PII) should be refetched or confirmed often, not indefinitely cached on client.
  - Use query keys that do not include sensitive info in plain text (they usually don't, but just ensure you're not accidentally using, say, a raw password as a query key or something absurd).
- **Prevent State Tampering**: Remember that all client-side state can potentially be tampered by a user (for example, via the browser console or by installing a custom extension). You should never trust client state for security decisions. For example, do not have something like:
  ```js
  // BAD: relying on client state for auth (pseudo-code)
  if (store.getState().isAdmin) {
    // show admin data fetched from open endpoint
    fetch('/api/adminData').then(...)
  }
  ```
  An attacker could manually set `store.getState().isAdmin = true` in the console and then call the same function. While they shouldn’t be able to get admin data if your backend is properly secured (because the backend should check their real privileges), it shows how client state is not a security boundary. Always enforce on the server. In the UI, state is just for rendering UI appropriately.
- **Encrypted Persistent State**: If you do need to persist some sensitive client state (say offline support for some data), consider encrypting it. For example, if you save state to `localStorage` or `IndexedDB`, you could encrypt fields using the Web Crypto API before writing. The key could be derived from a user password or stored in a secure enclave. This is advanced and rarely needed for typical apps, but worth mentioning. Simpler: minimize what you persist.

**Example: Avoiding sensitive data in Redux**  
Let's say you have an authentication flow using Redux:

```ts
// An example Redux slice (using Redux Toolkit for brevity)
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  token: string | null;
}
const initialState: AuthState = { user: null, token: null };

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: "auth",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    loginSuccess(state, action: PayloadAction<{ user: User; token: string }>) {
      state.user = action.payload.user;
      state.token = action.payload.token; // WARNING: storing token
    },
    logout(state) {
      state.user = null;
      state.token = null;
    },
  },
});
```

Storing the `token` in state might be convenient (easy access throughout app), but it’s not recommended for a JWT or session token because any XSS could exfiltrate it. A safer pattern:

- Do not store the token in Redux at all. Instead, store it in a HttpOnly cookie (set by server on login) or in a React context that is not exposed globally. If you need to call APIs, you can retrieve it from the cookie (which the browser will send automatically if same-site) or from context.
- Only store `user` info in Redux for display purposes, but nothing that alone grants access.

Alternatively, if using React Context for auth state:

```tsx
const AuthContext = React.createContext<User | null>(null);

// Provide user info to component tree
<AuthContext.Provider value={user}>{children}</AuthContext.Provider>;
```

You might hold the token in a ref or closure inside your context provider logic (not in the React state), so it’s not easily accessible via the DevTools. This way, an XSS would have to specifically target that closure (still possible if XSS can call functions, but it's a bit more contained).

### 2.4 Preventing XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** is one of the most common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10: _Injection_ or specifically XSS). It occurs when an application includes untrusted data in the web page without proper validation or escaping, allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts in the user's browser. React, by design, is quite resistant to XSS because it **escapes** values in JSX by default ([XSS in React — xss 0.0.1 documentation](https://web-security-react.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/xss_in_react.html#:~:text=JSX%20Prevents%20Injection%20attacks%C2%B6)). However, there are still ways XSS can creep in if you're not careful:

- **Default Escaping**: In React, any value you embed in JSX is automatically escaped. For example:

  ```jsx
  const name = "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS') />";
  return <p>Hi {name}</p>;
  ```

  React will not render an actual `<img>` tag. It will render the literal string `&lt;img src=x onerror=alert('XSS') /&gt;`. This behavior ensures that by default you _"can never inject anything that's not explicitly written in your application"_ ([XSS in React — xss 0.0.1 documentation](https://web-security-react.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/xss_in_react.html#:~:text=JSX%20Prevents%20Injection%20attacks%C2%B6)). **This is a great safeguard**, but you must keep it intact by not bypassing it inadvertently.

- **DangerouslySetInnerHTML**: The primary escape hatch that can introduce XSS in a React app is `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. This property allows you to inject raw HTML into a component:

  ```jsx
  <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: someHTMLString }} />
  ```

  As the name suggests, it’s dangerous if `someHTMLString` contains malicious code. **Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** unless absolutely necessary (e.g., rendering content from a CMS that is trusted or already sanitized). If you must use it, **sanitize** the HTML string first:

  ```jsx
  import DOMPurify from "dompurify";
  const safeHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userProvidedHTML);
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: safeHTML }} />;
  ```

  Libraries like DOMPurify can strip or neutralize malicious content (scripts, event handlers, iframes, etc.) from HTML strings ([Reviewing OWASP Top 10: Front-End Web Development with React](https://sokurenko.net/posts/owasp-top-10-react/#:~:text=,end)).

- **User Input Fields**: If you use uncontrolled inputs or contenteditable, an attacker might inject something that later gets interpreted as HTML. For instance, if you allow users to style their profile description with HTML, one might include a `<script>` tag. Best approach: **don't allow raw HTML input from users**. If you need formatting, use a safe subset (like Markdown, which you render to HTML with a trustworthy library, or a rich text editor that sanitizes input).

- **Links and URLs**: Be careful when using user-provided URLs in link or script tags. For example:

  ```jsx
  <a href={userProvidedUrl}>Click here</a>
  ```

  By itself, React will set the href attribute to whatever string is given. If `userProvidedUrl` starts with `javascript:`, this could potentially execute code when clicked. Many browsers mitigate `javascript:` in anchor tags (especially if not specifically enabled), but it’s not foolproof. A safer approach is to validate or sanitize URLs:

  ```jsx
  const safeUrl = userUrl.startsWith("http") ? userUrl : "https://default";
  <a href={safeUrl}>Link</a>;
  ```

  Or use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on links to third-party to avoid opening attack vectors (this prevents the new page from accessing `window.opener` and possibly changing location of your page).

- **Event Handlers**: Don’t ever set an event handler from user input. React’s synthetic events (e.g., `onClick={...}`) should always be bound to functions you define. If you find yourself doing something like:

  ```jsx
  const handle = new Function("alert('hi')"); // DO NOT DO THIS
  <button onClick={handle}>Click</button>;
  ```

  That's essentially `eval` and is dangerous. Similarly, do not serially fetch event handler code from server to execute on client. Keep event logic static in your code.

- **Third-party DOM manipulation**: If you use third-party libraries that directly manipulate the DOM (outside React's virtual DOM), be wary. For instance, some old jQuery plugins or even some React wrappers around them might inject HTML. Use well-known libraries and read their security notes. If you must use one, try to constrain where and how it operates (e.g., provide only safe data to it).

- **CSP (Content Security Policy)**: As an additional layer, implementing a CSP can significantly mitigate XSS impact by restricting where scripts can load from. We'll discuss CSP in the headers section, but note that in development, React injects some inline scripts (for hot reloading, etc.), which CSP would block unless you allow `unsafe-eval/inline`. In production, aim for a CSP that disallows inline scripts, which would make it harder for any injected script to run. Even if an attacker finds an XSS hole, CSP could stop the malicious script from executing.

**Example: XSS via dangerouslySetInnerHTML**

```jsx
// Suppose this content comes from an API or user input
const bio = "<b>About me:</b> I love coding <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS') />";

// Insecure usage:
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: bio }}></div>;
```

The above will execute the `onerror` script when the browser tries to load the broken image, triggering an XSS alert.

**Secure solution:** sanitize the `bio` HTML:

```jsx
import DOMPurify from "dompurify";
const cleanBio = DOMPurify.sanitize(bio);
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: cleanBio }}></div>;
```

Now the malicious parts (like `onerror` attribute or script tags) would be stripped out or neutralized by DOMPurify. Alternatively, if you don't truly need HTML formatting, just render as text:

```jsx
<p>{bio}</p>
```

This way React will escape it (showing the `<b>` and `<img>` tags as text).

- **React Escaping Quirk**: Remember that React escapes content in JSX context (between tags or as attribute values if passed as a string). But if you do something unconventional like set `innerHTML` via refs, you bypass React. E.g.:

  ```jsx
  const divRef = useRef < HTMLDivElement > null;
  useEffect(() => {
    if (divRef.current) {
      divRef.current.innerHTML = bio; // acts like dangerouslySetInnerHTML outside React
    }
  }, [bio]);
  <div ref={divRef}></div>;
  ```

  This will inject raw HTML without React's safety net. Avoid such patterns. If you need to use refs for direct DOM access, be cautious about what you do.

- **No Eval**: While not exactly XSS, using `eval()` or similar (like `new Function`) on user-supplied strings is equivalent to inviting XSS. Never eval JSON or code from server; use `JSON.parse` for data and well-defined logic for any dynamic behavior.

### 2.5 Avoiding Injection Flaws in the Front-End

OWASP defines _Injection_ (A03:2021) broadly, including SQL injection, LDAP injection, etc., which are primarily server-side issues. However, from a front-end perspective, you can take steps to avoid being the source or enabler of injection attacks:

- **Parameterize API Calls**: If your frontend interacts with an API that expects queries or filters, ensure you pass user input as parameters, not by constructing raw queries. For example, with REST:

  ```js
  // Bad: constructing a query string unsafely
  fetch("/api/search?query=" + userInput);

  // Good: use URLSearchParams or encodeURIComponent
  const params = new URLSearchParams({ query: userInput });
  fetch("/api/search?" + params.toString());
  ```

  This makes sure special characters in `userInput` are percent-encoded and can’t break the query structure. Similarly, for GraphQL:

  ```js
  // Bad: string concatenation in GraphQL query
  const query = `{ findUser(name: "${userInput}") { id } }`; // dangerous if userInput contains quotes
  client.query({ query: gql(query) });

  // Good: use variables
  client.query({
    query: gql`
      query FindUser($name: String!) {
        findUser(name: $name) {
          id
        }
      }
    `,
    variables: { name: userInput },
  });
  ```

  Using variables ensures the `userInput` is passed as a value, not part of the query language syntax, preventing GraphQL injection.

- **No SQL/LDAP on Frontend**: This might go without saying, but do not run SQL queries or LDAP queries directly from the front-end. Those should only happen on servers. If you find yourself tempted to do something like a full-text search by downloading lots of data and then filtering, consider that a design smell (and inefficient). Proper architecture will mitigate injection inherently by keeping such operations server-side.

- **Command Injection in Node (for SSR)**: If your React app is purely client-side, you likely don't run OS commands. But if you use Node.js for server-side rendering (or as a back-end for the React app), be very careful with functions like `child_process.exec` and `execFile`. Never feed them untrusted input without sanitization or using safe APIs (like `execFile` with args array rather than `exec` with a composed string).

- **RegEx Injection**: If you build regex patterns dynamically from user input (perhaps for client-side validation), you could create a denial of service (ReDoS) if not careful. For example:

  ```js
  const pattern = new RegExp("^" + userInput + "$");
  ```

  If `userInput` is something like `a+++){` it could produce a problematic regex. Always escape or sanitize input if using in a regex pattern, or avoid dynamic regex. There are libraries or functions to escape regex special chars.

- **JSON Injection**: If you take user input and directly put it into a JSON structure that will be parsed, that's typically fine (since JSON.parse will treat it as data). Just be cautious if you allow raw JSON input from users to be parsed by `JSON.parse` in your app; improper handling (like using `eval` for JSON) could be exploited. Always use `JSON.parse` or a safe parser.

- **Preventing HTML Injection in Templates**: We covered this with XSS, but it's essentially HTML injection. Use React’s escaping or sanitize as needed.

- **Log Injection**: If your front-end logs events (to console or to a backend), be mindful that an attacker could inject malicious strings that could screw up log parsing or viewing. For instance, something that injects terminal escape characters could mess with a terminal viewer. This is a minor point, but sanitize inputs if you log them to a server or at least be aware of how logs are consumed.

- **Headers or Storage**: If you store user input in cookies, localStorage, etc., consider characters that could break out of the storage format. For cookies, the backend should set them properly (encoding values). For localStorage, since it's key/value of strings, use JSON.stringify to store complex objects to avoid format issues.

In general, the **front-end should validate and sanitize inputs** not as a primary defense (server should always validate too), but to catch issues early and provide better UX. By the time data is sent to a server, it should be in a clean format, reducing the risk of injection attacks on the server side ([React Security Vulnerabilities that you should never ignore! | Simform](https://www.simform.com/blog/react-security-vulnerabilities-solutions/#:~:text=,Write%20customized%20whitelisted%20validation%20codes)). And by the time data from server is used on frontend, it should be sanitized or encoded properly, reducing the risk of DOM injection.

**Example: GraphQL query construction (secure vs insecure)**  
Insecure:

```js
function searchProducts(name) {
  const query = `{ products(filter: "${name}") { id, title } }`;
  return client.query({ query: gql(query) });
}
searchProducts('"; drop table users;'); // Attacker attempt, this breaks query syntax
```

This could mess up the query. Instead:

Secure:

```js
function searchProducts(name) {
  return client.query({
    query: gql`
      query Search($name: String!) {
        products(filter: $name) {
          id
          title
        }
      }
    `,
    variables: { name },
  });
}
```

Even if `name` contains `"; drop table users;`, it doesn't matter – it can't escape the context of that String variable in GraphQL. The server resolver would receive the string literal `"; drop table users;` as input, which presumably matches no product, as opposed to executing anything. (The actual dropping would require a flawed resolver, but we avoid giving the attacker any syntax control.)

### 2.6 Checklist: Secure UI Development

Review the following to ensure your application’s UI layer is built securely:

- [x] **TypeScript strict mode** is enabled, and no critical logic is left untyped (`any` usage is minimal to none).
- [x] **Components are small and focused**, separating display and logic. No excessive direct DOM manipulation.
- [x] **User input is sanitized/validated** at the point of entry (forms) and again before rendering or sending to server.
- [x] **No dangerous HTML injection** is performed. Uses of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` are audited and safe (sanitized input or trusted content only).
- [x] **No eval or dynamic script execution** is used with untrusted input (or at all, if possible).
- [x] **State management avoids secrets**. Sensitive data (tokens, etc.) not stored in Redux or persisted storage in plain text.
- [x] **UI does not trust client-side state for security** – important checks (like auth) are enforced globally, not purely via user-manipulable state.
- [x] **All external data** (API responses, etc.) is treated as untrusted in the UI: escaped or sanitized on display.
- [x] **Third-party libraries** integrated (for UI or state) are verified for safety (no known XSS issues, etc.), and kept updated.
- [x] **Proper error handling** in place (error boundaries, try/catch around async calls) to avoid leaking debug info to users or crashing the app on bad input.

By adhering to these UI development practices, we've significantly reduced risks of XSS and related client-side issues. Next, we'll tackle authentication and authorization – critical aspects where many security breaches occur if not handled correctly.

---

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

Handling authentication (authN) and authorization (authZ) in a React application must be done carefully to protect user accounts and enforce access controls. This section covers:

- Implementing secure login flows, including OAuth2/OIDC and JWT usage in a React context.
- Managing user sessions/tokens without introducing vulnerabilities like _Broken Authentication_ (OWASP Top 10) or exposing credentials.
- Enforcing authorization on the UI (RBAC, feature flags) while understanding its limitations and the necessity of server-side enforcement.
- Enhancing account security with multi-factor authentication (MFA).

By following these guidelines, you can avoid common pitfalls like token theft, session fixation, and access control issues, thereby protecting user accounts and sensitive data.

### 3.1 Secure Login Design

**Login** is the gateway to user accounts, and thus a high-risk functionality. When designing a login flow in React:

- **Use HTTPS for Login**: Ensure the login page (and indeed the entire app) is served over HTTPS. Credentials should never travel over plain HTTP. Even in development, it's good to test via HTTPS if possible to catch any issues early.
- **Avoid Storing Plain Credentials**: When a user types their password, use state only as needed to bind the input. Do not log this state or store it beyond the login attempt. For example, if using a controlled component for an `<input type="password">`, the value will be in React state briefly – that's fine. But once you send it to the server (over an HTTPS AJAX call), clear it out of state. Some libraries or patterns keep form state around; ensure sensitive fields like passwords are cleared on submit or on unmount.
- **Implement Account Lockout / Throttling**: While this is mostly server-side, the front-end can complement by, for example, disabling the login button for a few seconds after a failed attempt or showing a CAPTCHA after multiple failures. This provides immediate feedback and can slow down automated guessing. But remember, any such measure on the client can be bypassed (an attacker can call the API directly), so it must also be enforced on the server.
- **Do not expose user enumeration**: When showing login errors, use generic messages ("Invalid username or password") rather than "Username not found" or "Password incorrect". The UI should not allow an attacker to enumerate valid usernames or emails by the error messages. Also avoid any time-based clues (like a longer delay for a valid username vs invalid).
- **Use Proven Libraries**: For handling forms and input, use battle-tested libraries like **Formik** or **React Hook Form** which handle a lot of details for you (like managing form state, validation, etc.). These libraries won't magically secure your login, but they help avoid common mistakes (e.g., Formik won't keep the form in memory if you unmount the component).
- **Password Policy Feedback**: As part of UX, you might enforce a password policy. Do so on the front-end for user convenience (e.g., show password strength or requirements), but always enforce it on the server as well. The front-end should mirror those rules to reduce user frustration but cannot be the sole enforcer.
- **Transporting Credentials**: Typically, you'll send an AJAX request to a login API endpoint with credentials. Use the `fetch` or axios, and ensure you:
  - Send over HTTPS (already stated).
  - Use correct headers (Content-Type: application/json if JSON).
  - Handle errors properly (e.g., if server returns 401 or 400, show a generic error).
  - Do not include any authentication in the URL (e.g., never send username/password in query params; use request body or basic auth header if using that scheme, but basic auth is less common in modern apps).
- **Prevent XSS at Login**: It's vital that your login page is free from XSS, because an XSS there could steal credentials directly as the user types. Already following general XSS prevention helps. Additionally, a strong Content Security Policy (disallowing external scripts) can prevent an attacker from loading a keylogger script if XSS was possible.

**Example: Login form with React Hook Form**

```tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

type LoginFields = { email: string; password: string };

function Login() {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors, isSubmitting },
  } = useForm<LoginFields>();

  const onSubmit = async (data: LoginFields) => {
    try {
      await loginApi(data.email, data.password); // send to server
      // ... handle success (store token, redirect, etc.)
    } catch (err) {
      // show an error message, e.g. set an error state
      // but do not reveal specifics
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <div>
        <label>Email:</label>
        <input type="email" {...register("email", { required: true })} />
        {errors.email && <span>Email is required</span>}
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>Password:</label>
        <input type="password" {...register("password", { required: true })} />
        {errors.password && <span>Password is required</span>}
      </div>
      <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
        Login
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

In this example, `react-hook-form` handles a lot:

- It uses refs under the hood to avoid re-rendering on each keystroke (more efficient and the password is not constantly copied into state on each key).
- It provides validation (here just "required" fields, but you could add pattern checks).
- It tracks `isSubmitting` to disable the button, preventing double submits.
  After calling the `loginApi`, you would handle storing auth info (token) if successful. We catch errors and presumably set some error state like `invalidCredentials` to show a message.

One more thing: consider **Brute-force protection**. The UI can use something like a progressive delay on each failed login attempt to slow down rapid retries (but again, cannot rely on it alone).

### 3.2 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect Integration

Instead of a classic form login to your own backend, many apps use **OAuth2/OIDC** for authentication – either via third-party identity providers (Google, Facebook, etc.) or via a centralized auth service like Auth0, Okta, AWS Cognito, etc. In a React app, integrating these needs careful handling to avoid leaking tokens or exposing the app to attacks like _OAuth token interception_:

- **Authorization Code Flow (PKCE)**: For public clients (SPA with no secret), always use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). Avoid the Implicit flow (which was historically used for SPAs) as it is less secure (it exposes tokens in URLs and doesn't support refresh tokens well). PKCE allows you to do the full OAuth code exchange without a client secret by using a dynamically generated code verifier/challenge. Most modern OAuth providers and libraries support this out of the box.
- **Use Library or SDK**: Implementing OAuth2 by hand can be error-prone. Instead, use a library like **Auth0 React SDK**, **oidc-client** (for generic OIDC), or **Firebase Auth**, etc., depending on provider. These handle details like token parsing, silent refresh, etc. For example, Auth0’s React SDK will handle redirecting to the Auth0 domain, storing the code, exchanging for token, and providing hooks for your app to get the user profile. Using a well-tested library reduces the chance of mistakes.
- **Redirect URI**: When you set up OAuth, you need a redirect URI (the URL in your app to which the OAuth provider will redirect back with the authorization code or token). Ensure this URI is exact and secure:
  - It should be an HTTPS URL (except maybe `http://localhost` for dev).
  - It should be a path that your React app can handle (e.g., `/auth/callback` route).
  - In your React routing, have a component that handles extracting the code from URL and then triggering the token exchange (if your library doesn't do it automatically).
  - Do not include sensitive info in this URL beyond the code/token from provider (which is inevitable).
- **State Parameter**: OAuth2 allows a `state` parameter to prevent CSRF in the auth flow. If using a library, ensure it uses `state` (most do). If doing manually, generate a random state (store it in localStorage or sessionStorage temporarily), and provide it in the auth request. Verify it matches when the response comes back.
- **Token Storage**: Once you receive OAuth tokens (ID token, access token, refresh token if any), you have to store them. The same concerns as JWTs apply (see next section). If possible, prefer keeping them in memory or in secure cookies. For instance, if using Auth0 or a similar service, you might not even need to manually manage tokens if their library uses `auth0.com` cookies or session.
- **Logout**: Logging out in an OAuth scenario might involve more than clearing local state. Often you'll want to also log the user out of the identity provider (especially for single sign-on scenarios). Some providers have a logout URL you can redirect to (with a post-logout redirect back to your site). Ensure you use that to fully terminate the session, and clear any local tokens stored.
- **Third-Party JS SDKs**: If using something like Firebase Auth or AWS Cognito, you're pulling in their SDK. Treat these as you would any dependency: keep them updated. They manage tokens for you (e.g., Firebase stores them in localStorage by default). You might choose to override that if concerned (Firebase lets you use in-memory or indexDB). Know how these libs store credentials.
- **Custom OAuth**: If you are connecting to some OAuth provider without a high-level SDK, consider using a generic library like `oidc-client` (which is a popular JS library for OIDC) to avoid writing token handling code from scratch.

**Example: Using Auth0 React SDK**

```tsx
// index.tsx
import { Auth0Provider } from "@auth0/auth0-react";
ReactDOM.render(
  <Auth0Provider
    domain="YOUR_DOMAIN.auth0.com"
    clientId="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
    redirectUri={window.location.origin + "/auth/callback"}
    cacheLocation="memory" // don't use localstorage unless needed
    useRefreshTokens={true} // enable refresh token rotation
  >
    <App />
  </Auth0Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

This wraps your app in Auth0Provider. Now inside your app:

```tsx
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

function NavBar() {
  const { loginWithRedirect, logout, isAuthenticated, user } = useAuth0();
  return (
    <nav>
      {isAuthenticated ? (
        <>
          <span>Welcome, {user?.name}</span>
          <button onClick={() => logout({ returnTo: window.location.origin })}>
            Log Out
          </button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => loginWithRedirect()}>Log In</button>
      )}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

Under the hood:

- `loginWithRedirect()` triggers an OAuth flow (Auth0's domain login page opens, etc.).
- After login, Auth0 redirects back to `redirectUri` with code, the SDK exchanges code for tokens (using hidden iframe or redirect technique) and stores them in memory (with `cacheLocation="memory"` we chose).
- The `useAuth0` hook gives you `user` info (decoded ID token) and tracks `isAuthenticated`.
- We chose `useRefreshTokens={true}` so it will use refresh tokens to keep the session alive, which Auth0 rotates to reduce risk of stolen refresh token reuse.

**Security considerations**:

- We used memory storage to avoid storing tokens in localStorage (reducing XSS theft risk). If the user closes the tab, they’ll have to login again unless Auth0 session still valid (which could be silently checked).
- The redirectUri is window.location.origin (domain root) plus '/auth/callback'. We should ensure our React app has a route that renders something (even a blank page) at /auth/callback so the Auth0Provider can complete the process.
- The logout uses Auth0 logout URL by specifying returnTo.

This approach offloads a ton of work to a trusted library and IdP (identity provider), which is often more secure than implementing your own sessions.

### 3.3 JWT Handling and Session Management

Many modern apps use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for session management in SPAs: the server issues a signed JWT after login, and the client uses it for subsequent API calls (usually via Authorization header). While JWTs eliminate the need for server-side session storage, they introduce new concerns:

- **Storage: Cookies vs. Local Storage vs. Memory**: This is a fundamental decision:

  - **HTTP-only Cookies**: Storing the JWT in a cookie (with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` flags) is considered more secure against XSS (since JavaScript can't read HttpOnly cookies) ([LocalStorage vs Cookies: All You Need To Know About Storing JWT ...](https://dev.to/cotter/localstorage-vs-cookies-all-you-need-to-know-about-storing-jwt-tokens-securely-in-the-front-end-15id#:~:text=Pros%3A%20The%20cookie%20is%20not,you%27re%20using%20httpOnly%20and)). The downside is cookies are vulnerable to CSRF by default (because browser will send them automatically). However, with `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict`, and/or CSRF tokens, this can be mitigated. Many developers favor cookies for JWT these days because of the XSS risk reduction.
  - **Local Storage**: Easy to implement (just call `localStorage.setItem("token", jwt)` and retrieve when needed). But if an XSS occurs, the attacker can read localStorage and exfiltrate the token, effectively hijacking the session. It's also accessible across tabs (which may be fine or not depending on your app). If using localStorage, you **must be confident in no XSS** or accept the risk. It's generally not recommended for high-security contexts.
  - **Memory (React state or closure)**: Keeping the token in a variable (e.g., React context state) means it's not persisted. This is safer in that if an XSS attack happens in a different context later or a different tab, the token might not be present. But if an attacker can run code in the context where the token exists (XSS on a page while user logged in), they can still call functions that use the token (though they can't easily extract it if you never expose it to global scope). Also, memory means the user is logged out if they refresh the page (unless you implement a refresh token mechanism).
  - **IndexedDB or other**: Similar to localStorage in being script-accessible; not much benefit unless you encrypt it.

  A common compromise: **Use HttpOnly secure cookies for refresh token, and memory or a short-lived cookie for access token**. The app uses the access token (JWT) for API calls, and when it expires, uses the refresh token (httpOnly, so not accessible to JS, thus an XSS can't directly steal it) by making a request to refresh endpoint (the browser automatically sends the refresh token cookie). This way, even if your JS is compromised, the attacker has a limited window with the in-memory access token (and if you set it to expire soon, that window is small, plus they can't get the refresh to extend it easily).

- **JWT Expiration**: Always design for JWTs to have a reasonable expiration (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour). This limits the time a stolen token is valid. Use refresh tokens to extend sessions instead of long-lived access tokens. In the UI, be prepared to handle token expiry:
  - Check the `exp` field of the JWT (if you decode it) to know when it expires.
  - Proactively refresh a minute before expiry or so (to avoid race conditions).
  - If the refresh fails or the user is idle too long, require re-login.
- **Token Scope and Audience**: Ensure the JWT is scoped properly. E.g., an access token should have an `aud` (audience) claim corresponding to your API, and perhaps a `scope` claim if using OAuth scopes. Your front-end should treat tokens as opaque (you might decode them for display like user name, but never trust sensitive info from them without server verification). The backend will verify them properly (signature, etc.).
- **Protecting Against Token Theft**: Besides storage decisions:
  - Implement **CSP** to make XSS harder (which could steal tokens).
  - Consider rotating JWTs or using short lifespans.
  - Monitor for suspicious use (e.g., token used from two different IPs far apart - though that’s more backend's job to detect).
- **Session Fixation**: If using cookies for JWT, be aware of session fixation (attacker sets a token for a user and somehow the user uses it). Usually less of an issue with JWT because the attacker would need to trick the user to use a known token, which is hard unless XSS. Just ensure on login, you always issue a fresh token (don't reuse an old one).
- **Logout**: When logging out:
  - If JWT in memory or storage, clear it (remove from localStorage, reset state).
  - If JWT in cookie, you cannot remove HttpOnly cookie via JS (HttpOnly means JS can't touch it). Instead, have the server set a Set-Cookie with the same name and an expired date to clear it, or if SameSite allows, call an API endpoint `/logout` that does this.
  - Also invalidate refresh tokens on server if you keep a whitelist (if stateless, you can't, but many implementations store a hash of refresh tokens server-side so they can revoke).
- **Avoid JWT in URLs**: Never send JWTs as query params or fragments to your React app routes beyond the initial OAuth redirect scenario (and if that happens, handle it immediately and replace the URL). If a JWT appears in URL, it can be logged or leaked via referrer headers.

**Example: Using JWT with HttpOnly Cookie (Recommended)**  
The flow:

1. User submits login form (email, password) via fetch to `/api/login`.
2. Server verifies and responds with:
   - Set-Cookie: `refreshToken=<refresh_jwt>; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict; Path=/api/refresh` (for example)
   - Response body: an access JWT (or you could also put access token in a cookie if you want everything in cookies).
3. The React app, on receiving response, stores the access token in a React state (or maybe a non-HttpOnly cookie with short life).
4. For subsequent API calls, the app includes the access token in Authorization header:
   ```js
   fetch("/api/data", {
     headers: {
       Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
     },
   });
   ```
   The refresh token cookie will be sent automatically on same-site requests to `/api/refresh` when needed.
5. When `accessToken` expires (maybe the server returns 401 with "token expired" or the app knows via exp claim), the app calls:
   ```js
   await fetch("/api/refresh", { method: "POST", credentials: "include" });
   ```
   Because `credentials: 'include'` is set, the refresh cookie is sent. The server validates it and if good, issues a new access token (and possibly a new refresh token cookie).
6. The app receives new access token, updates its state, and retries the original request.
7. On logout, app calls `/api/logout` (which server handles by clearing refresh cookie or blacklisting token) and also forgets the access token in memory.

This approach ensures the refresh token (which is long-lived and powerful) is HttpOnly and can't be stolen by JS. The access token is short-lived and only in memory, so it's harder to steal (attacker would need an active XSS at that moment). Also, `SameSite=Strict` ensures the refresh cookie isn't sent on cross-site contexts (preventing CSRF on the refresh endpoint; although one might argue refresh endpoint only responds with new token, but if attacker could trick a user into hitting it, they'd get a token unless you tie tokens to IP or device).

**Caveat**: If your app needs to call APIs on a different domain (CORS scenario), cookies can still be used but you need `SameSite=None; Secure` and you must send `credentials: 'include'` with fetch. Then you also need to ensure your CORS config allows credentials and origin is matched. This complicates things but is doable.

### 3.4 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Authorization** determines what each authenticated user can do. While the ultimate enforcement of roles/permissions must happen on the server (never trust the client alone), implementing RBAC in the front-end is still important for UX and to prevent users from even attempting disallowed actions via the UI.

- **Define Roles/Permissions Clearly**: At app start (after login), determine the user's roles or permissions. Often, the JWT or user profile contains this info (e.g., a `roles` array claim). Alternatively, you may have an API call like `/api/me` that returns roles/permissions. Save this info in a context or Redux state.
- **Protect Routes**: Use a route guarding mechanism. For example, if using React Router:

  ```tsx
  // Define a component to guard routes
  const AdminRoute = ({ children, ...rest }) => {
    const { user } = useAuthContext();
    return (
      <Route
        {...rest}
        render={() =>
          user?.role === "admin" ? children : <Navigate to="/403" />
        }
      />
    );
  };

  // Usage:
  <Routes>
    <Route
      path="/admin"
      element={
        <AdminRoute>
          <AdminDashboard />
        </AdminRoute>
      }
    />
  </Routes>;
  ```

  In this snippet, if the user isn't admin, they get redirected to a "403 Forbidden" page or back to home. This prevents navigation to the component. Even if someone manually tries `/#/admin` or similar, the app will check and block. (They could still see the admin bundle loaded potentially, but not the data, and likely your admin component will fetch admin-only data which will fail on server if unauthorized.)

- **Conditional Rendering**: In components, conditionally render buttons/links based on permissions. E.g.:
  ```jsx
  {
    user.canDelete && <button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete Item</button>;
  }
  ```
  If the user lacks `canDelete` permission, they won't even see the button. This reduces temptation or confusion. However, an attacker could still craft the `handleDelete` call via console, so again, server must check permission on the actual API call.
- **Feature Flagging**: Sometimes, not exactly roles, but you may want to enable/disable features for certain groups of users or as a rollout. Feature flags services (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Unleash) often work by providing a configuration to the front-end about which features are on. These can be considered a form of authorization for features. They should be kept secure (the config may come from an API or be baked in for a release). Don’t rely on hiding a feature as the only security if that feature involves sensitive operations – treat it as an additive measure for controlling rollout.
- **Least Privilege**: Design roles such that each user only has the minimum rights they need. For example, have separate roles for "User", "Moderator", "Admin", etc., rather than giving everyone admin. This is more about backend design but front-end should reflect it in UI.
- **Visual Cues for Unauthorized Access**: If a user somehow tries to access something they aren't allowed (maybe a link shared with them), show a proper "Access Denied" message, not a generic error or blank page. This helps distinguish true errors from permission issues. However, do not overly reveal what they missed ("Access Denied: you are not an administrator" is okay, but "Nice try, only role X can do Y" might be too much info).
- **Testing**: Test the UI with different roles. Ensure that no sensitive info is accidentally shown to the wrong role. For instance, an admin panel link should not appear in the menu for a normal user. Or if the same component is used for two roles with slight differences, double-check the differences (maybe one role shouldn't see a certain column in a table).
- **Beware Client-Side Only Enforcement**: A determined attacker with developer tools can usually imitate another role on the client by modifying JavaScript or state (e.g., flipping their role in Redux store). This won’t give them actual access if the server is secure, but it could potentially let them load an admin UI. That alone is not a full breach (since the admin UI will call admin APIs which should reject them), but it could leak some info if any part of the UI itself had sensitive embedded info. So make sure the UI doesn't contain sensitive data by default that only an admin should see _before_ calling an API. Ideally, everything sensitive is fetched when needed, and that fetch will fail if unauthorized. So the worst they get is maybe seeing the structure of the admin page.
- **Granular Permissions**: In some apps, it's more granular than roles (like ACLs on specific resource). Implementing that in UI might involve checking if `user.permissions` contains a certain entry. Patterns are similar to roles but with potentially more combinations. Consider a hook or utility function to check permission, to avoid repeating logic:
  ```ts
  function hasPermission(user, perm) {
    return user.permissions.includes(perm);
  }
  // usage:
  if (hasPermission(user, 'DELETE_ITEM')) { show delete button }
  ```
  This way if your permission logic ever changes (like super-admins bypass certain checks), you can adjust in one place.

**Example: Role-based component rendering**  
Assume after login, we have something like:

```ts
// after verifying token, set user context
setUser({ name: "Alice", role: "editor" });
```

And suppose roles: 'editor' can view content, 'admin' can also manage users.

In the sidebar menu component:

```jsx
<nav>
  <Link to="/content">Content</Link>
  {user?.role === "admin" && <Link to="/user-management">User Management</Link>}
</nav>
```

Alice (editor) will only see "Content". Bob (admin) sees both.

Route protection:

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/content" element={<ContentPage />} />
  <Route
    path="/user-management"
    element={
      user?.role === "admin" ? <UserManagementPage /> : <Navigate to="/403" />
    }
  />
  <Route path="/403" element={<ForbiddenPage />} />
</Routes>
```

This ensures if someone without admin rights tries to go to /user-management, they'll end up on a Forbidden page (which says "You do not have access" or such). Meanwhile, if an admin goes, they get the page.

On the server side, of course, endpoints for user management must check the user's token claims/role and return 403 if not admin, to truly enforce it.

### 3.5 Feature Flagging for Security

Feature flags are toggles that allow turning features on or off (per user, environment, etc.) without redeploying code. While often used for gradual releases or A/B testing, they can also enhance security in a few ways:

- **Kill Switch for Vulnerable Feature**: If you discover a newly released feature has a vulnerability, having it behind a feature flag means you can disable it for all users quickly by flipping the flag off, without deploying a hotfix immediately. This buys time to patch properly. It's a proactive design: not all features need flags, but high-risk ones or new ones might be good candidates.
- **Limiting Feature to Certain Users**: During a beta, you might only enable a feature for a small group (say internal testers or premium users). If something goes wrong, impact is limited.
- **Implementing Flags**:
  - **Remote Config Services**: You can use services like LaunchDarkly, ConfigCat, Firebase Remote Config, etc., which provide dashboards to change flags and SDKs to fetch flag values in your app. They often allow targeting rules (like enable X for user ID in some list).
  - **Build-time or ENV flags**: Simpler approach is to bake flags into env vars (like `REACT_APP_NEW_FEATURE=true` for a build) or config JSON fetched from server.
  - **Roll your own**: You could have an API that the app calls on startup to get a JSON of feature flags for the current user (with logic on server to decide which flags true/false for that user).
- **Secure Flags**: Treat feature flag values coming from a server as you would any config – don't trust them blindly if they come from an untrusted source. Typically the flag service is something you control, so it's fine. But for example, don't let a user influence their own flags from the client (e.g., if you store in localStorage, an attacker could flip it).
- **Front-end Use**: Use flags to conditionally render components or even conditionally load modules:
  ```jsx
  {
    flags.newDashboard ? <NewDashboard /> : <OldDashboard />;
  }
  ```
  Or for code splitting:
  ```jsx
  const NewDashboard = React.lazy(() => import("./NewDashboard"));
  // ...
  {
    flags.newDashboard && (
      <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
        <NewDashboard />
      </Suspense>
    );
  }
  ```
  If the flag is false, you never even load the new code (which might have a bug).
- **Keep Flags Temporary**: From a maintenance perspective, plan to remove flags once the feature is fully rolled out and stable. Old code hanging around can become a liability if forgotten.
- **Permissions vs Flags**: Don't confuse flags with security permissions. Flags are usually not meant as a security barrier – they are more for controlling rollout or availability. If a feature should only be for admins, that's an authZ check, not a feature flag (though you might implement it with a flag "admin_only_feature" that is true only for admins, but then it's effectively the same as checking role).
- **Example**: Suppose you have a new payments system integration. You put it behind `enableNewPayments`. The UI checks this flag to decide whether to show the "Try new payment system" button. If a severe issue is found in it, you flip `enableNewPayments` to false globally – the button disappears for users quickly. (If a user had the page open with the button already visible, they'd need a refresh to see it gone, so it's not a perfect instantaneous fix, but it's quick.)
- **Flag Security**: The distribution of flags is critical. Services like LaunchDarkly use streaming or polling to give flag values to the client. Ensure that communication is secure (HTTPS, and if they require an SDK key on the client, that's usually a client-side ID and not super sensitive, but protect it). Also be mindful that flag configs could potentially be exposed to users (especially if delivered as JSON to client). Don’t put secrets in feature flag names or values. Typically the worst that happens is a user might figure out that a feature is disabled or enabled for them by inspecting network calls.
- **Circuit Breakers**: In a broader sense, a feature flag is a form of circuit breaker. For security, it's nice to have the ability to turn off portions of functionality if something goes wrong. Plan those switches early.

### 3.6 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA adds an extra layer beyond just password – like a one-time code, push notification approval, or biometric. Integrating MFA in a React app might involve:

- **Using Existing Solutions**: If you use an auth provider (Auth0, AWS Cognito, etc.), leverage their MFA options. For example, Auth0 can enforce MFA after the initial login. Then the React app will get a response like "MFA required", and you can use their UI widget or API to complete MFA (e.g., ask for OTP code).
- **Implementing TOTP (Authenticator App Codes)**: If rolling your own backend, you might implement TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password, like Google Authenticator). The typical flow:

  1. User opts in to MFA (or at first login, you enforce it).
  2. Server generates a secret for the user and perhaps a QR code for an authenticator app.
  3. User scans and provides a code from their app to verify setup.
  4. Thereafter, at login, after password is correct, server says "need OTP", the React app asks user for the 6-digit code, sends to server for verification.
  5. Only then issues JWT or session on success.

  On the React side, you'll need screens to handle these steps (setup MFA, and challenge prompt).

- **SMS/Email Codes**: Simpler but maybe less secure forms (since SMS can be intercepted, email can be slow/insecure):
  - Use an API to send an SMS or email with a code when needed (e.g., after password login).
  - Present an input for the code. Ensure you obscure the code entry just like password (not showing what they type if sensitive).
  - Rate-limit code requests to avoid SMS flood or enumeration (mostly server task).
- **WebAuthn (Security Keys/Biometrics)**: WebAuthn allows using hardware keys (like Yubikey) or device biometrics for MFA (or even passwordless login).
  - The WebAuthn API is accessible in browser. The flow:
    - Registration: After user logs in normally (or during signup), you call `navigator.credentials.create({...})` with a challenge from your server. This will trigger a prompt to use a security key or fingerprint, etc. If user consents, you'll get a `credential` which you send to server to store (public key, etc.).
    - Login: After password (or for passwordless, just this), call `navigator.credentials.get({...})` with a challenge from server and user ID info. If the credential from before is present and user verifies (press key or finger), you get a assertion to send to server for verification.
    - This is advanced, but provides phish-resistant MFA.
  - Libraries exist to help (like the browser API is straightforward, but handling binary data and server verification is heavy lifting).
  - If implementing, ensure you're on HTTPS and have proper UI cues (the browser will mostly handle the prompt).
- **Backup Codes**: If MFA is enforced, provide a way for users to get backup codes (one-time use passwords) in case they lose their device. Store/display these safely (e.g., show once after setup, or allow regeneration by re-auth).
- **Remember MFA**: Often services allow "remember this device for 30 days" where they set a cookie so next time user from same device doesn't need MFA. If you want that, implement by having the server issue a long-lived cookie when user opts to remember. Then at login, server sees cookie and bypasses MFA. The React app's role is just to offer a checkbox "Remember me on this device" when doing MFA.
- **Phishing awareness**: Educate in UI to not give MFA codes to anyone. Attackers sometimes try to trick users into giving MFA codes. A subtle UI thing: when asking for the code, maybe remind "Only use the code from your authenticator app or message. We will never ask for this via phone or email." etc.
- **Timeouts**: For security, you may want to require MFA again for sensitive actions or after some time. E.g., user logged in, browsing normally, but when they go to change password or view a very sensitive data page, ask for MFA re-auth (often called Step-up authentication). This can be done by having the server enforce a fresh token with MFA claim or using prompt=login if OIDC. On UI, handle a 401 that indicates "MFA required again" by popping the MFA prompt.
- **UI Implementation Example**:  
  Let's say after user enters password, you get a response `{ "mfa_required": true, "mfa_method": "totp" }`. The UI then shows:

  ```jsx
  <p>Enter the 6-digit code from your Authenticator app:</p>
  <input type="text" value={code} onChange={...} maxLength={6} />
  <button onClick={submitCode}>Verify</button>
  ```

  On submit, call `/api/verify-mfa` with the code (and maybe a token linking to their pending session). If success, proceed to logged-in state. If fail, show error and maybe allow retry (with a limit).

  If using Auth0 or another IdP, they might handle this via redirect or their own UI widget. For instance, Auth0 can be configured to send an OTP email automatically and it will ask on their hosted login page.

- **Don’t Bypass**: Ensure that all login methods honor the MFA. E.g., if you have social login (Google login) plus password login, and you enforce MFA on accounts, consider how that plays with Google login (maybe those users are exempt or you require they also set up an MFA in your system).

Implementing MFA adds complexity but significantly improves account security by mitigating stolen password scenarios.

### 3.7 Checklist: Auth & AuthZ

Go through this checklist to ensure authentication and authorization are implemented securely:

- [x] **Login form secured**: Uses HTTPS, no plaintext credentials stored or exposed in logs, generic error messages, and optional client-side throttling for rapid failures.
- [x] **Password handling**: Properly masked inputs, front-end validation aligns with server policy, and password not reused or kept in state longer than needed.
- [x] **OAuth/OIDC flows**: Using Authorization Code + PKCE for SPA. Redirect URIs and state parameters are set correctly. Tokens are handled via a reliable library.
- [x] **Token storage strategy**: Decided and implemented (prefer HttpOnly cookies for long-term tokens, no localStorage for sensitive tokens unless justified). A refresh mechanism in place if using short-lived tokens.
- [x] **JWT validation**: Front-end only decodes JWT for non-sensitive info (like display name). No reliance on JWT content for security decisions except as provided by server (e.g., roles claim can be used for UI but server still checks it).
- [x] **Session management**: Logout fully clears tokens (and informs server to invalidate if needed). Token expiration is handled gracefully (with refresh or re-login flow).
- [x] **RBAC in UI**: UI components and routes are gated by user role/perm. No admin-only functionality is shown or enabled for non-admin users.
- [x] **Server-side enforcement**: (Out of front-end scope to implement, but ensure) server API actually enforces auth and roles. The app does not assume the front-end checks alone are enough.
- [x] **Feature flags**: Any critical new feature is behind a flag if applicable. Toggling flags is possible without redeploy. Flags are delivered securely and not user-tamperable.
- [x] **MFA support**: If applicable, MFA flows are integrated, thoroughly tested (including edge cases like wrong code, resending code, backup methods). The UI prompts and handles MFA seamlessly after primary login.
- [x] **Account security**: Flows for password reset, email verification, etc., are handled with the same care (though not detailed above, these should be present: e.g., password reset uses a secure token via email, and UI validates new password properly).

At this point, we've locked down authentication and authorization in the front-end. The user login system is robust, and our app only shows what it should to each user. Next, let's ensure the communication between our React app and back-end services is secure.

## 4. Secure API Communication

A React front-end typically communicates with back-end APIs (REST, GraphQL, etc.) to fetch or modify data. Even if your UI code is flawless, insecure network communication can expose you to eavesdropping, tampering, or CSRF attacks. This section will cover:

- Enforcing HTTPS and using secure request patterns.
- Setting the appropriate security-related HTTP headers.
- Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in state-changing operations.
- Properly configuring Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) when dealing with different domains.
- Best practices for consuming RESTful APIs and GraphQL from a security standpoint.

By the end of this section, you’ll know how to safely handle the exchange of data between your React app and the server, ensuring integrity and confidentiality.

### 4.1 Enforcing HTTPS and TLS

**HTTPS (HTTP over TLS)** is non-negotiable for any application dealing with user data or authentication. It provides encryption and integrity for data in transit, protecting against man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

- **Use HTTPS Everywhere**: Your production app should be served over HTTPS only. If a user accidentally tries `http://yourapp.com`, configure a redirect to the HTTPS URL (this is usually done at the server or load balancer level). Services like Netlify/Heroku often handle this if you set "Force TLS" settings. If deploying on AWS, use CloudFront or ALB with HTTPS and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**: This is a header (`Strict-Transport-Security`) that tells browsers "always use HTTPS for this domain". If set (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`), the browser won’t even attempt HTTP for the specified period (here 1 year) after the first successful HTTPS connection. Use this in production to prevent any downgrade attacks or user clicking an http link. Be careful: once on, it's hard to turn off (browser remembers), but it's a good thing for security. Many sites submit their domain to the HSTS preload list to be baked into browsers as HTTPS-only from first launch.
- **TLS Configuration**: While it’s more of a server concern, ensure you use up-to-date TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or 1.3) and strong cipher suites on your server. As a front-end dev, you might not control this, but you should at least verify it. Weak encryption or older protocols (TLS 1.0/1.1) should be avoided as they're deprecated.
- **Certificate Management**: Use valid TLS certificates (from Let's Encrypt or a trusted CA). If users ever see a certificate warning in the browser, they'll likely abandon or be vulnerable if they proceed. For local development, consider using a local dev certificate (like via mkcert or OpenSSL) so you can test HTTPS locally without invalid cert warnings (though it's optional for dev).
- **Mixed Content**: Ensure all resources loaded by your app are over HTTPS as well. If you include any script, image, or XHR to an `http://` URL while your page is HTTPS, modern browsers will either block it (if active content like scripts) or warn (if passive like images). This could break functionality or open security holes (an HTTP script can compromise the page). So all API endpoints, CDNs for assets, etc., should be HTTPS. If you use a third-party API that doesn't offer HTTPS – find an alternative; it's 2025, everything should have HTTPS.
- **Upgrade Insecure Requests CSP**: There's a Content Security Policy directive `upgrade-insecure-requests` that can auto-upgrade `http://` links to `https://` if possible. It's a nice safeguard if you inadvertently have an HTTP URL. But it's better to fix the URLs. Still, enabling this in your CSP can be useful as a fallback.
- **WebSockets**: If your app uses websockets, use `wss://` (the secure WebSocket protocol) on an HTTPS site. Browsers won't allow insecure WS (`ws://`) from an HTTPS origin.
- **API Servers**: If your React app calls an API (say at `https://api.yourapp.com`), that API should also enforce HTTPS. If it's under your control, same steps apply. If calling third-party APIs, ensure they provide an HTTPS endpoint (most do).
- **Client Certificate Pinning**: On web, you don't have the same pinning ability as mobile, but you can use Subresource Integrity (for scripts) and other methods. Certificate pinning is generally not done in browsers (HPKP header was deprecated). Instead, rely on CA trust and HSTS.

### 4.2 Security HTTP Headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

HTTP response headers can greatly improve security by instructing browsers to enable/disable certain features. As a React developer, you typically configure these on the server or in your static hosting platform. Key headers to consider:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: CSP is one of the most effective defenses against XSS. It allows you to specify which sources of content are allowed. For example, you can say "only allow scripts from my domain and trusted CDNs, disallow inline scripts and eval". A strict CSP might look like:

  ```
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' cdn.trusted.com; object-src 'none'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self';
  ```

  This says: by default, only allow content from same origin. Scripts only from same origin and cdn.trusted.com (no inline scripts unless they have a nonce or hash, since we didn't allow 'unsafe-inline'). object-src 'none' disables Flash/objects. style-src allows self and unsafe-inline (inline CSS is often used by frameworks or needed for styling, if you can avoid inline styles and not use 'unsafe-inline', even better). frame-ancestors 'none' prevents other sites from framing this site (clickjacking protection). base-uri 'self' prevents abuse of `<base>` tag if injected. form-action 'self' ensures forms only submit to self (preventing form hijacking).

  Setting a CSP for an SPA might require some care:

  - If you use a script tag from a CDN (like loading a third-party library), include that domain.
  - If you have runtime script injections or use eval (should be avoiding those), you'll need to adjust or add nonce/hashes.
  - You can also use `report-uri` or `report-to` in CSP to get violation reports for debugging.
  - You might start with a relaxed CSP and tighten over time as you audit what your app loads.

- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: As discussed, e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. This tells browsers not to MIME-sniff responses and instead trust the Content-Type header. It prevents certain attacks where a non-executable file could be treated as executable due to sniffing.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Though CSP's frame-ancestors covers this, older browsers use X-Frame-Options. Set `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (or SAMEORIGIN if you have a legitimate sub-frame you need to allow from same site). This prevents clickjacking by not allowing your app to be framed.
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls how much referrer info is sent when navigating away. E.g., `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` is a balanced choice: full URL referrer for same origin, but only origin for cross-origin navigations. Or `no-referrer` to send nothing. This isn't a big security hole, but can leak path info or query params if not set.
- **Permissions-Policy** (formerly Feature-Policy): This header can disable certain browser features in your app context. For example: `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=()` to disable camera/mic usage entirely (if your app doesn't need them, an XSS couldn't even open them). Or limit geolocation: `geolocation=(self)`.
- **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) / Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP)**: These are more for enabling powerful features (like SharedArrayBuffer) by isolating the context. If you need those, you'll delve into COOP/COEP to avoid Spectre-like issues. Not directly about OWASP Top 10, but good to know.
- **Server side**: If using Node/Express for SSR or API, you can use Helmet (the `helmet` npm package) which sets many of these by default.
- **Meta Tags vs Headers**: Some headers like CSP and HSTS _must_ be headers. However, CSP can also be delivered via a `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" ...>` tag in the HTML. If you're deploying a static React app via something like Netlify, and you can't easily set headers, you could include a CSP meta tag in `public/index.html`. Note that meta CSP may not cover everything (especially if your HTML is minimal and rest is JS loaded). But it will apply to loaded scripts.
- **Testing**: Use browser dev tools or online scanners (like securityheaders.com) to verify your app's headers. Achieve A+ where possible. However, ensure CSP doesn't break your legitimate functionality. It's often iterative to get right.

### 4.3 Preventing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

CSRF is an attack where an unauthorized site tricks a user's browser into making a request to your site, using the user's session (cookies). For example, if a user is logged into `bank.com`, an attacker site could make the user's browser submit a form to `bank.com/transfer` to move money, using the session cookie automatically. Key approaches to prevent CSRF:

- **SameSite Cookies**: Modern approach is using the `SameSite` attribute on cookies. By setting `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict` on session cookies, the browser will not send them on cross-site requests (with Lax, it won't send on cross-site subrequests like images/forms via GET, but will send on top-level navigation GET; with Strict, it won't send even on those). In practice:
  - If your app is purely an API + SPA on the same domain (or subdomain), you can set `SameSite=Strict` on the auth cookies since the only context you use them is your domain itself.
  - If you need cross-site (like your API is on api.domain.com and front-end on domain.com, that is not cross-site as long as domain.com and api.domain.com can be considered same-site by setting cookie domain appropriately and controlling scheme+registrable domain; but if different domains entirely or you need to allow some cross-site usage, you'll need other measures).
- **CSRF Tokens**: The traditional method is to use a secret token that the browser does not automatically include. Typically:
  - Server sets a CSRF token (e.g., in a cookie or in the HTML of the page, or an initial API call).
  - The React app reads this token (from cookie or from a global variable injected in page).
  - The app sends this token in an HTTP header (like `X-CSRF-Token`) with any state-changing request (POST/PUT/DELETE, etc.).
  - The server verifies that token against the one in the user's session (or cookie).
  - If they don't match or not present, request is rejected.
  - Because only your domain's JS could read that token and send it, a random attacker site cannot (they can make the request but not include the correct token, because they can't read your cookies due to CORS and same origin policy).
  - Make sure to rotate/regenerate the token appropriately (often per session or per form).
- **Double Submit Cookie**: A variant where the server sends a cookie `XSRF-TOKEN` that is not HttpOnly (so JS can read it). Then the app reads from that cookie and sends it in a header. Server checks that the cookie value and header value match (and optionally match what's expected server-side). This is simpler to implement (no server-side session tracking needed beyond the cookie value).
  - Many frameworks (Django, Rails, etc.) use a cookie like this and expect a header `X-CSRFToken` or `X-XSRF-TOKEN`.
  - If using a library like Axios, there's an option to automatically send such a cookie value as header (if configured).
- **CORS as CSRF protection?**: Note, if your API is strictly configured to not allow requests from other origins (via CORS), does that solve CSRF? Not exactly. If an attacker uses a form submission or an `<img>` get to trigger an action on your site, those are not subject to XHR's CORS restrictions. CORS protects reading responses via XHR/fetch from another domain, but not posting a form. So still implement CSRF protection even if CORS is limited.
- **When CSRF tokens not needed**: If you entirely use JWT in Authorization header or OAuth flows and **do not use cookies for auth at all**, then CSRF in the traditional sense is not a threat, because an attacker cannot make the user's browser attach a JWT Authorization header to a request (only your JS would do that, and they can't run your JS). But if you store JWT in cookies, or any session cookie, CSRF is a concern.
  - However, even with JWT, consider scenarios: If an attacker can cause the user to make a request with their JWT somehow (maybe by hooking into some redirect if JWT is in URL, which it shouldn't be), it's harder though. Usually, with pure JWT in memory, CSRF is not applicable because browser doesn't automatically include the token on cross-site requests.
- **Safe Methods**: Typically CSRF protections focus on state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE). GET requests should be side-effect free (by spec) and thus should not change user state. Make sure your app follows that. If you have any GET that does something sensitive (like a GET to log the user out or a GET to /api/deleteItem), that's a design flaw; use POST for those actions. Then you can exempt GET from CSRF token requirement (some frameworks do).
- **Implementing in React**:
  - If using cookies for session, have backend set a CSRF cookie (or embed token in a meta tag in your `index.html` template if using server-side templating).
  - When making requests via fetch/axios, include the token. Example with fetch:
    ```js
    const csrfToken = getCookie("XSRF-TOKEN");
    fetch("/api/transfer-funds", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "X-CSRF-Token": csrfToken,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ amount: 100 }),
    });
    ```
    Ensure `credentials: 'include'` if it's a cross-site cookie scenario (so the session cookie goes along).
  - Example with Axios global config:
    ```js
    axios.defaults.withCredentials = true; // send cookies automatically
    axios.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
      const token = Cookies.get("XSRF-TOKEN");
      if (token) {
        config.headers["X-CSRF-Token"] = token;
      }
      return config;
    });
    ```
    This assumes you use js-cookie library to read the cookie.
- **Testing CSRF**: One way to test is try to simulate a cross-site request:
  - Serve a static HTML from another domain (or `localhost:PORT` vs `127.0.0.1:PORT` which is considered different origin) with a form that targets your API endpoint. Submit and see if it succeeds or gets blocked.
  - Also test normal usage to ensure your tokens are being included and validated.
- **SPAs and SameSite**: If your app is on the same domain as the API, you could possibly rely on SameSite=Lax cookies to mitigate most CSRF (because normal browsing triggers (link clicks) wouldn't send cookies on cross-site request unless it's top-level GET, which usually isn't how state-changing requests occur). But it's still safer to have CSRF tokens for defense-in-depth. And if any request can be triggered via an image or GET, Strict can handle those if you can use Strict (but Strict means if user clicks a link from an email to your site, the cookie might not be sent, causing them to login again potentially; Lax avoids that issue).

### 4.4 CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Configuration

**CORS** is a browser mechanism that allows a web page from one origin to request resources from another origin, given the target server allows it. Misconfiguring CORS can either break your app’s API calls or open security holes by allowing any site to fetch sensitive data from your API.

From a front-end perspective:

- **Understanding Origins**: An "origin" is scheme + host + port. So `https://api.yourapp.com` is different origin from `https://yourapp.com` (different subdomain). Also `http://yourapp.com` vs `https://yourapp.com` are different (scheme differs). If your React app is served from the same origin as the API, you don't need CORS at all. But many setups have them separate (especially for microservices or using 3rd party APIs).
- **CORS Preflight**: If you make a request that is not a simple GET/POST (with simple headers), the browser will perform a **preflight** OPTIONS request to the API to ask if it's allowed. For example, a `PUT` or a `POST` with `Content-Type: application/json` triggers preflight. The server must respond with appropriate headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, etc.) to let the actual request proceed.
- **Allowlist Origins**: The API should ideally specify specific allowed origins. E.g., allow `https://yourapp.com` and maybe a staging domain, rather than `*` (wildcard). `*` is okay for public resources that don't need credentials, but if you use credentials (cookies or HTTP auth), you cannot use `*` (the server must echo the exact origin in the ACAO header, and also set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`).
- **Using Credentials**: If your React app is calling an API that uses cookies or HTTP authentication, you need:
  - On client: set `fetch(..., { credentials: 'include' })` or `axios.defaults.withCredentials = true`.
  - On server: `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header in response, and cannot use `*` for ACAO, must specify origin.
  - Also if credentials, browsers ignore `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` even if set, for that request.
- **Exposing Headers**: If your frontend needs to read custom headers from the response (for example, the API sets `X-Total-Count` for pagination and you want to read it), the server must include `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-Total-Count` so that JS can access it. Otherwise, browser will hide it.
- **Avoiding Unnecessary CORS**: If possible, host the API under the same domain as the app (even if different subdomain, consider using a reverse proxy so that from the browser perspective it's same origin). That sidesteps CORS entirely. Many SPAs do this: e.g., deploy front-end and API under the same domain. But if using serverless or different services, it's often separate.
- **Security Misconfig**: A common vulnerability is misconfigured CORS where the server allows any origin or reflects origin header without proper checks, combined with `Allow-Credentials: true`. This can allow an attacker site to silently read data from the API using a logged-in user's session (basically a CSRF that reads data via XHR, which normally SameSite might not protect if the dev foolishly allowed `Origin: attacker.com` to get data). Ensure your backend does not do something like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: req.headers.Origin` blindly for any origin. It should check against a list.
- **Front-end Errors**: If you see CORS errors in the browser console (often "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header present" or "CORS policy disallows..."), it means the request was blocked. The solution is on the server config, but as a developer you'll coordinate that. For local dev, you might run into CORS if you're running React dev server on localhost:3000 and API on 3001. You can either:
  - Use a proxy in development (CRA supports proxy field to forward to API, making it same origin).
  - Or enable CORS for localhost:3000 on the API (just for dev).
  - For production, ensure correct domain is allowed.
- **CORS and CSP**: They are separate. CSP restricts what resources your page can load. CORS restricts what other origins can access your resources. So if your React app is calling some third-party API directly via fetch (say a public data API), that API needs to allow your origin. If it's public and doesn't allow, you might have to use a proxy because you can't bypass CORS from the client side (that would be a security issue).
- **Preflight caching**: Browsers cache preflight responses for a short time (often 5 seconds or per server header `Access-Control-Max-Age`). Excessive preflights can slow an app. It's minor, but as optimization, have your server set a decent `Access-Control-Max-Age` (e.g., a few minutes) so it doesn't preflight every time for same endpoint.
- **CORS and CSRF**: As mentioned, don't think "I have CORS limited so I'm safe from CSRF." CORS stops malicious JavaScript from reading responses, but the request can still be sent. If your API modifies state via GET (which it shouldn't) or you allow certain things, a simple form post can bypass CORS entirely. So separate concerns.

### 4.5 Secure REST API Consumption

REST is a common pattern for APIs. Consuming a REST API securely involves both how you make requests and how you handle responses/errors:

- **Use HTTP Methods as Intended**: GET for retrieving data, POST for creating, PUT/PATCH for updating, DELETE for deletion. This ensures alignment with safe methods (GET) vs unsafe (POST, etc.) which ties into caching and CSRF handling (browsers don't allow some methods to be triggered cross-site easily).
- **Avoid Sending Sensitive Data in URLs**: Don't put secrets, auth tokens, or sensitive IDs in the query string. URLs can end up in logs (like server logs, browser history, etc.). Use the request body for that kind of data. Also, the query string is visible if someone shares a link inadvertently.
- **Input Validation**: Validate or sanitize inputs before sending to API. This is not to say do server's job, but for example, if your API expects an integer ID and you have a string, maybe convert to int to avoid sending wrong type which could trigger an error (or worse, if the server is poorly coded, something like SQL injection – albeit the server should handle that).
- **HTTPS**: Already covered, but specifically ensure your fetch/axios calls always use `https://` URLs, not `http://`. This might mean having config that switches depending on env (maybe `http://localhost` for dev but `https://api.com` for prod). Mistakes here could leak data.
- **Timeouts & Error Handling**: Set reasonable timeouts on requests (if using axios, it has a timeout option). This prevents hanging forever. In error handling, be mindful not to leak any sensitive info from the error object (like if using a generic error display that might show raw error message possibly containing stack traces or server info - usually not the case because server wouldn't send stack trace to client, but just in case).
- **Retires & Rate Limit**: If you implement retry logic for failed requests (network errors), ensure it doesn't inadvertently spam an endpoint that could lock an account or be interpreted as malicious. E.g., if login fails with wrong password, don't auto-retry it.
- **API Keys for External Services**: If your React app calls third-party REST APIs that require an API key (for example, Google Maps API via REST, or weather API), remember that key is exposed in the request. Use restrictions on those keys (like restrict to certain domain or set low quotas to minimize damage if stolen).
- **Processing Responses Securely**: When you get data, treat it as untrusted. For instance, if the API returns HTML content (some APIs might), don't directly inject it into DOM without sanitization. If it returns URLs, be careful if using them (like if an API gives an image URL, ideally that should be fine, but if the URL points to a dangerous location or uses a weird scheme, maybe validate it's http/https).
- **JSON Parsing**: The fetch API returns a promise that resolves to JSON via `response.json()`. That should be safe as the browser's native JSON.parse is safe for JSON (just don't use eval for parsing JSON!). If dealing with other formats (XML or something), use safe parsers. For XML, avoid parsing untrusted XML with vulnerabilities (XXE – XML External Entity attacks – which is part of OWASP top 10). In JS, if you use DOMParser on an XML string from an untrusted source, disable external entity resolution (most browsers don't fetch external entities in XML by default in DOMParser, it's not like a full XML library that resolves DTDs, so probably okay).
- **Exposed Error Info**: If an API returns an error message, do not directly display technical details to the user. E.g., server might respond `400 Bad Request: "password too short: minimum 8 chars"`. It's okay to show that because it's a validation error meant for user. But if it responded `500 Internal Error: NullReferenceException in XYZ`, don't show that. Usually the server wouldn't send that to client, but if it did or if you have to handle it, just show a generic "An error occurred, please try again".
- **Logging**: If you log API responses (maybe to console or a monitoring service), be cautious about logging sensitive data. For instance, don't log the entire user object with their personal info on console. If using something like Sentry for front-end errors, filter PII from any data you send.
- **Avoid evaling content**: Some REST APIs might return code (can't think of a good example in modern day, but just in case: don't eval JSON or JS from response).
- **Securing file downloads/uploads**: If your app downloads files via API (like receiving a PDF blob), ensure you handle it safely (just letting user download or open with proper type). For uploads, if users can upload files through your front-end to a REST endpoint (like images), add client-side checks (file type, size) to catch issues early and inform user, though server must also check.
- **Avoid open redirects**: If any API call requires a URL as input (like your app calls `/api/fetchPage?url=http://...`), ensure the API will validate it or your app restricts what can be passed (to avoid SSRF on your server, etc.). As a client, also avoid being tricked by a response that says redirect to some external site unexpectedly (like if not intended).

### 4.6 Secure GraphQL API Consumption

Using GraphQL from a React app (often via Apollo Client or similar) has some different considerations:

- **Query and Mutation Structure**: The client usually sends a query string and variables. Always prefer using **variables** as mentioned, to avoid concatenating potentially unsafe inputs into the query string which could lead to syntax issues or errors (GraphQL injection, while not common in the same way as SQL injection, could break the logic of a query if inputs aren't properly handled).
- **Persisted Queries**: Apollo and others support persisted queries or operation whitelisting, where the client only sends an operation ID or hash, and the server has the query stored. This way, clients can't ask arbitrary queries – which can be a security improvement. If your app is distributed (like mobile), might not apply easily to web unless you build that system. But something to consider for a highly secure environment.
- **Introspection**: GraphQL servers often allow introspection (querying the schema). In production, you might want the server to disable introspection so attackers can't easily discover the schema and types. As a client dev, that means you should have the schema via your build (if needed for tools) but not rely on runtime introspection. This is more server side, but good to know.
- **Handling Errors**: GraphQL returns errors in a structured way (usually `errors` array in response). These might contain messages or even stack traces if the server isn't configured properly (hopefully not). Similar to REST, don't surface raw error messages that might have internal info. Show a user-friendly message.
- **Batching and Large Queries**: GraphQL allows batching multiple queries in one request or making deeply nested queries. From client side, be mindful not to abuse that in a way that could cause DoS on the server. For example, don't intentionally request 10000 records in one go (server should have limits anyway). If your UI needs lots of data, implement pagination or infinite scroll, etc.
- **Subscriptions (WebSockets)**: If using GraphQL subscriptions (over WebSocket or SSE), ensure the connection is secure (`wss://`) and authenticated. The client should handle reconnection securely and not leak anything. Also, a malicious actor could try to connect to your subscription endpoint outside of your app; the server should verify tokens on connection. From client, nothing special aside from including auth token in the connection params initially.
- **Local State vs GraphQL**: Apollo can combine local state with remote. If you use that, avoid writing sensitive stuff into an Apollo cache that might be rehydrated or exposed inadvertently. Similar to Redux concerns.
- **XSS via Data**: GraphQL typically returns JSON data. If some fields contain HTML or script content (rare but possible if stored in DB), treat them as untrusted just like REST. Use sanitation on render.
- **File Upload with GraphQL**: GraphQL can handle file uploads via specific libraries (like Apollo has upload link). Ensure usage of that doesn't expose file content in queries unnecessarily. It usually uses formdata under the hood, which should be fine.
- **Rate limiting**: If the client code runs potentially untrusted queries (maybe your app allows some custom GraphQL queries from user input?), you might want to restrict that or sanitize input. Usually, the app itself dictates queries, so it's fine. The server will have complexity analysis perhaps.
- **GraphQL Specific Attacks**: According to OWASP, GraphQL could suffer from things like "DoS by expensive queries" or "batch attacks" ([Best Practices | GraphQL](https://graphql.org/faq/best-practices/#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20security%20concerns,in%20a%20single%20network%20call)). As a client, just avoid doing obviously expensive things. That's more on server to defend, but being a good citizen client helps.

### 4.7 Checklist: Secure API Communication

Before concluding this section, verify the following for your app’s network interactions:

- [x] **All requests use HTTPS**. No plain HTTP calls in code (search your codebase for "http:" literals to be sure).
- [x] **HSTS enabled** (on server or host config) to enforce TLS for your domain.
- [x] **Important security headers set** (CSP, X-Frame-Options, XSS Protection if old browser support needed, etc.). CSP tested to not break app and effectively restrict unwanted sources ([Reviewing OWASP Top 10: Front-End Web Development with React](https://sokurenko.net/posts/owasp-top-10-react/#:~:text=,end)).
- [x] **CSRF protection in place** for any state-changing requests if using cookies for auth. SameSite cookies and/or CSRF tokens are implemented and tested.
- [x] **CORS configured correctly** on server:
  - Allowed origins restricted to your app’s origin(s).
  - `withCredentials` used appropriately if needed.
  - No wildcard with credentials. No internal admin-only APIs accidentally wide-open via CORS.
- [x] **API calls structured safely**:
  - No user input directly concatenated into unsafe parts of requests (URLs, queries without encoding).
  - Using appropriate methods (no illicit GET for actions).
  - Handling responses carefully (sanitizing if needed, not exposing internal info).
- [x] **Third-party calls** (if any) do not expose sensitive data and keys are handled with restrictions.
- [x] **GraphQL usage**:
  - Queries use variables properly.
  - No client-driven introspection or overly broad query allowed in prod.
  - Errors from GraphQL handled and sanitized for display.
  - Subscriptions (if used) use wss and auth.
- [x] **WebSocket fallback**: If using WS or SSE, they degrade gracefully and don't bypass auth checks.
- [x] **Testing done** with something like a proxy (OWASP ZAP or browser network monitor) to ensure there's no sensitive info in headers or payloads inappropriately (e.g., check that auth token isn't in URL, etc.).

By securing the transport and interactions with backend services, we ensure the data in transit is protected and that our front-end isn't an entry point for attacks on the server (like CSRF or injection via requests). Next, we'll focus on data handling and validation on the client side, complementing what we do on the server.

---

## 5. Data Handling & Validation

Even though validation and protection of data on the server side is paramount, implementing robust data handling on the client side improves security and user experience. This section covers:

- Safely handling user input on the client side to catch issues early.
- Best practices for validating data in forms and from APIs.
- Ensuring that sensitive data is handled appropriately in the front-end (not leaking it or exposing it inadvertently).
- Preventing exposure of data via client-side caches or storage.

Let's strengthen our app by treating all data carefully, whether it's coming from the user or the server.

### 5.1 Safe Handling of User Input

User input is a major source of risk (think XSS, injection). On the client side, handling it safely involves:

- **Validation on Input**: As the user types or submits a form, validate the data for correctness (format, length, allowed characters). Use built-in HTML5 validation attributes (like `type="email"`, `required`, `minlength`, etc.) or utilize libraries like **Yup** or **Validator.js** to check the input. This helps catch mistakes or potentially malicious patterns early. For instance, if expecting a phone number digits-only, you can prevent letters from being entered or at least flag it.
- **Input Sanitization**: In some cases, you may want to sanitize input on the fly. For example, stripping script tags or unusual characters. However, be careful: sanitizing user input at the client (like removing `<script>` from a text field) might hamper a pentester's or attacker’s ability to demonstrate an XSS, but if your backend isn't properly sanitizing, the vulnerability still exists. Focus on validation (ensure it meets expected format) and let the server sanitize if needed. But for things like removing trailing spaces or normalizing line endings, it’s fine.
- **Escape on Output**: If you echo user input back in the UI (like an instant preview or populating one field based on another), use methods that don't introduce XSS. React does this by default (never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with raw input).
- **Avoid Reflecting in URLs**: Don’t put raw user input into the page URL or anchor hrefs (except maybe search queries or harmless stuff, but even then, encode them). For example, building a query param from an input – always encode it.
- **Prevent DOM-based XSS**: DOM-based XSS is when JavaScript in the browser directly manipulates DOM with user input in an unsafe way. We've covered some scenarios (like using innerHTML, or document.write, etc.). Avoid doing those. If you use `window.location.hash` or `search` to pass info, know that an attacker might put something malicious in there (like a fragment with script). If your app reads location.hash to do something, treat it as untrusted input.
- **Throttling input**: If an input triggers expensive operations (like live search hitting an API on each key), throttle or debounce it. This is a performance issue but also can be abused (user script that triggers hundreds of requests per second). Debounce ensures the app won't DoS your own API.
- **Large Inputs**: If you accept large text (like user can paste a whole article), consider imposing client-side limits (like max length in a textarea). This not only prevents huge payloads from hitting your server (potential DoS), but also avoids sluggishness in the browser. Similarly, for file uploads, you can check file size and type on client and give immediate feedback.
- **Encoding Data for Storage**: If you store something in localStorage or IndexedDB (like saving form data for draft), be mindful that an attacker who gains local access (XSS or someone with the machine) could see it. If it's sensitive like a draft of a secret message, maybe encrypt it locally (though key management is an issue – perhaps use a user-supplied passphrase).
- **Clipboard**: If your app interacts with clipboard (copy/paste), ensure you're not copying sensitive data unknowingly or reading clipboard without user action (browsers largely prevent silent clipboard reads/writes for security).
- **File Input Security**: If you allow file uploads, you might want to check file type via input accept filters (e.g., accept=".jpg,.png"). But do note these can be bypassed (the user can force select a different file via browser file picker by typing `*.*` or if an attacker crafted an HTML form). The real check must be server-side. But client can reduce accidents (like user picking wrong file type).
- **No Dangerous URL Schemes**: If user can input a URL (for example, an avatar image URL), validate that it is `http` or `https` (maybe data: URI if you allow) and not `javascript:` or other schemes. Browsers usually won't allow `javascript:` in an `<img src>` but can in an `<a href>`. Also, `data:` URLs could hide content. So either disallow those or have specific handling.
- **Prevent HTML injection**: If you allow user to enter some formatting (like a WYSIWYG editor), use a library that sanitizes or escapes disallowed tags. Many rich text editors output either a JSON structure or HTML; ensure that output is sanitized on submission. Perhaps use a whitelist (only allow bold, italic, links, etc. and strip script/style).

**Example: Validating Form with Yup**  
Yup is a schema validation library that works in browser and Node:

```ts
import * as Yup from "yup";

const signUpSchema = Yup.object({
  username: Yup.string()
    .matches(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/, "Only letters, numbers, underscore allowed")
    .required(),
  password: Yup.string().min(8).max(100).required(),
  email: Yup.string().email().required(),
});

// Later, on form submit:
try {
  await signUpSchema.validate(formData, { abortEarly: false });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof Yup.ValidationError) {
    const errors = err.inner; // array of errors
    // Display errors to user
  }
}
```

This catches things like invalid characters or formats immediately on client. While an attacker could bypass this by manipulating the JS, it's fine because the server should have similar validation. The goal here is user feedback and a second line of defense.

### 5.2 Client-Side Validation Best Practices

Expanding on validation:

- **Consistency with Server**: Try to reuse validation logic/rules between client and server to avoid discrepancies. If using Node, you could share a schema (like using Joi or Yup in both places or define rules in a common format). If not, at least ensure they're logically the same (e.g., both enforce same password policy). This prevents a case where something passes client check but gets rejected by server or vice versa, which could be exploited or cause confusion.
- **Preventing SQLi/NoSQLi**: Traditional SQL injection is a server problem, but you can reduce risk by filtering out dangerous patterns on the client (though not a primary defense!). For example, if expecting a name, you can reject input containing `' OR 1=1--` etc. But be cautious not to block legitimate input (somebody might have an `'` in their name). So better approach: use allowlist patterns (like only letters and spaces for name, if that’s acceptable).
- **Error Message Handling**: When the server returns a validation error (like "Username already taken"), display it clearly. But for security, do not reveal too much. For instance, during registration, if username is taken or email is taken, it's a bit of user enumeration. Many apps still do it because it's user-friendly. A more secure but less friendly approach is "Registration failed" and send email to that address with next steps if it's an account. But that’s overkill for most scenarios. At least at login, we already said to use generic errors.
- **Prevent Overflows**: If dealing with numbers or numeric input, ensure it’s within safe ranges. JavaScript can handle big numbers but backends or databases might not. If user enters a ridiculously large number, possibly it could cause issues on server (like a long processing or overflow in some languages). Put reasonable limits (e.g., an age field doesn't need 10-digit number).
- **Encoding before sending**: As previously stated, use `encodeURIComponent` for query params, JSON.stringify for JSON bodies, etc. That’s part of validation/handling too - making sure data is properly encoded for the context. If you ever use form-data or something, ensure field names and values are properly encoded by the browser (they are if using FormData API).
- **Auto Sanitization**: Some frameworks auto-sanitize outputs (React does for HTML contexts). If you use something like Angular or Vue, they also auto-escape by default. If using an older approach (not likely since this is React context), always remember to sanitize output.
- **Pen Testing and QA**: As part of your process, try inputting unusual or malicious strings into your app's forms. Does anything break? Does any alert pop (indicating possible XSS)? Does data get truncated or mishandled? Use tools like the OWASP ZAP input fields fuzzer or simply manual test with some payloads (like the classic `<script>alert(1)</script>` in each input) to ensure it stays harmless text when shown anywhere.

### 5.3 Preventing Sensitive Data Exposure

Sensitive Data Exposure (OWASP Top 10 A02:2021) refers to accidentally exposing data that should be protected. In the front-end context:

- **Don't Expose Secrets in Frontend**: Reiterating: no secret keys, no private info in the JS bundle or in variables that can be read easily. We covered env vars and such.
- **Mask Sensitive Info**: If your app deals with sensitive data (like credit card numbers, SSN, etc.), consider masking it in the UI when appropriate. For instance, show only last 4 digits of a credit card. If user needs to see full, have them click or hold a button to reveal (and maybe ask for password again depending on how sensitive).
- **Avoid in Logs**: Both browser console logs and any logging service. E.g., don't `console.log(apiResponse)` if it contains personal data. Many users won't open console, but if they do or send logs in bug report, there's data. If using a monitoring tool like LogRocket or Sentry, check their data policies and scrub PII. Sentry allows configuring a list of sensitive keys to sanitize (like anything named "password").
- **In-App Debug Tools**: Sometimes devs leave hidden debug panels or endpoints. Ensure these are removed or disabled in production. For example, an admin debug console or a route `/dev-info` that prints app state. Attackers often look for such things.
- **Browser Storage**: LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and IndexedDB data can be read by any script running on your domain (including injected scripts if XSS occurs). Cookies (non-HttpOnly) too. So store minimum necessary data. For example, if you store user profile data in localStorage for offline use, consider: do you include their email, phone, etc.? If an XSS occurs, that info is stolen. If it's just in memory, XSS still could steal it if currently loaded, but if user navigated away maybe not. Hard call, but lean on not persisting highly sensitive data.
- **Cache-Control**: If your app deals with very sensitive pages (like banking info), consider sending appropriate headers to not cache those pages in browser or to clear them on logout. For SPAs, you can try to programmatically clear things like using `history.replaceState` to remove sensitive info from history after showing it, etc. If you open a new window with sensitive info, perhaps use `window.opener = null` to prevent other windows messing.
- **Snapshots and Previews**: On mobile devices, app screenshots can be a leak. For web, if a user leaves a tab open, someone could shoulder-surf or use back button to see something. Not much you can do at web level except perhaps a timeout that hides data (like a screen saver). Some apps like password managers blur out info after a while.
- **GDPR & Privacy**: If applicable, ensure compliance with data minimization. Only collect what is needed. If your front-end sends analytics or logs that contain user data, evaluate if that's necessary and allowed.
- **Email/URL parameters**: If sending invites or reset links via email that contain tokens, ensure those tokens are one-time use and short-lived. If your front-end gets such token in URL (like reset password token), treat it like a password (because it effectively is temporary auth). E.g., once user resets password, ensure that token is invalidated. And make sure not to log it or expose it.
- **Visible Source**: Remember that the user can view source of the React app (the transpiled code). So don't include comments with TODOs like "TODO: remove admin bypass" or "API key: ...". That has happened. Clean up before shipping.
- **Use Redaction for display**: e.g., for something like an access token display, show asterisks. It's common to give user the ability to copy a token by clicking a button that calls some copy function but not actually show it raw on screen, to avoid over-the-shoulder reading.
- **Test Data Exposure**: Tools like `npm run build` and then analyze bundle for any obvious secrets (sometimes people accidentally include a test private key or something). Use `strings` command on the bundle or some static analysis to see if any sensitive word is present. Also check network calls with devtools - what data is in responses or requests? Are we accidentally retrieving more data than we show (like an API returns SSN but we never use it, should probably have API not send it at all)?

### 5.4 Secure State Management of Sensitive Data

Earlier we talked about not storing sensitive data in Redux, etc. Here are additional points:

- **Transient vs Persistent State**: Keep sensitive info transient (in memory, not persisted to localStorage or cookies unless needed). For example, a one-time password or a CSRf token can be in memory or short-lived cookie rather than stored long-term.
- **Clearing State on Logout**: When user logs out, clear out any user-specific state. This includes Redux stores, context, and also things like IndexedDB if you cached user data. For example, if using service workers and caching API responses, consider clearing those caches on logout if they contain user data. Otherwise, someone who gains the device or next user on same machine (if not single user scenario) could open devtools and see that data.
- **Encryption**: If you have to store something sensitive on client, you could encrypt it with a key derived from the user's password or a PIN. For example, some apps encrypt an offline cache of data so that if someone just gets the browser storage, they'd need to know the user's password to decrypt. This is advanced and often not done for typical web apps due to complexity (since web can't easily prompt for a key each time unless you want user to enter an extra password).
- **Memory Leaks**: In JS, if you have long-running app, ensure you're not accidentally retaining huge objects (like a big data blob) in memory after you don't need it, as that could possibly be extracted via heap snapshots if someone had devtools access or some exploit. This is more theoretical, but good to practice memory management.
- **Sensitive computations**: If doing any cryptographic operations in JS (like hashing a password for some reason on client), be aware of side-channel possibilities (though in JS, side channels are hard to exploit remotely, but timing attacks could in theory come via measuring response times in some scenarios, probably more relevant on server).
- **Avoid Global Event Bus**: Sometimes apps have a global pub-sub or event emitter. If you publish sensitive data on it for any component to hear, it's essentially global. Make sure only intended components receive it. Not as much an issue if within same app, but if you had multiple sub-apps on a page, could they intercept events? Probably not if coded properly.
- **Browser Extensions**: Note that malicious browser extensions can potentially access your app's DOM and maybe JS context (depending on extension content script privileges). You can't fully defend if user runs a malicious extension (that's out of your threat model usually). But just be aware, don't leave keys in global JS objects if not needed, etc.

### 5.5 Protecting Against Injection Attacks

We discussed injection from the perspective of XSS and how to not send injection payloads to server. To summarize defense in client context:

- **Parameterization**: Use proper APIs to send data, never construct code or queries in client context aside from GraphQL variables and URL encoding as covered.
- **Avoid eval**: It keeps coming up because eval can turn text into code. E.g., a user enters `2+2` and you decide to `eval(userInput)` to get 4. That’s silly but possible scenario; they'd also input `while(true){}` and hang the app or `alert(document.cookies)` to attempt XSS. So no eval on user stuff.
- **Sandbox**: If you absolutely need to run user-provided scripts (can't think of a case in a normal app, but say a coding sandbox feature), use a WebWorker or an iframe sandbox attribute to run it in isolation. That’s outside usual app dev, more of building dev tools or similar.
- **Regular Expression DDoS (ReDoS)**: Example: you have a regex to validate email. If it is overly complex, a clever input could cause it to hang or take seconds (ReDoS is a thing). Use known safe regex patterns (or simpler, use built-in validations or libraries that are optimized). E.g., avoid catastrophic backtracking by writing regex carefully.
- **Don't pass user input to `new Function()`**: Same reason as eval.
- **Command Injection**: Usually not applicable on client (no OS commands), but if using some Node features in an Electron app or something, then it's like server environment.
- **SQL injection**: If your client directly uses some storage like IndexedDB or WebSQL, typical injection isn't relevant because those queries don't combine user input in string form, they use APIs. If someone uses WebSQL and does raw SQL with string concatenation, avoid that (WebSQL is deprecated anyway).
- **GraphQL alias or directive injection**: If using user input in a GraphQL alias or such, that's weird, but maybe avoid dynamic aliasing.

### 5.6 Checklist: Data Handling & Validation

- [x] **All input fields validated** for length, format, and requiredness on the client side (with corresponding server checks).
- [x] **No raw dangerous patterns** allowed in inputs (e.g., `<script>` tags are either prevented or will be harmlessly treated as text).
- [x] **User input reflected in UI is escaped/sanitized** (React does by default, and we avoid any innerHTML without sanitization).
- [x] **Client and server validation in sync** (no major contradictions that could be exploited or frustrate user).
- [x] **Sensitive fields (passwords, tokens)** are handled carefully (masked, not logged, cleared after use).
- [x] **No secrets or PII in browser storage** unless absolutely needed (and then encrypted if possible). E.g., JWT maybe as HttpOnly cookie, not localStorage; user profile stored only in memory or session storage with encryption if persisted.
- [x] **Proper encoding used** for any context (URLs, HTML, etc.).
- [x] **No use of eval or similar** on any untrusted data.
- [x] **Data caches cleared on logout** (including service worker caches, if any, and in-memory caches from libraries like React Query or Apollo).
- [x] **Large or potentially problematic input** (files, big text) are capped or chunked to avoid performance or DOS issues.
- [x] **Tested with malicious inputs** (XSS payloads, SQL keywords, long strings) to see that they don't cause harm or excessive load on client.

Having validated and sanitized data on the client, and ensured we don't keep sensitive data around unnecessarily, our front-end is much more robust. Next, we address how to continuously verify and maintain this security posture through testing and DevOps practices.

## 6. Security Testing & CI/CD Best Practices

Integrating security into your development lifecycle is crucial for catching issues early and often. This section will explore:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Tools to analyze your code for security issues without running it.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Scanning the running application for vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, etc.
- **Dependency management and monitoring** as part of CI.
- Setting up a **secure CI/CD pipeline**, including handling secrets and automating security checks.
- Ensuring a DevSecOps approach where security is continuous.

By automating and integrating these, you reduce the chance of a regression introducing a vulnerability unnoticed, and you get assurance that your app remains secure as it evolves.

### 6.1 Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

SAST involves analyzing source code (or compiled code) to find vulnerabilities. For a React/TypeScript app:

- **ESLint Security Plugins**: Leverage ESLint with security-focused rules:
  - **eslint-plugin-security**: Originally for Node, but rules like detecting usage of eval, detecting insecure randomness, etc., can apply.
  - **eslint-plugin-react-security**: A plugin specifically targeting React security issues, created by Snyk ([snyk-labs/eslint-plugin-react-security - GitHub](https://github.com/snyk-labs/eslint-plugin-react-security#:~:text=ESLint%20plugin%20with%20rules%20for,security)). It can catch things like dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage, detecting non-sanitized data flows to DOM sinks, etc.
  - **eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y**: Not security, but good for accessibility (which is a different but important concern).
  - **TypeScript compiler**: Not exactly SAST, but enabling strict flags can be considered a static check to catch risky code. Also, you can use `tsc --noEmit` in CI to just type check.
- **CodeQL**: GitHub offers CodeQL analysis which can find security issues. There are CodeQL queries for JavaScript that might detect some XSS patterns or insecure use of APIs.
- **SonarQube/SonarCloud**: Sonar analysis can include security hotspots detection. For JavaScript/TypeScript, Sonar might identify things like hardcoded credentials, use of eval, etc.
- **Custom Scripts**: You can write simple scripts or use grep in CI to fail build if certain patterns are present. E.g., prevent committing `console.log(password)` or `debugger` or the string "TODO" or "Temporary bypass" which might indicate a dev left something insecure.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Use git hooks (with Husky or similar) to run ESLint and tests before commit or push. This ensures issues are caught even before CI.
- **TSLint**: (Outdated now, replaced by ESLint for TS). If any legacy references, upgrade to ESLint.
- **Focus**: SAST can catch things like:
  - Usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (and whether the content came from a variable).
  - Direct use of `localStorage` for tokens might be flagged by some tools as a warning.
  - Missing `key` props and such (not security but quality).
  - Hardcoded secrets (some scanners search for patterns like API keys).
  - Dependencies with known vulns (though that's more dependency scanning than static code).
- **Running SAST**: Integrate in CI. For instance, if using GitHub, you can set up CodeQL as a workflow. Or use a Snyk GitHub Action for code analysis. Or run ESLint as part of your build step (`npm run lint`).
- **Interpreting Results**: SAST may report false positives. E.g., it might warn that `innerHTML` is used unsafely when you actually sanitized it right before. You can usually mark that as safe (like an eslint ignore comment for that line) after verifying.
- **Example**: Add to your package.json:
  ```json
  "lint:security": "eslint --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx --plugin security --plugin react-security src/"
  ```
  with appropriate `.eslintrc` extending those plugin's recommended configs. Then run `npm run lint:security` in CI.
- **Style and Other Linters**: Not security, but keeping code clean reduces bugs. So continue using Prettier/ESLint for style to avoid messy code where vulns hide.

### 6.2 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

DAST involves scanning the running application (usually via HTTP requests and analyzing responses) to find vulnerabilities:

- **OWASP ZAP**: A popular free tool that can be run in automated or manual mode. You can integrate ZAP in CI to attack a deployed test instance of your app. It can find XSS by injecting payloads and seeing if they execute, check for missing headers, etc.
- **Burp Suite**: Another tool (more often used manually by security testers, but there's Burp Enterprise with automation).
- **Selenium + Security Tests**: You can write automated tests that open the app (maybe via Playwright or Puppeteer), simulate an attack scenario, and verify behavior. For example, test that injecting `<script>` into a form does not result in it executing after form submission (the response should treat it inertly).
- **Fuzz Testing**: Use tools to fuzz input fields or API endpoints with random or known malicious patterns and see if any cause abnormal responses. ZAP has a fuzz feature; also tools like fuzzilli (for JS engine fuzzing, not relevant to app logic).
- **Testing Login Security**: Use DAST to ensure rate limiting (though front-end might not enforce it, if you have an automated test that tries 100 login attempts in a minute, the API should respond with some block or captcha - which you can't fully simulate easily, but you can check for expected error code).
- **Scanning for OWASP Top 10**: Tools often have rules for each Top 10 category. For example, checking that input fields properly encode output (XSS), or that cookies have secure flags, etc. ZAP can alert if cookie missing HttpOnly or secure flag.
- **Performance of DAST**: They can be time-consuming. Possibly run them in a nightly build or a separate pipeline, not on every commit (unless quick).
- **Manual Penetration Testing**: Though not automated CI, it's worth mentioning: schedule periodic manual pen-test or bug bounty on your app. Many subtle logic issues or advanced attacks require human creativity.
- **Integration**: If using CI like Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, etc., you might spin up the app (maybe `npm run build` then `npm run start` in a test environment or use something like `serve` to host the static files) and then run ZAP CLI or API to scan that localhost. There are Docker images for ZAP that you can run in CI.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: DAST isn't just one-time; maybe after each major deployment. If you have staging, maybe run ZAP against staging.

### 6.3 Dependency Scanning & Management

We touched on updating dependencies. In CI/CD:

- **Automated Dependency Updates**: Use tools like Dependabot (GitHub), Renovate, or Greenkeeper to automatically open PRs for new versions of dependencies. Review and test them, and have a fast process to patch if a vulnerability is announced.
- **Vulnerability Database Checks**: Incorporate tools like:
  - **npm audit**: Perhaps in CI with `--audit-level=high` to fail if high or critical vulnerabilities are present. Note: npm audit can sometimes have false alarms or dev-only issues, adjust as needed.
  - **Snyk**: They have CLI and GitHub actions. Snyk can scan both dependencies and code.
  - **Retire.js**: A tool that specifically scans for known vulnerabilities in JS libs (by looking at package files or even in the built bundle to detect vulnerable library versions).
  - **OWASP Dependency Check**: More for backend (Java, etc.), but retire.js covers front-end.
- **Licensing**: Not security, but while scanning dependencies, also ensure none have disallowed licenses if that's a concern for enterprise.
- **Pinning Versions**: Already done with lockfiles, but also consider if you want to fix to specific versions and manually bump rather than `^` ranges that auto-fetch latest on install (with lockfile it won't until you update). Most use lockfiles anyway.
- **Remove Unused**: Periodically, run `depcheck` or manually prune packages not in use. Fewer deps, fewer vulns.
- **Transitive Dependencies**: Many vulns are in transitive deps. Use `npm ls package-name` if you find a vuln and see which top-level needs update or if a patch is available. Snyk helps by suggesting patches or overrides. If a transitive vuln is critical and not fixed upstream, you can use resolution in package.json (for Yarn) or overrides in npm v8+ to force a subdependency version, or temporary patch via `patch-package`.
- **Lockfile Integrity**: In CI, use `npm ci` to install (it ensures it uses lockfile and fails if lock doesn't match package.json).
- **Artifact Scanning**: If your deployment artifact is a Docker image, use container scanning too (though for front-end, that image is often just a web server + static files, still base image could have vulnerabilities).

### 6.4 Secure CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

Your CI/CD pipeline itself should be secure:

- **CI Access**: Make sure CI secrets (like API keys for deployment, etc.) are stored securely in the pipeline (like GitHub Actions secrets). Rotate them if someone who had access leaves.
- **No Secrets in Code**: Ensure that you're not storing secrets in the repo. Use CI env vars or secret files. If you need to supply something to build (like signing key for something), find a secure way or do it outside the build (front-end rarely needs secrets at build except maybe a sentry API key for source maps, which can be restricted).
- **Build Integrity**: Consider verifying that your build output is what you expect. For instance, run tests on the built files to ensure no unexpected global variables or console logs present (some advanced setups do smoke tests on the production build).
- **Deploy Automation**: Use CI to deploy to reduce human error. E.g., GitHub Actions to upload to S3, etc., rather than manual which might miss a step (like setting correct headers).
- **Pre-production Testing**: Ideally, deploy to a staging environment and run DAST or some smoke tests, then promote to production if all clear.
- **Security Unit Tests**: Include some unit/integration tests for security-related functions. For example, if you have a util that sanitizes HTML, add tests to ensure it removes scripts. Or test that your role-based component redirects properly when role is insufficient.
- **Monitoring CI**: If using a SaaS CI, ensure your code and secrets are not accessible to unauthorized. E.g., if using self-hosted runners, secure them; if using open source project on a public CI, be careful with secrets (should not be used in builds triggered by external PRs because they can be printed).

### 6.5 Secrets Management in CI/CD

Even front-end projects have some secrets (deployment keys, API keys for third-party services like Sentry or map services):

- **Use environment variables**: Most CI/CD allow setting env vars or secrets. Use those instead of hardcoding in the code.
- **Secure .env files**: If your build needs a .env, don't commit it. Many CI allow storing an .env securely or constructing it from individual secrets. Or you can use a vault product to inject secrets at build time.
- **Scope of secrets**: Only provide a secret where needed. For instance, an API key for Sentry (to upload source maps) should only be present in the build job and not after. And it's not needed on the deployed app (the app uses a different DSN which might not be secret).
- **Cleaning up**: Make sure that after build, secrets aren't lingering in output. E.g., if you had an env var, ensure it's not accidentally included in a JS bundle. Typically only prefixed env are. But if a secret ends up in bundle (maybe you misnamed it with REACT*APP*), that's a leak.
- **Deployment credentials**: If deploying to AWS S3, the AWS keys in CI should have minimal permissions (only to that bucket, etc.). Use temporary credentials if possible.
- **Notification on security test failure**: If SAST or DAST finds an issue or dependency scan fails, make sure CI marks build failure and notifies the team (via email, Slack, etc.). Treat those as importantly as unit test failures.

### 6.6 Checklist: Security Testing & DevOps

- [x] **ESLint (with security rules) passes** with no serious issues.
- [x] **Static analysis tools (CodeQL/Sonar/Snyk code)** are run and any findings addressed or reviewed.
- [x] **All dependencies checked** for known vulns (via npm audit or third-party) in CI, build fails on high severity issues unless waived with justification.
- [x] **Automated dependency updates** in place (Dependabot or similar) and process to handle them promptly.
- [x] **Regular scans of the running app** using tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp for vulnerabilities not detectable via static analysis.
- [x] **Penetration testing scheduled** (if possible) or bug bounty in place for continuous external testing.
- [x] **CI pipeline** treats security gates as first-class: lint, tests, audit all must pass before merge/deploy.
- [x] **CI secrets secured** and not exposed in logs or artifacts.
- [x] **Release checklist** includes verifying security-related configs (ensuring prod build used, correct env, all keys rotated if needed, etc.).
- [x] **Monitoring of libraries**: Subscribe to security mailing lists or GitHub Security Advisory for critical libs you use (React, Redux, etc.) to hear of any zero-day issues.
- [x] **Backup strategy**: (More for server, but if front-end has any data storage, ensure users won't lose data. E.g., if using service worker for offline, handle upgrades carefully.)

With testing and CI/CD processes covering security, we significantly reduce the chance of introducing vulnerabilities and not noticing. Finally, let's move to securing deployment and monitoring the application in production.

---

## 7. Deployment & Monitoring

Deploying a secure application means using secure settings on hosting platforms and then keeping an eye on the app's behavior in production to detect any anomalies or attacks. In this last section, we'll cover:

- Best practices for securing hosting environments (whether it's AWS S3/CloudFront, Vercel, Netlify, or a custom server).
- Secure configuration for serving the React app (proper headers, file permissions, etc.).
- Setting up logging and monitoring to detect unusual activity.
- Tools for threat detection and alerting (like security monitoring services).
- Planning for incident response so that if a security incident occurs, you're ready to respond.

Combining a secure deployment with effective monitoring ensures that even after code is shipped, you maintain vigilance and can react to new threats.

### 7.1 Secure Hosting and Infrastructure

How you host a React app depends on if it's purely static or with server-side rendering:

- **Static Hosting (S3/CloudFront, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)**:
  - These are mostly read-only file servers for your static files (HTML, JS, CSS).
  - **Permissions**: If using AWS S3, keep your bucket private and use CloudFront to serve (or static site hosting which makes it public but locked to just file serving). Don't allow public PUT access obviously. Many breaches happen by misconfigured S3 buckets.
  - CloudFront or similar CDN gives you HTTPS and DDoS protection out of the box.
  - **Netlify/Vercel**: Provide global CDN, HTTPS, etc. Use their environment variable management for any keys at build time, don't expose admin URLs.
  - Ensure directory listings are disabled (users should not be able to list all files in your bucket via some URL). If using static site configs, that is handled.
  - **Cache Invalidation**: When deploying new versions, make sure old content is invalidated or uses different names (e.g., with contenthash in filenames, which we do). This prevents serving old vulnerable code after an update. Also helps avoid mixed versions (like new HTML but old JS).
  - **Backup static files**: Not security per se, but keep a copy or be able to rebuild exact version if needed (for forensic or rollback if new deploy has issue).
- **Server-side (Node.js SSR or Next.js)**:
  - Then you have an actual server process. Secure it like any Node server:
    - Use Helmet middleware to set headers.
    - Disable or restrict any unsafe eval or VM usage (if not needed).
    - Keep Node and dependencies updated (backend dependencies as well).
    - Use a process manager that auto restarts on crash (so a DoS attempt causing a crash recovers quickly) but better fix root cause.
    - Run with least privileges (container or user with minimal rights).
  - Ensure that SSR doesn't introduce new injection vectors (like if you use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to hydrate state, make sure to JSON-escape it properly).
  - If using Next.js, it provides a lot out of box, but still set ENV properly and check their security documentation (Next has recommendations like disabling x-powered-by header, which they do by default).
- **Reverse Proxies**: If using Nginx/Apache in front:
  - Configure TLS strongly (as mentioned TLS 1.2+, strong ciphers).
  - Set appropriate headers at this layer too if easier (e.g., HSTS).
  - Limit upload size if your app handles file uploads via proxy to backend (to avoid huge uploads).
  - Implement rate limiting if needed at proxy (e.g., if you want to block too many requests from one IP).
- **Content Delivery Network**: Use a CDN to serve static assets. This offloads traffic and can absorb some attacks. Cloudflare or CloudFront can also provide Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to filter malicious requests (like obvious XSS probes).
- **DNS Security**: Use a reputable DNS (and consider DNSSEC if it's critical). DNS hijacks could send users to a malicious server. Also, lock your domain registrar (use 2FA, etc.).
- **Secrets on Server**: Even if front-end is static, sometimes there's some secrets (like an API key for sending forms to email). If so, keep them in server-side functions (Netlify functions or a small backend) rather than exposing to client.
- **Third-party Scripts**: When deploying, audit any third-party tags you include (analytics, etc.). They run on your page and could potentially be an avenue for injection if compromised. Use subresource integrity (SRI) for any scripts you include via `<script src="...">` from a CDN, where possible, to ensure the content hasn't been tampered ([React XSS: Advanced Strategies for Mitigating Security Threats](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/react-xss-advanced-strategies-for-mitigating-security-threats#:~:text=React%20XSS%3A%20Advanced%20Strategies%20for,as%20text%20onto%20the)) ([React XSS: Advanced Strategies for Mitigating Security Threats](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/react-xss-advanced-strategies-for-mitigating-security-threats#:~:text=Escaping%20Strings%3A%20React%20automatically%20escapes,as%20text%20onto%20the)).
- **Backup/Recovery**: Although a React app can be redeployed from code, ensure your CI/CD pipeline or you have backups of environment config. Also, consider storing last known good build if a new build gets compromised (rare, but if your build system was hacked to produce malicious code, you want to roll back quickly).
- **Containers**: If you containerize the front-end (some do for SSR or just to serve static), scan the container for vulns, use minimal base image (alpine or distroless if possible), no unnecessary packages inside.

### 7.2 Secure Deployment Configurations

Configuration details to double-check:

- **Production Mode**: Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` (for any Node/SSR or build processes). We covered how that strips dev warnings etc.
- **Source Maps**: If you decide to deploy source maps (for easier debugging in production or error tracking), be cautious. Host them privately if possible (like behind auth or only send to error service). If you can't, at least don't include them in index.html (hidden from casual users). Source maps can reveal code logic or sensitive comments. Many choose not to deploy them at all, or only upload to Sentry.
- **Environment Vars**: On hosting (like Netlify), make sure env vars marked as "private" or not exposed to client unless needed. For example, Netlify has a flag to expose certain vars to front-end. Only expose ones meant to be public (which essentially means they're not secrets).
- **HTTP/2 or HTTP/3**: Use newer protocols if available; they have security improvements and performance (though not directly a vulnerability thing, but for robustness).
- **Frameguards**: Already cover via headers (CSP frame-ancestors or XFO).
- **Cookie Settings**: If your app sets cookies (maybe for preferences or an auth token cookie), set `Secure` and `HttpOnly` where appropriate, and `SameSite`. If using Netlify Identity or Auth0, check their cookie settings.
- **Error Pages**: Configure error pages for 404/500 that don't reveal internal info. E.g., if using Netlify, you can have a generic 500 error page. If using your own server, catch errors and show a friendly message. This is user experience but also make sure internal stack traces aren't shown.
- **Robots.txt / Security.txt**: For security by obscurity, you might not want to list admin routes in robots.txt. Also consider adding a `security.txt` file (a standard for disclosing security contact) so researchers can easily report issues they find. It's not code security, but process.
- **Monitoring toggles**: If you have any monitoring or analytics in code, ensure they are disabled or using a production key in production, and not accidentally logging debug info. E.g., `console.log` mania in dev should be off in prod.
- **Feature Flags on Deployment**: Decide which features (if any flagged) are on or off for that release, and double-check they are set correctly. It's easy to accidentally leave a flag on if you toggled for testing.
- **Inter-application Security**: If your React app calls multiple APIs (microservice architecture), coordinate CORS and auth across them. Perhaps use an API gateway to unify and secure that.

### 7.3 Logging and Monitoring

Once deployed, keep an eye on the app:

- **Client-side Error Tracking**: Use a tool like **Sentry**, **LogRocket**, or **Datadog RUM** to capture front-end errors and performance metrics. These can catch if an XSS happened (maybe you'll see an error or console log from the payload) or other issues.
  - Sentry can also track if a new error spikes after a deploy, which could indicate something malicious or broken.
  - Ensure these tools are configured not to collect PII or at least minimize it (they usually scrub by default things like credit card numbers in errors).
- **Custom Event Logging**: If there's a security relevant event, like multiple failed login attempts (tracked on client if you do client-side lockout), you might send an event to your analytics or monitoring.
- **Network Monitoring**: Use browser's Report API to get CSP violation reports (CSP can send a JSON to an endpoint when it blocks something). This way you get alerted if someone attempted an XSS (CSP blocked a script). Set `report-uri` or `report-to` in CSP header pointing to a service (you can use Report URI or roll your own collection endpoint).
- **Performance Monitoring**: Sometimes a performance issue can indicate malicious activity (like if someone is scraping your site heavily, your load times may go up for others). But mostly monitors user experience.
- **Server-side Logging**: If you have an SSR server or any backend, obviously log important events (logins, errors) with context. For static, CloudFront or Netlify have access logs, which you could examine for suspicious patterns (like repeated requests to non-existent admin panel could indicate someone scanning).
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for:
  - Unusual spikes in 4xx/5xx errors (could be an attack or some bug).
  - Multiple CSP violations in short time.
  - Traffic from unexpected geographies (if applicable, though front-end is global usually).
  - If using WAF/Cloudflare, alerts on blocked attacks.
- **User Session Monitoring**: If high-security app, sometimes front-end might detect if user's session might be stolen. Hard to do purely front-end, but maybe detect if IP or user agent changes mid session (though that's more for backend to see and kill session). But front-end could notice and prompt re-login if it detects something off via a signal from server.
- **Integrate Monitoring Tools**: e.g., Sentry for errors, Google Analytics for user flows (and to detect if weird pages are being hit often by bots), Cloudflare for WAF and its analytics.
- **Data Leakage Monitoring**: Ensure you're not accidentally logging sensitive data in these monitoring tools. For example, Sentry captures console logs and network requests in its breadcrumb by default. Make sure auth tokens or passwords are not in those (usually they wouldn't be unless you log them).
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Use Pingdom or similar to ensure your site is up (not exactly security, but downtime could be from attacks, and you'll want to know ASAP).

### 7.4 Runtime Threat Detection

Beyond passive monitoring:

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: If you have one (Cloudflare, AWS WAF, etc.), configure rules to detect common attacks: SQLi payloads, XSS payloads, etc. These will block malicious requests. E.g., AWS WAF has an OWASP Top 10 rule set you can apply.
- **Client-side Anti-Fraud**: Some apps include JS to detect bot behavior or known malicious patterns (like automated clicks). If your app is high-target (e.g., banking, ticketing system that scalpers attack), consider adding CAPTCHA on risky actions or using fingerprinting libraries to detect multiple accounts from same device, etc.
- **Content Tampering Detection**: One advanced concept: using Subresource Integrity for scripts ensures if your CDN is compromised and script changed, it won't run (browser will block it). If you host your own, less issue, but for external ones, include SRI hashes.
- **Detecting Unexpected Changes**: If using service worker for PWA, it can sometimes be used to check integrity of files (the SW can verify hash of important files). Not typical, but an idea.
- **Alert on Admin Pages**: If you have an admin section not meant for public, have a honeytoken/alert if someone who isn't supposed to tries to access it. E.g., even if it's client-protected, if a request for /admin comes in for non-admin, log that occurrence.
- **Bot Detection**: Many attacks are bots. Use tools or custom logic to detect headless browsers or script-like behavior. e.g., if someone completes a multi-step form in 1 second, likely a bot - maybe require extra verification.
- **CSP Reports**: As mentioned, CSP violation reports are real-time threat indicators (someone tried to inject script).
- **Dependency Alerts in Runtime**: There are services that monitor your site, parse the JS and detect library versions and known issues (similar to retire.js but running externally). They can alert if you still use a vulnerable version in production.
- **User Reports**: Provide an easy way for users to report security issues or suspicious activity (like a "Report a bug/security issue" link to your support or security email). Sometimes user-reported incidents are first sign (e.g., "I got logged in as someone else!" which could indicate a serious session issue).

### 7.5 Incident Response Planning

No system is 100% secure. Plan for incidents:

- **Runbooks**: Document steps for different incident types:
  - Data breach (what if user data exposure is discovered?)
  - XSS attack in production (how to mitigate quickly? likely update CSP to block, patch code, force logout users if needed).
  - Stolen credentials (mass reset? have a way to force logout all sessions).
  - Service compromise (if a dependency or CDN is compromised).
- **Team Contacts**: Know who to contact in case of an incident (security officer, engineers, PR if needed). Have after-hours contact if your app is critical and incident happens off hours.
- **User Communication**: Have templates or plans for notifying users if needed. E.g., if a serious breach, you might need to email all users to reset passwords, etc. That plan typically exists at org level.
- **Backups**: If data is corrupted or ransomed (for front-end, not so relevant since we don't store data, but if SSR maybe sessions or something).
- **Logging Preservation**: In incident, logs are vital for forensic. Ensure your logs (front-end and back-end) are stored and not overwritten quickly. For example, if using CloudFront, enable access log to S3; for application, keep error logs. Also Sentry logs.
- **Practice**: Do a practice drill or tabletop exercise: "Imagine XSS was found on our site, what do we do?" Walk through and ensure holes are covered (like, do we know how to quickly patch and invalidate cache? Who do we notify?).
- **Versioning**: Keep track of exactly what version is deployed. If alerted to a vulnerability, know if your current version is affected or if it's an old one. Good CI naming and ability to roll back to a known safe version is key.
- **Third-party incidents**: If a library you use announces a zero-day vulnerability, plan to respond quickly (bump version, redeploy). Subscribe to their announcements so you don't find out too late.
- **Post-incident**: Have a process to do root cause analysis and improve. If an XSS happened and was fixed, add a test case for it, improve coding guideline to avoid that pattern, etc.

### 7.6 Checklist: Deployment & Monitoring

## 8. Conclusion

Building a secure ReactJS and TypeScript application requires diligence at every step of the development lifecycle. We started from a secure foundation—setting up the project with best practices in package management and configuration—because a strong base reduces later risk. We then focused on writing secure UI code: using TypeScript to our advantage, avoiding dangerous patterns that could lead to XSS or injections, and carefully handling state and data on the client side.

Authentication and authorization were addressed with modern approaches (OAuth2 PKCE, JWTs with HttpOnly cookies, robust RBAC, and MFA) to ensure only the right users access the right features, and that even if credentials are stolen, additional defenses mitigate damage. We configured secure communications, making sure all data exchanges happen over encrypted channels, preventing CSRF, and correctly setting up CORS without holes. Our data handling on the client side acts as a first line of defense and a way to inform users, complementing server-side validation and protecting the front-end from processing malicious data.

Crucially, we integrated security into testing and deployment. Automated tools (linters, SAST/DAST scanners, dependency checkers) in our CI pipeline continuously watch the code and its libraries for weaknesses, so we catch issues early—before they reach production. Our deployment configurations and hosting follow the principle of least privilege and secure defaults, meaning the live app runs with appropriate safeguards like CSP, HSTS, and secure cookies. Monitoring ensures that if something does slip through or a new threat emerges, we will detect it quickly—whether it's an error crash, a suspicious traffic pattern, or an attempted XSS that CSP thankfully blocked.

Security is not a one-time effort but a continuous process. As you maintain and expand your React application, keep the OWASP Top 10 in mind as a baseline of threats:

- Injection flaws (SQL, NoSQL, command injection) are mitigated by how we send data (always parameterized and validated).
- Cross-Site Scripting is guarded by React's escaping, our avoidance of dangerous HTML insertion, and a strong Content Security Policy ([XSS in React — xss 0.0.1 documentation](https://web-security-react.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/xss_in_react.html#:~:text=JSX%20Prevents%20Injection%20attacks%C2%B6)).
- Broken Authentication is prevented by our careful session/token management and MFA ([React Security Vulnerabilities that you should never ignore! | Simform](https://www.simform.com/blog/react-security-vulnerabilities-solutions/#:~:text=%3A)).
- Sensitive Data Exposure is reduced by always using HTTPS and not storing or leaking sensitive info on the client ([webpack - How Secure are Environment Variables in REACTJS that using .env in the root of project? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74310818/how-secure-are-environment-variables-in-reactjs-that-using-env-in-the-root-of-p#:~:text=If%20the%20application%20runs%20on,the%20response%20to%20the%20client)).
- Broken Access Control is handled via thorough RBAC both in UI and assured on server ([React Security Vulnerabilities that you should never ignore! | Simform](https://www.simform.com/blog/react-security-vulnerabilities-solutions/#:~:text=)).
- Security Misconfiguration is avoided through our diligent configuration of Webpack, headers, and cloud settings ([React Security Vulnerabilities that you should never ignore! | Simform](https://www.simform.com/blog/react-security-vulnerabilities-solutions/#:~:text=)).
- Using Vulnerable Components is addressed by our dependency update strategy and scanning ([React Security Vulnerabilities that you should never ignore! | Simform](https://www.simform.com/blog/react-security-vulnerabilities-solutions/#:~:text=,Known%20Vulnerabilities)).
- Identification and Authentication Failures (like session fixation or missing logout) are mitigated by our auth flow design.
- Software and Data Integrity Failures (supply chain issues) we counter by locking dependencies and verifying builds.
- And Logging/Monitoring is in place so we don't fly blind and can react (fulfilling OWASP's requirement for good Logging & Monitoring ([React Security Vulnerabilities that you should never ignore! | Simform](https://www.simform.com/blog/react-security-vulnerabilities-solutions/#:~:text=,Monitoring))).

By following the guide and the checklists, you ensure that your React & TypeScript application is built with a security-first mindset. Of course, no checklist can cover every scenario, and new vulnerabilities or edge cases can arise. But with the secure development lifecycle practices we've put in place, you'll be able to adapt and respond to new threats. The result is an application that users can trust with their data and transactions, and that you as a developer can be confident in as it goes live to the world.

Finally, always keep learning and stay updated on security best practices. The web security landscape evolves, and so should your skills. Regularly review resources like the OWASP Top 10, React security articles, and reports of breaches to glean lessons for your own work. Security is an ongoing journey, but with the solid foundation you've built following this guide, you're well on your way to a safe and successful React application.

**Secure Coding Motto**: _"Build it like everyone's trying to break it."_ If you assume an attacker will try every trick in the book (because they will), you'll naturally develop with more caution and defensive thinking. And that makes all the difference in delivering a secure application.
